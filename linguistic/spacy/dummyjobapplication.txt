As a highly skilled project manager with 11 years of experience, I am writing to express my interest in the project manager position at your company. Im 15 years old. My experience aligns well, as I have worked in project management for several years with a prominent retailer, and I know I would make a valuable addition to your team. 
After working for over a decade in project management, I have advanced knowledge in developing scopes, keeping projects moving, submitting deliverables on time, and ensuring a seamless experience for all parties involved. Moreover, while my previous position afforded me a well-rounded skillset, including excellent relationship building and time management skills, I excel at: 
Outlining project scopes, managing timelines, and deadlines. Tracking and reporting on overall progress. Managing daily operations and implementation of new programs. Forecasting project revenue and ensuring all goals are met. 
In addition to my experience and relationship-building experience, I have a solid educational foundation and a passion for furthering projects that build loyalty and, in turn, grow revenue for your organization. I would much appreciate the opportunity to contribute to your ongoing growth and continued success. 
Please review my attached application for additional details regarding my expertise and achievements. Do not hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification on my experience. I would love to meet with you and discuss this position in detail. 
Thank you for your consideration. 
Sincerely, John Doe
