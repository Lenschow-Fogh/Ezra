            "text": "At least two organizations have decided to drop Morgan Freeman after eight women accused him of inappropriate behavior and sexual harassment. Women who previously worked with the Oscar-winning actor told CNN that he repeatedly made comments about their bodies or their clothing and frequently engaged in inappropriate touching. In response to the allegations, Visa announced it had suspended him from its marketing campaign.  We are aware of the allegations that have been made against Mr. Freeman. At this point, Visa will be suspending our marketing in which the actor is featured,  Visa said in a statement. TransLink, Vancouver\u2019s public transit system, also decided to stop using Freeman\u2019s voice as part of an ad campaign to promote its Visa credit card and mobile payments on bus and Skytrain operations.  In light of information we\u2019ve learned ... of allegations regarding actor Morgan Freeman, TransLink has decided to pause his voice announcements as part of a Visa ad campaign on our transit system,  the transit system said a statement.  We will be reaching out to Visa to discuss further.  A few hours after the report was released, Freeman, 80, issued an apology:  Anyone who knows me or has worked with me knows I am not someone who would intentionally offend or knowingly make anyone feel uneasy, I apologize to anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected \u2014 that was never my intent.  A production assistant working on the 2015 film  Going in Style  said Morgan made numerous comments about her body, asked her several times if she was wearing underwear and tried to lift her skirt. Another worker on the set said women wore loose-fitting clothing in an effort to avoid Freeman\u2019s attention. Entertainment Tonight released footage on Thursday evening of two on-air interviews with Freeman that also revealed his attitude toward women. During an interview for the 2016 film  London Has Fallen,  Freeman asked a young female reporter,  My goodness, are you married? Fool around with other guys? I\u2019m just asking.  In 2015, he told author Janet Mock:  You got a dress halfway between your knee and your hips, and you sit down right across from me and you cross your legs.  Mock, who was a special correspondent for the interview, said Freeman\u2019s treatment of her was an  exhibition of the casual nature at which men in positions of power believe that everything belongs to them, including women\u2019s bodies.  Freeman\u2019s union, SAG-AFTRA, is considering what to do about Freeman\u2019s Life Achievement Award. The award is given to actors who represent the  finest ideals of the acting profession,  CNN reported.  These are compelling and devastating allegations which are absolutely contrary to all the steps that we are taking to ensure a safe work environment,  the union said in a statement.  Any accused person has the right to due process, but it is our starting point to believe the courageous voices who come forward to report incidents of harassment ... we are reviewing what corrective actions may be warranted at this time.

            "text": "The best way to watch Harvey Weinstein walk himself into a Manhattan police precinct on Friday morning was via NBC News\u2019 Periscope. As the former Oscar-winning Hollywood producer and  king of indie film  marched from his black car into the police station, NBC correspondent Craig Melvin began naming some of the 95 women who have come forward with allegations against Weinstein \u2015 Lucia Evans, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Uma Thurman, Salma Hayek. Reaction icons started floating up the right side of the screen, little hearts of different colors, one after another after another, until they formed a cloud of  likes.  We, the people of the internet, were engaging in a collective act of schadenfreude, and it was delicious. Women are so often told to contain our anger, to make it more palatable, less  aggressive,  small enough to contain within the male prerogative. But I\u2019m angry at men like Harvey Weinstein, and there\u2019s nothing palatable about it.  The man who beckoned young women to his hotel rooms for the sole purpose of using them, who hired ex-Mossad agents to track anyone liable to expose him, who had vast resources at his fingertips and used them liberally to try to silence the dozens of women he (allegedly) victimized \u2015 even that man is no longer untouchable.  That man had to walk past reporters as he entered a police station, submitting to the cheap cop pornography of the perp walk. That man looked haggard and tilted his head low to avoid eyes and questions. That man also carried two books with him into the police station, biographies of Big Men in Show Biz \u2014 Elia Kazan, and Rodgers and Hammerstein \u2014 because he is, after all, exactly the kind of prick who fancies himself both a legend and a victim of a pious mob. That man was charged with rape, committing a criminal sex act, sexual abuse and sexual misconduct.  It is still shocking to see powerful men face criminal charges for harming women, and even more shocking to see them convicted. And the process leading up to that \u2015 the public offerings of private pain (hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers \u2026), the scrutiny of that pain, the way it\u2019s picked apart and held up to the light and valued according to how neatly it can be added to a pile of other women\u2019s pain \u2015 is not a pretty one. The rapid rise of the Me Too movement has been exhilarating to witness but also exhausting.  There are few moments of relief when an eternity of systemic abuse is being unpacked and processed. When those moments do present themselves, your instinct is to seize them like a prize. Weinstein is the man behind some of the most recognizable films of my lifetime, but surely the footage many of us will most remember him for is Friday\u2019s walk. A big man in a blue sweater, displayed like any other perp for our delectation, tokens of self-pity and self-regard in the crook of his arm.  As Rose McGowan tweeted Friday morning:  We got you, Harvey Weinstein, we got you.  I hope all 95 women who have said Weinstein violated them saw the footage, and I hope they let themselves feel even a nanosecond of pleasure. When (some) men are (finally) held accountable for their abuses, it does not undo the pain and damage they\u2019ve wrought. But maybe, just maybe, it feels damn good to watch. "

            "text": "Multiple women have accused actor Morgan Freeman of inappropriate behavior and harassment. The allegations surfaced Thursday in a report from CNN, with eight individuals telling the network that they were victims of harassment and inappropriate behavior by Freeman. Sixteen people in total spoke to CNN about the actor\u2019s alleged behavior as part of the investigation. An unidentified woman told the network she was harassed by Freeman in 2015 while working as a production assistant for the comedy  Going in Style  starring the famed actor. The woman said Freeman often touched her inappropriately and made comments about her body and clothing daily. Freeman  kept trying to lift up my skirt and asking if I was wearing underwear  at one point while they worked together, the woman alleged. Actor Alan Arkin  made a comment telling him to stop. Morgan got freaked out and didn\u2019t know what to say.  Another woman told CNN that while working on the 2012 movie  Now You See Me,  Freeman sexually harassed her multiple times.  He did comment on our bodies,  the second accuser told CNN.  We knew that if he was coming by ... not to wear any top that would show our breasts, not to wear anything that would show our bottoms, meaning not wearing clothes that [were] fitted,  she said. Other inappropriate behavior included staring at women\u2019s breasts, massaging an intern\u2019s shoulders, asking a woman how she felt about sexual harassment and asking women to twirl for him, according to CNN. TransLink, Vancouver\u2019s major transportation company, said it would be suspending new voiceovers that featured Freeman as part of an ad campaign for Visa. In a statement, Freeman said he is not someone who would  intentionally offend.   Anyone who knows me or has worked with me knows I am not someone who would intentionally offend or knowingly make anyone feel uneasy,  he said.  I apologize to anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected \u2015 that was never my intent.  This has been updated with TransLink\u2019s response to the allegations.  "

            "text": "When it comes to New York Jets players kneeling during the national anthem, team chairman Christopher Johnson is a standup guy. Johnson said the team wouldn\u2019t fine any player for protesting, despite a new NFL owner-approved measure that enables teams to do so, according to reports. Wednesday\u2019s rule change says players must stand for the anthem or stay off the field. If any player kneels, his team would face a league fine. Teams can discipline individual players.  As I have in the past, I will support our players wherever we land as a team,  Johnson said in a statement, according to the New York Post.  Our focus is not on imposing any Club rules, fines, or restrictions. Instead we will continue to work closely with our players to constructively advance social justice issues that are important to us. I remain extremely proud of how we demonstrated unity last season as well as our players\u2019 commitment to strengthening our communities.  Johnson elaborated on his pledge not to fine players in an interview with Newsday.   I do not like imposing any club-specific rules,  he said.  If somebody (on the Jets) takes a knee, that fine will be borne by the organization, by me, not the players.  I never want to put restrictions on the speech of our players. Do I prefer they stand? Of course. But I understand if they feel the need to protest. There are some big, complicated issues that we\u2019re all struggling with, and our players are on the front lines.  Johnson\u2019s stance could get interesting in the team\u2019s hierarchy. He has been designated as the acting owner while his brother, team owner Woody Johnson, serves as President Donald Trump\u2019s ambassador to the United Kingdom, CBS Sports pointed out. Trump, who has repeatedly criticized demonstrating players, applauded the new NFL edict.  You have to stand proudly for the national anthem or you shouldn\u2019t be playing,  he said. The NFL Players Association criticized the league for failing to consult the union before the change, and vowed to carefully review the new policy. "

            "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Donald Trump administration has launched a national security investigation into car and truck imports that could lead to new U.S. tariffs similar to those imposed on imported steel and aluminum in March. The national security probe under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 would investigate whether vehicle and parts imports were threatening the industry\u2019s health and ability to research and develop new, advanced technologies, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday.  There is evidence suggesting that, for decades, imports from abroad have eroded our domestic auto industry,  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement, promising a  thorough, fair and transparent investigation.  Higher tariffs could be particularly painful for Asian automakers including Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co, Honda Motor Co and Hyundai Motor Co, which count the United States as a key market, and the announcement sparked a broad sell-off in automakers\u2019 shares across the region.  The governments of Japan, China and South Korea said they would monitor the situation, while Beijing, which is increasingly eyeing the United States as a potential market for its cars, added that it would defend its interests.  China opposes the abuse of national security clauses, which will seriously damage multilateral trade systems and disrupt normal international trade order,  Gao Feng, spokesman at the Ministry of Commerce, said at a regular news briefing on Thursday which focused largely on whether Beijing and Washington are making any progress in their growing trade dispute.  We will closely monitor the situation under the U.S. probe and fully evaluate the possible impact and resolutely defend our own legitimate interests.  The probe comes as Trump courts voters in the U.S. industrial heartland ahead of mid-term elections later this year, and opens a new front in his  America First  trade agenda aimed at clawing back manufacturing jobs lost to overseas competitors. It could raise the costs for overseas automakers to export vehicles and parts to the world\u2019s second-largest auto market. Growing trade tensions over cars and car parts, particularly with China, could raise risks for U.S. companies expanding their presence in the country, signs of which are already emerging. Earlier this month, Reuters reported that Ford Motor Co\u2019s imported vehicles were being held up at Chinese ports, adding to a growing list of U.S. products facing issues at China\u2019s borders. The majority of vehicles sold in the United States by Japanese and South Korean automakers are produced there, but most firms also export to the U.S. from plants in Asia, Mexico, Canada and other countries. Roughly one-third of all U.S. vehicle imports last year were from Asia. In addition to recently imposed 25 percent tariffs on steel and 10 percent tariffs on aluminum imports, the administration has threatened tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods over intellectual property complaints, and Beijing has vowed to respond. The administration is also trying to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement to return more auto production to the United States. Commerce said the new probe would determine whether lost domestic production had weakened the U.S.  internal economy  and its ability to develop connected vehicle systems, autonomous vehicles, fuel cells, electric motors and batteries, and advanced manufacturing processes. In a separate statement, Trump said:  Core industries such as automobiles and automotive parts are critical to our strength as a Nation.  A Trump administration official said before the announcement that the expected move was aimed partly at pressuring Canada and Mexico to make concessions in talks to update the NAFTA that have languished in part over auto provisions, as well as pressuring Japan and the European Union, which also export large numbers of vehicles to the United States. An ad hoc industry group representing the largest Japanese, German and other foreign automakers called  Here for America,  criticized the effort.  To our knowledge, no one is asking for this protection. This path leads inevitably to fewer choices and higher prices for cars and trucks in America,  said John Bozzella, chief executive of Global Automakers, a trade group representing Toyota, Nissan Motor Co Ltd, Hyundai Motor Co and others. A Toyota spokeswoman said that the company was monitoring the situation. Chinese automaker Geely Holding Group urged free trade practices for the auto industry, which is built on a complex supply chain under which vehicle components for any given car often originates from numerous countries.  As a global manufacturer, Geely Holding Group is in favor of free trade and open markets. Free trade creates jobs, wealth and economic growth,  a spokesman said, adding that its plant in South Carolina to produce its Volvo brand cars showed its commitment to the country. Shares in Toyota, Honda and Hyundai each fell roughly 3 percent in local trade following the announcement, while Mazda Motor Corp, which does not have any U.S. production capacity at the moment, tumbled more than 5 percent. Late last week, Japan\u2019s automakers\u2019 association urged its export partners to keep tariffs on vehicles and components low and maintain free trade relationships. Roughly 12 million cars and trucks were produced in the United States last year, while the country imported 8.3 million vehicles worth $192 billion. This included 2.4 million from Mexico, 1.8 million from Canada, 1.7 million from Japan, 930,000 from South Korea and 500,000 from Germany, according to U.S. government statistics. At the same time, the United States exported nearly 2 million vehicles worldwide worth $57 billion. German automakers Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG and BMW AG all have large U.S. assembly plants. The United States is the second-biggest export destination for German auto manufacturers after China, while vehicles and car parts are Germany\u2019s biggest source of export income. Asked if the measures would hit Mexico and Canada, a Mexican source close to the NAFTA talks said:  That probably is going to be the next battle.

            "text": "President Donald Trump told reporters Thursday that he is pardoning late heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson, who was arrested in 1912 for driving his white girlfriend across state lines. Trump indicated last month he was considering pardoning the boxer at the urging of actor Sylvester Stallone, who was present at Thursday\u2019s announcement at the White House.  Johnson, the first black man to earn the title of heavyweight boxing champion of the world, died in 1946 after serving time for violating the Mann Act, which banned traveling with a woman across state lines for an  immoral purpose.   Johnson served 10 months in federal prison for what many view as a racially motivated injustice,  Trump said Thursday.  He was treated very rough, very tough.  The son of former slaves, Johnson gained fame and wealth through his boxing career despite rampant racism and violence against blacks at the time. Obama, however, kept to the presidential tradition of almost never granting a posthumous pardon.  "

            "text": "President Donald Trump vocalized his support for the National Football League\u2019s new rule that requires players to stand during the national anthem, telling Fox News that perhaps the players who refuse to abide  shouldn\u2019t be in the country.  The NFL approved the policy on Wednesday in a push to end kneeling during the anthem, which Colin Kaepernick began in 2016 football season as a silent protest in the face of rising racial violence and police brutality. The players not on board will have to stay in the locker room.  Trump praised the league for the new rule that would stop national anthem protests before they happen, saying NFL owners did the right thing.   I don\u2019t think people should be staying in locker rooms,  Trump told Fox News.  You have to stand proudly for the national anthem or you shouldn\u2019t be playing. You shouldn\u2019t be there. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t be in the country.  Trump has derided players and team owners for the kneeling protests on multiple occasions, sparking a debate as to whether the protests were disrespectful of the U.S. military or an expression of First Amendment rights.  NFL commissioner Roger Goodell addressed the controversy in a statement after the new rule was announced that  on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of NFL players were unpatriotic.  At an Alabama rally in September, Trump called players who kneeled a  son of a bitch  and encouraged fans to boycott games when the protests occurred. The president has continued to bring up the issue and alluded to it while welcoming NASCAR Champion Martin Truex Jr. to the White House on Monday.  And I will tell you one thing I know about NASCAR: They do indeed, Brian, stand for the playing of the national anthem, right?  Trump said on Monday.  They do indeed.  Others from the Trump administration have praised the NFL\u2019s rule change on Wednesday, including Vice President Mike Pence and the president\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr. Pence, who left an Indianapolis Colts game after players kneeled last year, posted a screenshot of the news and captioned it  #winning  on Twitter. Trump Jr. posted a similar tweet on Wednesday captioning an AP article with  STILL NOT SICK OF #WINNING!!!!   Despite the Trump administration\u2019s celebrations on Twitter, however, the rule may not be the end of kneeling protests.  The NFL Player\u2019s Association, which has supported the players\u2019 right to protest, issued a release on Wednesday stating it would review the new rule and challenge any aspect inconsistent with its collective bargaining agreement.   The NFL chose to not consult the union in the development of this \u2018policy,\u2019 the statement said.  NFL players have shown their patriotism through their social activism, their community service, in support of our military and law enforcement and yes, through their protests to raise awareness about the issues they care about.   Other Twitter users have noted that the NFL is made up of predominantly black athletes, who could decide to boycott the ruling together.   The NFL is about 70% black,  tweeted Dominque Hamilton, a former University of Missouri football player.  If united and didn\u2019t take the field at all, it would upset a lot of people and a lot of executives.  "

            "text": "The NFL on Wednesday approved a new policy to intercept national anthem protests before they happen, according to the league. The measure mandates that players who are on the field must stand for the national anthem but can remain in the locker room if they choose. Teams could be fined by the league if their players sit or kneel, as many have done in protest of racial injustice and police brutality in recent seasons after NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick\u2019s initial kneeling protest in 2016 earned nationwide attention. The fining or punishment of players and other personnel would be dictated by the individual teams. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell noted in a statement Wednesday that  on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of NFL players were unpatriotic.   This season, all league and team personnel shall stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem,  he said.  Personnel who choose not to stand for the Anthem may stay in the locker room until after the Anthem has been performed.  The NFL Players Association criticized the league for failing to consult with the union on the matter.  Our union will review the new \u2018policy\u2019 and challenge any aspect of it that is inconsistent with the collective bargaining agreement,  the union said. On Tuesday, Sports Illustrated reported on a different, apparently scrapped, proposal in which teams could be penalized on the field for players kneeling. In that scenario, the home team would decide whether both teams would come out of the locker room for  The Star-Spangled Banner.  And if the teams do emerge and players kneel, officials could assess a 15-yard penalty, the outlet wrote, citing unnamed sources.  As always, conversations at league meetings are candid, thoughtful and thorough,  NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told HuffPost in an email early Wednesday.  The clubs explore every option and idea on any policy, and discuss the merits and drawbacks of each approach. We will continue the conversation this morning.  The league also debated the issue in previous meetings since former 49ers quarterback Kaepernick sparked national controversy in the 2016 season by taking a knee during the anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. The movement, which grew to include other players and teams, continued in 2017, prompting repeated outrage from President Donald Trump. Kaepernick, who was not signed by an NFL team in 2017 after he became a free agent, and former teammate Eric Reid, who also protested, have filed grievances against the league for allegedly conspiring to keep them off NFL rosters because of the demonstrations.

            "text": "A legal defense fund created in the wake of the Me Too movement is confronting two of the largest employers in the United States about sexual harassment in the workplace. The Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, housed by the National Women\u2019s Law Center, on Tuesday announced new efforts to tackle claims of sexual misconduct at McDonald\u2019s and Walmart. Female cooks and cashiers at McDonald\u2019s, with the financial support of the defense fund, have filed 10 charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in recent days against restaurant locations in nine cities, including Detroit, Los Angeles and New Orleans. One McDonald\u2019s worker in Chicago alleges that a manager asked her if she wanted to see his penis, and described  lurid fantasies  about what he would like to do to her. She said she was fired when she reported the harassment, according to a press release about her case. Breauna Morrow, a 15-year-old cashier at a McDonald\u2019s in St. Louis, said her supervisors did nothing when she complained of a co-worker who repeatedly sexually harassed her.  McDonald\u2019s advertises all over television saying it\u2019s \u2018America\u2019s best first job,\u2019 but my experience has been a nightmare,  Breauna said in a statement.  I know I\u2019m not the only one and that\u2019s why I\u2019m speaking out, so others don\u2019t have to face the harassment I\u2019ve gone through.  The lawsuits are among the first to arise following the creation of the defense fund in late 2017, amid a wave of sexual misconduct allegations against powerful men in Hollywood, the media and other industries. The Time\u2019s Up Defense Fund, backed in part by A-listers like Reese Witherspoon and Kerry Washington, offers financial backing for workers to effectively challenge sexual harassment.  Sexual harassment takes a devastating toll on the women who endure it,  Sharyn Tejani, director of the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, said on a call with reporters Tuesday.  The fast food industry has an atrocious record on sexual harassment in the workplace,  Tejani said.  No worker at any job ever should have to endure abuse for a paycheck.  Fight for $15, the organization focused on establishing a higher minimum wage for fast-food workers, partnered with Time\u2019s Up on the McDonald\u2019s cases. Fight for $15 announced Tuesday that it has set up a hotline for fast-food workers to have their charges reviewed by lawyers.  The McDonald\u2019s workers are demanding the company enforce the zero tolerance policy against sexual harassment outlined in its manual. They are also calling for mandatory sexual harassment trainings for managers and employees. In a statement to HuffPost, Terri Hickey, a spokeswoman for McDonald\u2019s USA, said the company is  committed to a culture that fosters the respectful treatment of everyone.   There is no place for harassment and discrimination of any kind in our workplace,  Hickey said.  McDonald\u2019s Corporation takes allegations of sexual harassment very seriously and are confident our independent franchisees who own and operate approximately 90 percent of our 14,000 U.S. restaurants will do the same.  The Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund also announced Tuesday its role in a lawsuit filed by Gina Pitre, a former Walmart worker in Mississippi. Pitre alleges that her manager made  unwelcomed sexual comments [and] unwelcomed requests for text pictures  during her time at Walmart, the country\u2019s largest corporate employer of women.  For more than a year, my manager at Walmart repeatedly sexually harassed me while I was on the job,  Pitre said in a statement.  I tried to tell the company what was happening, but Walmart did nothing to hold the harasser accountable or keep me safe.  Randy Hargrove, a spokesman for Walmart, told HuffPost the company had investigated Pitre\u2019s accusations and  could not find sufficient evidence to substantiate a violation of our discrimination and harassment policy.   We take this matter seriously and we will respond appropriately,  Hargrove said. Last week, members of OUR Walmart, an advocacy group for retail workers, sent a letter to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, demanding the company commit to stricter policies on sexual harassment. The letter, signed by several high-profile activists including actress Susan Sarandon, called on Walmart to create a streamlined, transparent process for filing sexual harassment complaints. Hargrove said the company already has  strong policies and procedures in place to address allegations of sexual harassment.   We believe our current practices meet or exceed many of the requests in the letter,  he said.  Like anything at Walmart, we will continue to review our policies and enhance them as appropriate.  Pitre and other OUR Walmart members refuse to back down until they feel meaningful change has taken place.  I\u2019m speaking up for justice for myself and so that no woman has to experience what I went through at Walmart or in any job,  Pitre said in a statement.  Time is up for sexual harassment \u2015 and for companies that won\u2019t take action to protect their employees.  Need help?

            "text": "Starbucks announced a new policy of inclusivity on Saturday that will permit anyone to sit in its cafes or use the stores\u2019 restrooms, regardless of whether they\u2019ve bought anything, The Associated Press reported. The move comes weeks after one of the coffee chain\u2019s stores in Philadelphia incited outrage for calling the police on two black men who had not made a purchase while they waited for a friend to arrive.  We are committed to creating a culture of warmth and belonging where everyone is welcome,  the company said in a statement. Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson were arrested for  trespassing  on April 12 after a Starbucks store manager in Philadelphia called the police. Nelson said he\u2019d asked the manager if he could use the restroom when he arrived in the cafe but was told the facilities were for paying customers only. The men said they\u2019d been waiting for a friend to arrive when the police arrived and they were arrested \u2015 mere minutes after they\u2019d entered the store. Their arrest, captured on camera, quickly became a public relations nightmare for Starbucks. Protests erupted at the Philadelphia store and demonstrators accused the cafe\u2019s staff of racism. The manager no longer works for the company.  The company moved quickly to control the damage. Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson flew to Philadelphia soon after the incident to personally meet with the two men, who later settled with the company for an undisclosed sum and free college tuition for an online program created by Starbucks for its employees. Separately, they got a symbolic $1 each from the city of Philadelphia and a pledge from officials to set up a $200,000 to promote entrepreneurship among high school students. Johnson also announced plans to close more than 8,000 Starbucks stores in the U.S. on May 29 so workers can receive training about racial bias. Starbucks said Saturday that going forward, its employees had been told to  consider anyone who walks into its stores a customer  \u2015 whether or not they buy anything, reported AP. The company noted, however, that law enforcement will be notified if a customer appears to pose a threat to safety. Starbucks founder and chairman Howard Schultz said last week that while the company doesn\u2019t  want to become a public bathroom... we\u2019re going to make the right decision 100 percent of the time and give people the key.   We don\u2019t want anyone at Starbucks to feel as if we are not giving access to you to the bathroom because you are less than. We want you to be more than,  Schultz said during a Thursday discussion at Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank, according to Bloomberg.  "

            "text": " Ladies and gentlemen, please rise for our national anthem.  You\u2019ll hear some version of this announcement at the start of most sporting events, whether they be professional, college or youth-level. The performance of the national anthem is a well-established part of American athletic competitions.  Yet  The Star-Spangled Banner  typically doesn\u2019t make an appearance at many other public gatherings. We don\u2019t sing or listen to it before concerts, Broadway shows, operas or lectures. So why do we do this for sports?  The answer goes back to America\u2019s pastime: baseball. First, of course, the national anthem began as a poem written by Francis Scott Key in September 1814, after he witnessed the British bombardment of Fort McHenry in Maryland during the War of 1812 (which ran until early 1815).  During the 19th century, the poem gained popularity as a song set to the tune of another popular song,  To Anacreon in Heaven.  It was performed at events like parades, military ceremonies, Independence Day festivities and, yes,  occasionally, sporting events. The earliest documented performance of  The Star-Spangled Banner  at a baseball game took place at the Union Baseball and Cricket Grounds in Brooklyn, New York, on May 15, 1862. It was the park\u2019s opening game, and over time, playing the song on the opening day of the baseball season became a more widespread practice. But singing  The Star-Spangled Banner  before every game did not become commonplace until later.  In 1889, Secretary of the Navy Benjamin F. Tracy signed an order directing that  The Star-Spangled Banner  be the official song to accompany any raising of the American flag by the Navy. In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson signed an executive order designating it as the country\u2019s national anthem for patriotic occasions. But that status didn\u2019t become truly official until 1931, when Congress passed a measure that President Herbert Hoover signed into law. Historians typically point to one notable event when tracing the connection between the national anthem and sporting events: Game 1 of the 1918 World Series between the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs. It was the final year of World War I, a time when many professional baseball games featured marching drills, live bands and other patriotic elements. Given the strains of wartime, however, Game 1 was not well-attended, and the mood was reportedly somber.  During the seventh-inning stretch, however, the band lifted spectators\u2019 spirits with a powerful performance of  The Star-Spangled Banner.  The New York Times recounted the moment:  As the crowd of 10,274 spectators \u2014 the smallest that has witnessed the diamond classic in many years \u2014 stood up to take their afternoon yawn, that has been the privilege and custom of baseball fans for many generations, the band broke forth to the strains of  The Star-Spangled Banner.  The performance was so well-received that bands played the song during the subsequent games in the World Series that year. And from then on,  The Star-Spangled Banner  was a regular feature of special baseball occasions like opening day, national holidays and the World Series. During World War II, playing the national anthem before regular baseball games became the norm, thanks to an upswing in patriotic sentiment and technological developments in sound systems that allowed for the playing of the song without the added expense of hiring a band. The practice spread to other sports as well. After the war ended in 1945, NFL Commissioner Elmer Layden stated his intention to make  The Star-Spangled Banner  a permanent part of every football game.   We must not drop it simply because the war is over. We should never forget what it stands for,  Layden declared.  Not everyone in the sports world agreed, however. In 1954, Baltimore Orioles general manager and World War I veteran Arthur Ehlers decided not to play  The Star-Spangled Banner  before each game and opted to save it for special occasions. He said that frequent repetition  tends to cheapen the song and lessen the thrill of response  and complained about fans not behaving respectfully during the anthem.  Under pressure from the public and the Baltimore City Council, Ehlers eventually changed his mind.  The owner of the Chicago Cubs felt similarly and did not include  The Star-Spangled Banner  as a standard element at home games until the 1960s during the Vietnam War. The Chicago White Sox replaced the anthem with  God Bless America  for a time in the \u201960s but then returned to  The Star-Spangled Banner  after fans expressed their preference for it in an official poll.  With its evocations of warfare and patriotism,  The Star-Spangled Banner  has become a seemingly inextricable part of American sports culture \u2015 and even pop culture, thanks to iconic moments like Whitney Houston\u2019s powerful 1991 Super Bowl performance during the Gulf War.   Sports are a kind of bloodless warfare,  Marc Ferris, author of Star-Spangled Banner: The Unlikely Story of America\u2019s National Anthem, told USA Today last year.  A sort of war without death.  Over the years, the anthem has certainly played a part in cultural wars. Most recently, quarterback Colin Kaepernick\u2019s decision to protest racial injustice by kneeling during  The Star-Spangled Banner  has been the subject of heated debate.  In 1968, Olympic athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos were thrown out of Olympic Stadium in Mexico City after raising their fists in a Black Power salute as they stood on the medal podium during  The Star-Spangled Banner.   Beyond political protests, actual musical performances of the anthem have generated controversy. In 1968, singer-songwriter Jos\u00e9 Feliciano kicked off Game 5 of the World Series with a bluesy version of the song, which drew complaints from fans expecting a more traditional rendition. In 1990, comedian Roseanne Barr sang the anthem before a Major League Baseball game. She ended her  screechy, off-key  performance by grabbing her crotch and spitting on the ground. President George H.W. Bush called Barr\u2019s rendition  disgraceful.  And in February of this year, singer Fergie came under fire for her  sexy  performance of the anthem at the NBA All-Star Game. For a song meant to unite the country,  The Star-Spangled Banner  can also be quite divisive \u2015 which perhaps makes it all the more fitting for sports.

For the first time in the Miss America pageant\u2019s history, its leadership teams will be headed by women, all of whom are former pageant winners. The pageant, established in 1921, announced the appointment of two women on Thursday to head its foundation and its day-to-day operations. The announcement follows an email scandal first reported by HuffPost in December that led to the swift resignation of two male leaders. The leaked emails revealed disparaging and misogynistic comments about the pageant\u2019s participants. Regina Hopper, a former Miss Arkansas who previously served as chair of the Miss America Foundation, will now serve as the Miss America Organization\u2019s president and chief executive officer. Marjorie Vincent-Tripp, who won the Miss America title in 1991, will head the foundation\u2019s board of trustees after serving on it in 2016. The pageant\u2019s organization and foundation are separate nonprofits, with the organization overseeing the competition and the foundation processing the recipients\u2019 scholarships, according to the pageant\u2019s website. The appointments follow former Fox News host and Miss America pageant winner Gretchen Carlson becoming the first Miss America to be appointed to lead the organization\u2019s board of trustees in January.  By putting female leadership in place, we hope to send a strong signal,  Hopper told The Associated Press this week.  We want young women to see Miss America as a place where they can come and benefit and be empowered.  Vincent-Tripp, in a statement shared on the pageant\u2019s website, celebrated the appointments as a new chapter.  It is my hope to continue the mission of expanding the reach of the Foundation to provide scholarship opportunities for young women across the board,  she said. Both Hopper and Vincent-Tripp are lawyers and former TV journalists.  The induction of this all-female leadership team signals forthcoming transformational changes to the entire organization and program, ushering in a new era of progressiveness, inclusiveness and empowerment,  the pageant said in a statement.

            "text": "SEATTLE (Reuters) - Seattle\u2019s city council on Monday approved a new tax for the city\u2019s biggest companies, including Amazon.com Inc., to combat a housing crisis attributed in part to a local economic boom that has driven up real estate costs at the expense of the working class. Amazon, the city\u2019s largest employer, said after the vote that it would go ahead with planning for a major downtown office building that it earlier had put on hold over its objections to a much stiffer tax plan originally proposed. As passed on a 9-0 vote after a boisterous public hearing, the measure would apply to most companies grossing at least $20 million a year, levying a tax of roughly 14 cents per employee per hour worked within the city - about $275 annually for each worker. That  head tax  formula is designed to raise $45 million to $49 million a year over the five-year life of the tax - down from an original $75 million annually - to build more affordable housing and support services for the homeless. The tax would end after five years unless renewed by the city. Amazon had led private-sector opposition to the plan, saying earlier this month it was freezing expansion planning for Seattle pending the outcome of Monday\u2019s action. The move by the world\u2019s largest online retailer, owned by billionaire entrepreneur Jeff Bezos, put in question more than 7,000 new jobs. Following the council vote, Amazon\u2019s vice president, Drew Herdener, said the company has resumed construction planning for its so-called Block 18 project in downtown Seattle, following the pause it announced two weeks ago. However, he added,  We remain very apprehensive about the future created by the council\u2019s hostile approach and rhetoric toward larger businesses, which forces us to question our growth here.  Amazon said it is still evaluating whether to sub-lease space in a second future office tower in Seattle, a project called Rainier Square, meaning it may move some planned jobs elsewhere and thus avoid further raising its tax liability. The tax also would hit such Seattle-based stalwarts as coffee retailer Starbucks and department store chain Nordstrom, as well as California-based tech giants like Apple, Google and Facebook that have enough of a presence in Seattle that they would be subject to the new levy. The tax is expected to be borne by about 500 companies, accounting for 3 percent of the city\u2019s private sector. Healthcare companies are exempt, as are non-profits. Sponsors of the tax said Seattle\u2019s biggest-earning businesses should bear some burden for easing a shortage in low-cost housing that they helped create by driving up real estate prices to the point where the working poor and many middle-class families can no longer afford to live in the city. Supporters cite data showing Seattle\u2019s median home prices have soared to $820,000, and more than 41 percent of renters in the city ranked as  rent-burdened,  meaning they pay at least 30 percent of their income on housing. The Seattle metropolitan area also is home to the third-largest concentrations of homeless people, nearly 12,000 counted in a January U.S. government survey, and almost half of them were living on the streets or otherwise unsheltered. Mayor Jenny Durkan, who expressed concern that the original proposal would lead to an economic backlash, said she would sign the new tax ordinance into law. She had offered an amendment to essentially cut the original $75 million tax proposal in half, but her proposal was rejected last Friday. Council members then negotiated over the weekend to craft a compromise that would gain greater support and was certain to win a veto-proof majority. On Monday, about 40 elected officials from across the United States, some representing local governments in the running to host Amazon\u2019s second headquarters, published an open letter to Seattle in support of the head tax and expressing concern that Amazon opposed the measure.  By threatening Seattle over this tax, Amazon is sending a message to all of our cities: we play by our own rules,  the officials wrote. The head tax approved on Monday is not the first. Denver has enacted a similar tax, and Chicago had one but repealed it. Seattle itself had a head tax in effect from 2006 to 2009 but it was repealed to help businesses in the midst of the recession.

            "text": "Uber will no longer force individual victims of sexual harassment or assault into forced arbitration, the ride-hailing company\u2019s chief legal officer Tony West announced in a blog post Tuesday morning.  Riders, drivers or employees who have been sexually assaulted or discriminated against are free to choose the venue they want to pursue their claims against the company, wrote West, who was a top-ranking official in the Justice Department during the Obama administration and has spoken previously about the pervasiveness of sexual harassment and gender discrimination.  It\u2019s important to give sexual assault and harassment survivors control of how they pursue their claims,  West wrote in the post, noting the company\u2019s need to regain the public\u2019s trust.  Whatever they decide, they will be free to tell their story wherever and however they see fit.  The move comes less than three weeks after 14 women, who said they were sexually assaulted by their Uber drivers, penned an open letter to the company\u2019s board urging it to allow them to pursue justice in an open courtroom, rather than in arbitration.  Silencing our stories deprives customers and potential investors from the knowledge that our horrific experiences are part of a widespread problem at Uber,  the women wrote.  This is not doing the \u2018right thing,\u2019  they said, alluding to the company\u2019s new motto:  We do the right thing. Period.  The letter drew widespread media coverage, including over the issue of forced arbitration. The app\u2019s terms of service require any rider with a complaint against the company, even of sexual assault, to commit to arbitration, essentially private courtrooms where a company typically has the edge in any litigation. West, who did a stint at PepsiCo before joining Uber, credits the new motto in his post on Tuesday, explaining that in order to actually do the right thing the company must now act with  transparency, integrity, and accountability.  Victims can now decide whether to pursue their case in open court or through mediation or arbitration, he wrote. And when survivors settle cases with Uber, the company will no longer require them to remain silent about what happened to them as part of the deal, he added.  Uber also said that it would publicly release a safety report that will include data on sexual assaults and other incidents that occur on the Uber platform. The moves are effective immediately, the company said, and apply to all cases currently pending against the company. Those who previously signed non-disclosure agreements will still be bound by those NDAs.  [Uber CEO] Dara [Khosrowshahi] recently said that sexual predators often look for a dark corner,  West wrote.  Our message to the world is that we need to turn the lights on.  One other tech company \u2015 Microsoft \u2015 has gotten rid of forced arbitration in harassment lawsuits. But Uber\u2019s move is sure to affect far more people, as millions use the service each year. On Tuesday afternoon, Uber\u2019s closest competitor, Lyft, followed its lead and made a similar announcement.   Today, 48 hours prior to an impending lawsuit against their company, Uber made the good decision to adjust their policies,  a Lyft spokesperson said in an email to HuffPost.  We agree with the changes.  Lyft said it was ending its forced arbitration policy for sexual assault victims, whether they\u2019re riders, drivers or employees. Like Uber, the company would still force class actions into arbitration. Lyft also said it would no longer require confidentiality in settlement agreements and plans to release data on sexual assaults. The company said it did not have an estimate of how much the change will cost and declined to say how many harassment and discrimination cases it has pending. Uber\u2019s new policy only applies to individual cases. Victims and survivors who wish to band together and bring class action litigation against the company will still be barred from doing so. For its part, Uber contends that the vast majority of the suits filed against it are at the individual level. Other riders with complaints against the company \u2015 outside the realm of harassment and discrimination \u2015 will still be held to the fine print in the app\u2019s terms of service agreement, requiring that disputes be settled via arbitration.  Uber also said it now supports federal legislation that would allow individuals to opt out of arbitration in cases of sexual assault and discrimination. A bipartisan bill like that was introduced earlier this year with the help of Gretchen Carlson, the former Fox News host who was able to sue the company\u2019s chairman and CEO despite an arbitration clause in her contract.   I\u2019m proud to see companies joining our fight to end arbitration to give more women a voice in harassment and assault cases and unveil the secrecy,  Carlson told HuffPost.  I\u2019m hopeful more companies will follow suit.  Earlier this year, Facebook told HuffPost it was considering whether to support that legislation \u2015 and defended its use of arbitration. All 50 state attorneys general have expressed support for the bill, known as the End Arbitration Act for Sexual Harassment. In the meantime, the fate of many of those women\u2019s assault cases is far from clear. Nine of the 14 women who wrote that open letter are currently suing the company and have asked a California court for class-action status for their case. The women will now be free to pursue their assault charges in court, but only on an individual level. They\u2019re also suing Uber for misleading advertising and fraud \u2015 and the company said those claims would still have to be arbitrated.  Our hope is that Uber ending forced arbitration for victims of sexual assault will begin a process to reduce future suffering by women passengers,  Jean Christensen, the lawyer representing the nine victims.  Uber has made a critical step in this direction, but preventing victims from proceeding together, on a class basis, shows that Uber is not fully committed to meaningful change.  Victims are more likely to come forward knowing they can proceed as a group.  This is the beginning of a longer process needed to meaningfully improve safety.  Moving to disclose data on rapes and sexual assaults is risky for the company, West acknowledged in an interview with The New York Times. He said he struggled with the decision because he knows it will be  disturbing,  according to the Times. Uber is a large company and it\u2019s fairly easy to lodge a complaint against it. Also, there\u2019s no standard on how to report such incidents, the company noted. Uber still hasn\u2019t made one key demand: Tightening its driver background checks by running fingerprints through FBI and DOJ databases.  Uber has  so much money that they are willing to allow customers to sue them in court for what happens to them, but they are not willing to make the changes which would make the customers safe,  said Christensen. Uber disputes the usefulness of fingerprint checks and has pointed out that it has made a raft of changes to tighten up safety over the past year. Uber also said it will continue to force other disputes into arbitration, including when a passenger is injured due to driver negligence. Uber\u2019s reputation took a serious hit in the last several years after a series of public gaffes, reports of sexual assaults by drivers that were mishandled and a sexual harassment scandal that felled Uber\u2019s co-founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick.  In light of the numerous high-profile sexual harassment and assault cases across industries in recent months, West\u2019s post also references the Me Too movement and Time\u2019s Up, the coalition of women in Hollywood formed to fight sexual harassment. Uber announced that it created its new policy by consulting with women\u2019s groups and advisers including Tina Tchen, Michelle Obama\u2019s former chief-of-staff and one of the founders of the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund. This article has been updated to include additional comments from Lyft, Christensen and Carlson. "

Stewart, who is a member of the film festival\u2019s jury this year, posed for photographers while wearing a pair of Christian Louboutin stilettos. The actress then swiftly removed her shoes and walked the rest of the red carpet barefoot on her way to a screening of Spike Lee\u2019s film  BlacKkKlansman.  Stewart has not said whether she removed her shoes to protest the French festival\u2019s rule requiring women to don high heels, and her representatives did not return HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. But the star has spoken out in the past against what many consider an arcane dress code. At the 2016 festival, Stewart told Vanity Fair that the policy needed to change immediately.   If [a man and I] were walking the red carpet together and someone stopped me and said, \u2018Excuse me, young lady, you\u2019re not wearing heels. You cannot come in,\u2019 then [I\u2019m going to say], \u2018Neither is my friend. Does he have to wear heels?\u2019  she said at the time.  It can work both ways. It\u2019s just like you simply cannot ask me to do something that you are not asking him. I get the black-tie thing but you should be able to do either version \u2014 flats or heels.  That same year, Julia Roberts went barefoot on the Cannes red carpet. The high-profile rebellions against the dress code seem to stem from a 2015 incident when middle-aged women wearing rhinestone flats were turned away from a screening of the film  Carol.  The festival cited the  obligatory heels  policy in response to the outrage. "

Beitar declared in a Facebook post that it was making the move to honor President Donald Trump for recognizing Jerusalem as the capital city and moving the U.S. embassy there. The embassy was scheduled to open Monday, sparking fierce protests. Previous U.S. administrations have kept the embassy in Tel Aviv in an attempt to keep peace efforts percolating, but Trump\u2019s shift has stirred resentment among Palestinians who hope to establish their own future capital in east Jerusalem.  The chairmen of the club, the owner Eli Tabib and the executive manager Eli Ohana have decided to add to the club\u2019s title the name of the American President who made history, and from now on will be called Beitar Trump Jerusalem. We have the greatest love for the president, and we will win,  the team\u2019s statement said, per The Jerusalem Post.  For 70 years, Jerusalem has been awaiting international recognition, until President Donald Trump, in a courageous move, recognized Jerusalem as the eternal capital of Israel. President Trump has shown courage and true love of the Israeli people and their capital, and these days other countries are following his lead in giving Jerusalem its rightful status.  The six-time league champion team has been penalized before because some fans have chanted anti-Arab and Muslim slogans during matches, CNN pointed out.

            "text": "Organizers of the prestigious Cannes Film Festival on Monday signed a pledge committing to policies promoting more gender parity, in response to activism from women in the film industry.  The world is no longer the same. We must examine our own practices, our habits and our history,  said festival head Thierry Fremaux, who has faced criticism for the annual event\u2019s inclusion of an abysmally low number of female-directed movies. The adoption of the pledge on Monday came two days after a powerful protest organized by a group of French filmmakers pushing for gender equality, 5050 by 2020. Hollywood\u2019s Times Up movement against workplace sexual harassment also advocated the commitment. The demonstration featured 82 women, led by the Cannes festival\u2019s jury president, actress Cate Blanchett. They marched along the festival\u2019s red carpet on Saturday night, symbolizing the number of movies directed or co-directed by women that have competed in the festival\u2019s main slate throughout its entire history. Since the festival began in 1946, 1,645 movies directed by men have been featured, according to data compiled by 5050 by 2020. Some of the movies were co-directed by multiple men, amounting to 1,688 male directors. The festival\u2019s gender equity pledge has three main components, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Festival organizers will release statistics on the gender breakdown of film submissions, be transparent about members of the festival\u2019s selection and programming committees, and will establish equal gender representation on the festival\u2019s executive board. The pledge also encourages festival organizers to develop goals  to achieve perfect parity.   While modest and incremental, the pledge could encourage larger, long-term changes, as film festivals like Cannes play an important role in championing emerging filmmakers and showcasing movies that go on to receive critical acclaim and awards recognition. Organizers of the pledge hope that other prominent film festivals adopt similar commitments. Leaders of this fall\u2019s Toronto Film Festival, which often marks the unofficial start of the movie awards season, have also promised to sign the pledge. CORRECTION: An earlier version misstated the number of films directed by men. "

A badly beaten Raquel Pennington can be hard telling handlers in her corner  I\u2019m done  and  I want to be done  after the fourth round of her bantamweight bout against Nunes in Rio de Janeiro on Saturday night. But the handlers appear to disregard her plea to throw in the towel.  No, no, no,  a coach can be heard saying. Then Pennington is told,  We\u2019ll recover later.  Pennington answered the bell for the fifth round, absorbing a flurry of punches before the referee stopped the match.  Check out the highlights beginning at 1:20 into the clip.  If she didn\u2019t have the right conditioning to fight, then the coach should have thrown in the towel for sure,  a triumphant Nunes said, per MMA Junkie.  I think my coach wouldn\u2019t let me go through that. It\u2019s sad. Everyone must be saying a lot of bad things about him on social media, but I really think she needs to surround herself with people who want the best for her so she can really evolve for her next fights. Unfortunately, tonight (the cornerman) failed.  The decision sparked online debate, but Pennington\u2019s fiancee, Tecia Torres, defended the move in an Instagram post.  Both us and our coaches agree with the decision made to go into the 5th round,  Torres wrote.  We know Raquel more than anyone else and know if we let her give up on herself going into the last round she would have always regretted it. She fought with heart and grit until the end.  UFC President Dana White did not immediately respond to a HuffPost request for comment. "

            "text": "Leaders in the Southern Baptist Convention are seeking to clear the air as a prominent Baptist\u2019s past remarks about women, abuse, and divorce come newly under scrutiny. Paige Patterson, president of Texas\u2019 Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and a major figure in America\u2019s largest Protestant denomination, admitted Thursday that his description of a teenage girl\u2019s body as  nice  in recently resurfaced footage of a 2014 sermon had  obviously been hurtful to women.   I wish to apologize to every woman who has been wounded by anything I have said that was inappropriate or that lacked clarity,  Patterson wrote in a statement on his seminary\u2019s website. In his 2014 talk, Patterson appeared to condone the objectification of a 16-year-old girl\u2019s body. To illustrate how God  beautifully and artistically  created women, he recalled a time when he saw  a very attractive  16-year-old walking by after he\u2019d preached at an event.  She was nice,  Patterson reminisced in the clip, remarking that another man had described her as  built.  On Thursday, Patterson apologized for his words.   Please forgive the failure to be as thoughtful and careful in my extemporaneous expression as I should have been,  the pastor wrote in his statement. Patterson\u2019s apology did not directly address another remark he\u2019s made that has been causing controversy within Southern Baptist circles. He was captured on tape in 2000 advising physically abused wives to avoid divorce whenever possible and to  be submissive in every way.  He\u2019s clarified since that he has counseled women to leave \u2015 albeit not to divorce \u2015 their abusive husbands.  In his apology, Patterson did not address the possibility of divorce as an option for women in abusive relationships. He did, however, explicitly condemn all forms of abuse.  I utterly reject any form of abuse in demeaning or threatening talk, in physical blows, or in forced sexual acts,  he wrote in his statement on Thursday.  There is no excuse for anyone to use intemperate language or to attempt to injure another person.  Patterson\u2019s earlier statements have caused some division within the denomination in recent weeks. Patterson is a prominent figure within the church. As a former president of the entire denomination, he\u2019s credited with leading it toward greater conservatism. Some Southern Baptists are calling for Patterson to resign from his seminary position and withdraw from other duties, such as delivering the sermon at the denomination\u2019s annual meeting in Dallas this June. A petition condemning Patterson\u2019s  damaging, sinful  comments has gathered over 3,000 signatures, mostly from evangelical women. Others are offering their support for Patterson. Female professors and students at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary say he has been a champion for women at their school.  Samuel Schmidt, a pastor from Kentucky and a graduate of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, has organized a petition to defend Patterson. He claims the leader is being targeted by a  witch-hunt  carried out by  culture warriors, for the sake of political correctness at the expense of the glory of the Gospel.  His letter supporting Patterson has gained over 450 signatures. Amid the tension, Steve Gaines, current president of the Southern Baptist Convention, released a statement on Friday about Patterson. Gaines said he disagreed with the advice Patterson gave abused women (although he also did not address the possibility of divorce). Gaines also said he felt Patterson\u2019s remarks about the teenage girl\u2019s body were  improper.  He asked for forgiveness from women who have been hurt by Patterson\u2019s comments and called on all Southern Baptists to pray for the church. He encouraged them to speak  positively and constructively  about the issue online.  Every word we speak, in private or public conversation, even on social media, should be Christlike and filled with grace,  Gaines wrote in his statement.  Far better to be wronged than to participate in an ungodly exchange of words before a lost world that is listening and watching.  Karen Swallow Prior, a professor of English at the evangelical Christian Liberty University, was one of the Southern Baptist women who signed the petition denouncing Patterson\u2019s past remarks. She told HuffPost that Patterson\u2019s apology appeared to be a step in the right direction. However, she said, repentance is shown  not through words, but through actions.  Prior said she is waiting to see whether Patterson\u2019s seminary will take a stand on the issue. The seminary\u2019s board of trustees is scheduled to meet on May 22 in light of recent events.  This situation is not just about one man. The power of this one man depends upon the support of many men,  Prior wrote in an email.  The leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention are at a crossroads. The way they deal with this situation going forward will proclaim to the church and the world how they think women should be treated.  "

            "text": "Sophia started using Uber soon after it was founded in 2009. She doesn\u2019t even remember agreeing to, much less reading, the fine print in the app\u2019s terms of service. This would only become important in hindsight. Last December, the 26-year-old San Francisco Bay Area native took her final Uber ride. It should\u2019ve been a forgettable 12-minute trip from her company\u2019s holiday party to her home, but it turned into something terrible. When the car pulled up in front of her apartment building, Sophia\u2019s driver asked if he could walk her inside. She said no. Then, just as she was keying in the code to open the front door, he snuck up behind her, pushing her into the foyer. He grabbed her up into a bear hug and groped her. She got away, briefly, fleeing up the stairs to her apartment. He followed. In front of her apartment door, he again squeezed her tightly, putting his hand up her dress. Luckily, she made it inside her apartment and locked him out.  Later, after reporting her assault to the police, Sophia learned that her driver was a registered sex offender. How could Uber have allowed this man to drive for the company? she wondered. Sophia, who does not want to publicly reveal her last name, is one of nine women suing Uber for fraud, misleading advertising about its level of safety, and assault, battery and rape. The women are demanding that the ride-sharing company truly reckon with what they say is a widespread sexual assault issue.  The details of Sophia\u2019s attack are documented in the lawsuit, where she is identified as Jane Doe #3. The case was filed in 2017 and updated in March when Sophia and six other women joined the suit.  While a few of the other women suing have shared their stories publicly, Sophia is only now coming forward to HuffPost to share her experiences. The women want Uber to fix what they see as its  flawed  background check system, the lawsuit says. Because the system is designed to quickly approve drivers, Uber skips steps that would screen out sex offenders like the one who assaulted Sophia, according to the suit. Though Uber has recently announced changes to its system, these women say they\u2019re insufficient. The women say the only way they can force Uber to improve its standards is if they bring their case into a public courtroom \u2015 and this highlights a second, possibly even larger issue with Uber: When users download the app, they unwittingly click away their right to file a lawsuit against the company. Uber\u2019s terms of service, which, let\u2019s admit, most people don\u2019t read, require all customers to settle disputes \u2015 even over sexual assault and rape \u2015 in arbitration. These are private courtrooms, outside the public justice system, that notoriously favor big companies.  Uber has already filed a motion in court arguing that these women have no right to make their case in a public courtroom. That spurred action from the nine women and a few others, who penned an open letter to the company\u2019s board of directors urging Uber to reconsider.   Secret arbitration takes away a woman\u2019s right to a trial by a jury of her peers and provides a dark alley for Uber to hide from the justice system, the media and public scrutiny,  the women wrote. Uber defended its use of arbitration in a statement in March when the case expanded, but has since changed its tune somewhat. During a Twitter exchange with Susan Fowler, a former Uber employee who famously shared her story of workplace sexual harassment and discrimination, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said he would look at the issue.  Sexual assault has no place anywhere and we are committed to doing our part to help end this violence,  the company told HuffPost in a statement.  As we prioritize safety at Uber, we are taking a hard look at these important issues.  In arbitration, each woman would have to fight her case alone, on an individual level. The best outcome would be, maybe, a cash settlement. Often, such settlements are kept private through nondisclosure agreements, so other assault victims wouldn\u2019t learn about women who\u2019ve gone through similar experiences. The chances that the company would be forced to re-examine the way it does business are nil. Sophia told HuffPost she\u2019s not doing this for money, but to effect change.  The only thing I can really do is help others,  she said.  I think it\u2019s stronger to join others so we can help others not have this happen to them.  Publicly embarrassed by the letter \u2015 with Khosrowshahi getting called out on Twitter \u2015 the company asked for more time from the court to consider the women\u2019s plea. Uber now has a court-sanctioned deadline of May 17 to formally decide if its sexual assault issues get a public airing out. At a time when women are increasingly unwilling to stay silent about sexual abuse, the idea that a company can keep its problems private through arbitration has become harder to defend.  There are bills at both the federal and state level to stop companies from forcing women into arbitration in sexual harassment and assault cases. Microsoft announced earlier this year that it would no longer force harassment cases filed by its employees into arbitration. Orrick, a major law firm, made a similar announcement in March. Uber has said it has no issue with these women telling their stories in public. But news stories alone can\u2019t always bring justice or closure to victims. There\u2019s a particular power in letting rape survivors bring their stories into a public courtroom \u2015 and to have other women join them and say  me too.  Anyone who watched the victims of Larry Nassar confront their disgraced abuser in a Michigan courtroom in January knows this. We saw the power of a public trial again in the Bill Cosby case.   Having public disclosure in a courtroom about what happened, that\u2019s part of the public record. There\u2019s a real power in that,  said Hannah Brenner, a professor at California Western School of Law who researches the intersection of law and gender, focusing specifically on sexual assault, institutions and disparate power dynamics.  That these women have banded together is particularly powerful.  There\u2019s a tendency for us to dismiss sexual violence as a one-off,  Brenner said. Collectively, these women are a force more difficult to ignore. Citing hundreds of media reports about Uber-related sexual assault, the women suing the company say it has a systemic problem on its hands.  Jeanne Christensen, the lawyer representing the nine women, has been representing rape and assault victims in cases against Uber since at least 2014. She\u2019s negotiated privately with Uber, case by case, but said that last year she grew fed up with the one-off system and became determined to push the company to do more.  The stories are always the same,  she told HuffPost. Christensen\u2019s clients typically said they hailed an Uber ride after a night of drinking, and that their driver then assaulted and, in some cases, raped them. She couldn\u2019t go into more detail, citing confidentiality. Many of her clients are living in fear, she said, afraid their attacker will come after them again.  It\u2019s very common for clients to move apartments. They break leases. That\u2019s how frightened they are,  she said.  They get new phones, change their numbers.  Yet it\u2019s hard to know the real scope of Uber\u2019s sexual assault problems. The company does not release information about reported incidents, police departments don\u2019t track rape data that way \u2015 and sadly, most women do not report sexual assault to anyone at all. The company said it is looking at ways to better track assaults. While rapes and assaults that take place in Uber cars do get a lot of media attention, they are just a small percentage of sexual assaults in the U.S. Strangers aren\u2019t the biggest danger when it comes to rape.  While the Uber assaults are scary, women are still most at risk of being assaulted by someone they know,  said Melissa Morabito, a professor at the School of Criminology and Justice Studies, Center for Women & Work, at the University of Massachusetts Lowell.  Earlier this spring, Uber announced a host of changes meant to strengthen its background check process for drivers, as well as several new safety features. And Khosrowshahi has said publicly that safety is his No. 1 priority. The Uber app will now be better integrated with 911, making it easier for emergency services to find you on the road. The company said it would re-run background checks on all drivers each year to make sure no new incidents have cropped up \u2015 something it did inconsistently in the past. Uber also said it would begin using a technology that would alert them when Uber drivers were arrested in real time. The company  offers features that ensure every trip is GPS tracked, 24/7 response from our safety team, and the ability to share your trip with loved ones in real time, and we\u2019re committed to doing more,  it said in a statement. Uber also announced it was bringing on former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson as chairman of Uber\u2019s safety advisory board. But Christensen says these moves are not enough. Uber\u2019s checking process isn\u2019t much different than the credit check you\u2019d have to go through if you were trying to rent an apartment, she told HuffPost. The check only goes back seven years, according to the women\u2019s lawsuit. (Uber says that its checks can extend beyond that period depending on the database the company is searching.) The company needs to run driver\u2019s fingerprints through the FBI and Department of Justice\u2019s databases, the suit says.  Uber says that the fingerprint system is not a panacea and comes with its own set of flaws. There are concerns, for example, that some people \u2015 who haven\u2019t been convicted or who\u2019ve had their charges dismissed \u2015 get inaccurately labeled as criminals. The company cites data that show hundreds of thousands of Americans can\u2019t get jobs because of flaws and inaccuracies in the system. Uber argues that  While no background check is perfect, our process is robust, fair and relevant to the work at hand.   The predominance of regulators believe that our screening processes are appropriate,  Khosrowshahi told The Washington Post recently.  I don\u2019t think fingerprints would substantially change what happens with human behavior. \u2026 The predators in life look for dark corners. Our job is to tell the world that Uber has its lights on.   Sexual assault is about a predator stealing a part of you that you will never get back. I fight unceasingly against the shame, the loss of feeling safe, and the debilitating anxiety,  Sophia wrote in a statement she shared with HuffPost (read it in full below).  If Uber had done their due diligence, my devastation could have been avoided.  For now, Sophia is trying to find another place to live. She will only stay the night at home if her roommates are around, she said. She fears that the Uber driver who assaulted her might come look for her again.  Sophia fought her attacker off that December night in a struggle that lasted minutes, but that she said felt infinite.  I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever been in a car accident where time is moving extremely slow. You\u2019re trying to make the best decisions you possibly can, but if you\u2019re in the state too long, your brain can\u2019t handle it,  Sophia told HuffPost.  You\u2019re in a constant state of panic. It\u2019s like going in and out of consciousness.  She said she punched the Uber driver in the stomach and ran into her apartment, locking the door and windows. The morning after the attack, she opened her Uber app and reported the incident.  I think I was still in shock. I didn\u2019t think about the right way to do this,  Sophia said. She figured since she had a problem with the service, she should start there.  It seemed like the right move. Very quickly I realized it was not the right move.  A customer service rep called Sophia back and she told the woman what happened.  She said she\u2019d reimburse me for the ride and that they take this seriously and she\u2019d follow up again soon. It was a very short call,  Sophia said, estimating that the conversation probably took less than five minutes. The representative wasn\u2019t particularly empathetic. Sophia compared her demeanor to that of a barista taking your coffee order.  My $17 back was just not what I was going for. It didn\u2019t make me feel safer; that was the main thing,  she said.  I didn\u2019t feel any safer, and it was a pointless call.  Sophia walked to her local police department after that. The cops talked to her for hours, she said. Uber eventually got back to her and told her that her driver was no longer working for the company and that he\u2019d been warned by the police not to come near her.  I don\u2019t know what happened to him,  she said. The company didn\u2019t respond to specific questions about Sophia\u2019s allegations. Sophia doesn\u2019t use the Uber app anymore, but said that living in San Francisco, it\u2019s impossible not to be reminded of the service every day.  Every time I have a noxious reaction,  she said, adding that she now feels like she had blinders on when it came to using the app. She figured Uber was a strong business and had naturally figured this safety thing out, she said.   I got a little bit fooled by that. I didn\u2019t think enough through about what they were doing. I don\u2019t think they did either.   Read Sophia\u2019s full statement below. Sexual Assault is about a predator stealing a part of you that you will never get back. There is no settlement amount or number of criminal convictions that can replace what has forever been lost. To me, this is the most painful aspect of being a sexual assault survivor. I\u2019ve been given a life-sentence of battling the excruciating psychological effects of being violated; I fight unceasingly against the shame, the loss of feeling safe, and the debilitating anxiety. While I am strong and resilient, while I do not want to victimize myself, I want to be transparent and honest about the reality of surviving trauma, as I do not know how else to protect others. This story has been updated to include more information from Uber on how far back its driver background checks extend. Need help?

            "text": "SEATTLE \u2015 The 9:30 a.m. meeting of the Seattle City Council\u2019s Finance and Neighborhoods Committee \u2015 the most boring name imaginable \u2015 was overflowing. People in the crowd held up signs:  Don\u2019t vote our jobs away  or  Tax the rich.  The committee was taking public comment on the proposed Progressive Tax on Business, a fee on Seattle\u2019s largest corporations to support homeless services. Last week, Amazon \u2014 the employer of more than 45,000 Seattleites that is on the hook for an estimated $20 million under the tax \u2014 announced it was pausing construction planning on a tower downtown and would consider renting some of its office space to other companies if the fee goes through. Now the mayor and City Council have to decide whether to take this threat seriously. About a third of the attendees at Wednesday\u2019s hearing were wearing construction vests. One of them told committee members that if the tax passes, workers will have to go home, look their kids in the eye and tell them Daddy doesn\u2019t have a job anymore. Another called a member of the City Council a communist (she\u2019s actually a socialist) and said she  seems to be getting paid by the residents of Seattle to throw temper tantrums.   The applause in the room was deafening.  But the fight is about more than just one company or one policy. It is about the growing challenge of running American cities and all the ways companies make it even harder. Seattle faces an impossible choice: Either raise revenue from employers and risk driving them away, or keep levying taxes on voters and risk a backlash that could exacerbate the very problem it\u2019s trying to solve. Whatever happens here, it will be a template for the rest of the country.  The details of Seattle\u2019s proposed tax are crucial to understanding why Amazon hates it so much. Under the current proposal, the city will charge large companies 26 cents for every hour their employees work. That\u2019s about $520 per worker every year. Though the tax will apply only to companies with more than $20 million in revenue per year, or about 3 percent of Seattle businesses, Amazon employs about 145,000 people. And that structure is only temporary. The tax is flat for the first three years: The same fee is levied on wages whether an employee earns $31,200 a year (the minimum wage here) or more than $100,000 (what many Amazon corporate employees make). But in 2021, the flat fee becomes a payroll tax. Large companies will have to pay 0.7 percent of their employees\u2019 wages \u2014 that\u2019s $220 per year for minimum wage workers and more than $700 for Amazon\u2019s corporate employees. It\u2019s the second part, bigger taxes for bigger incomes, that seems to worry the companies here. A few days after Amazon\u2019s announcement, the CEO of Seattle-based Zillow made the same taking-our-ball-and-going-home threat, calling the tax  misguided and too blunt of an instrument.   But you can\u2019t talk about where the money comes from without talking about where it\u2019s going. Homelessness is an emergency in Seattle. Literally. In 2015, the mayor issued an emergency proclamation over the sheer number of people sleeping outside and in their cars and overflowing from shelters. At last count, Seattle had 11,643 homeless people, and its home of King County had the third-highest homeless concentration in the nation. A study last year by Zillow estimated that every 5 percent rise in Seattle rents pushed 258 more people into homelessness. Rents here rose 13.5 percent last year alone.  The proposed tax would raise about $75 million per year to help address this crisis, bringing the city\u2019s total homelessness budget up to $200 million. Three-quarters of the revenue would go toward building affordable housing and a smaller chunk would go toward direct, immediate services \u2014 things like temporary shelters,  hygiene centers  and shelter beds.   This isn\u2019t about Amazon,  said Lisa Herbold, a Seattle City Council member and a co-sponsor of the tax.  It\u2019s about the humanitarian crisis in our city.  It\u2019s clear that Seattle\u2019s tax is going to piss off Amazon. The question is, how much? Everything the company has said so far has been pretty tepid. Amazon has not, in fact, stopped construction on any downtown towers. It has stopped planning future construction, a much different (and less costly) decision. Similarly, the company announced it was exploring the option of subleasing some floors in one of its already-under-construction office buildings. That doesn\u2019t mean Amazon is crying wolf, but it does mean there\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty about the company\u2019s response. Even if members of the Seattle City Council approve the tax \u2014 hell, even if they triple it \u2014 Washington is still a relatively cheap place to do business. It has no income tax (which is effectively a pay raise for Amazon employees who move here from elsewhere), no capital gains tax and no corporate income tax. The city even passed an almost identical tax on employees, albeit at a much lower rate, in 2006 before repealing it during the recession.  Then there\u2019s the public relations aspect to consider. Though it will grow after 2021, Amazon\u2019s tax bill under the law will be pocket change compared with its $1.6 billion in profits last quarter alone. Moving employees, halting construction and reversing course all have costs, too.  Plus, does a not-super-popular corporate behemoth really want to pull thousands of jobs out of a city over being asked to fund services for the homeless? While Amazon is less reputation-conscious and less likely to be harmed by a boycott than a lot of companies are, its executives must know that throwing a hissy fit over this law would create some backlash. Amazon could still pull jobs out of Seattle anyway. The only thing CEO Jeff Bezos loves more than expanding his company is hating taxes. When a handful of states tried passing laws requiring internet retailers to collect sales tax in 2012, his vice president for global public policy called the efforts  unconstitutional.   A few years ago, Amazon halted plans to build a warehouse in South Carolina when local lawmakers wouldn\u2019t grant an exemption to the state sales tax. Bezos even reportedly considered incorporating his company on a Native American reservation to avoid taxes. Just because leaving Seattle over a small tax increase would be bananas doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t happen. In the past five years, Seattle has seen unprecedented growth, much of it driven by Amazon and other large companies. That has put unbearable strain on the housing market, schools and infrastructure. As the bill for services has grown, the way the city pays for them has become increasingly unjust. Washington has the most regressive tax structure in the country. The poorest 20 percent of residents pay an average of 16.8 percent of their income in state taxes. The richest 1 percent pay just 2.4 percent. This means low-income people are effectively paying for the city\u2019s growth. And yet, nearly every route to fixing Seattle\u2019s tax and revenue mess is blocked. The most obvious fix, an income tax, is illegal under the state constitution (or at least the way the state Supreme Court interpreted the constitution in 1951). Last year, the City Council passed a  high earners tax,  but a lawsuit preventing its implementation was filed about 10 minutes later. Alongside the (high and regressive) sales tax, Seattle relies heavily on property taxes. But, thanks to a 2001 ballot initiative, those revenues aren\u2019t allowed to grow by more than 1 percent per year. Everything the city needs (libraries, fire stations, schools) has to be individually approved by voters. Though Seattle\u2019s property taxes are below average compared with other cities, the constant levies and add-ons contribute to a sense among Seattleites that the city is squeezing them for more money every year without keeping up its end of the bargain. Homelessness is the perfect encapsulation of this dynamic. As the city has grown, it\u2019s nearly doubled its budget for homeless services. In 2016, voters approved a $290 million affordable housing levy. The city is getting more people into permanent housing than ever before.  But living here, it is immediately and viscerally clear that these efforts aren\u2019t enough. Rising rents are pushing people onto the streets faster than the city can bring them back inside. Nearly half of the city\u2019s homeless population is now unsheltered. Last year, a record 169 people died sleeping on the street, and the city is already on track to break the record again.   Seattle\u2019s current situation exposes a fundamental challenge for lawmakers across the country: Solving big problems requires bold, transformational policies. What city leaders can pass in the face of structural barriers and skeptical voters, however, are merely small, incremental improvements to the status quo. And that\u2019s exactly what the Progressive Tax on Business is: a half-measure. No matter what Amazon decides to do, taxing employment, just like taxing cigarette purchases, will result in less of it. And the new tax probably won\u2019t result in a significant reduction in the city\u2019s homeless population. The city estimates the tax will produce 1,780 units of affordable housing, even though its own resolution says it needs more than 17,000.  None of that is an argument against the tax. As council member Herbold points out, this may be Seattle\u2019s only available route toward making its tax code more progressive. Despite the fireworks at public hearings, the tax is relatively modest and is specifically tailored to affect only the companies that can afford it. Nor is it the only tax of its kind: Wilmington, Delaware; Denver; and plenty of other cities tax companies on the number of employees they have, a so-called head tax.  This week, as Seattle debated the $75 million head tax, the Chamber of Commerce released a report estimating that solving homelessness would cost $400 million. A proposal by the mayor to reduce the revenue to $40 million triggered an even more raucous committee hearing, with protesters chanting  $75 million, no extortion!  to another packed audience. The original proposal passed and will be voted on Monday, but the mayor could still veto it.  But that is the debate here, what has become possible and necessary to the city to fight over: Whether to spend 10 percent of what it will cost to solve homelessness or 20 percent.  But the bigger question is how cities should respond to threats like Amazon\u2019s.  The request for proposals for the company\u2019s second headquarters stated explicitly that  a stable and business-friendly environment and tax structure will be high-priority considerations.  Cities responded in kind: Chula Vista, California, offered free land. Fresno, California, offered control over how municipal revenues would be spent. Chicago even offered to waive income taxes for Amazon employees.  The calculation these cities are making is all about the multiplier: Every job created by Amazon creates another 1.5 in  indirect employment  \u2014 consultants, chefs, schoolteachers. Except those employers won\u2019t get any of the tax breaks. Perversely, it\u2019s only the largest companies, the ones with the most power and the littlest need for unfair advantages, who get cities falling all over themselves to give away revenues.  It\u2019s not even clear what Seattle gave up to entice Amazon\u2019s most recent expansion here. The company didn\u2019t respond to inquiries about how many employees it has in Seattle or how much it pays in city and state taxes (though late last week,  a person at the company familiar with the data  made a  rare disclosure  to The Seattle Times that Amazon had paid $250 million in local taxes \u2014 without specifying what types of taxes or where they went). No matter where they operate, companies have every incentive to play exactly the game Amazon is playing. To shareholders, every dollar a company pays in tax is waste. The minute Amazon announces its second headquarters location, it can start pitting its host cities against each other: Hey Seattle, we\u2019re thinking of adding another 1,000 jobs. It\u2019s you or Pittsburgh. What are you going to give us? This is, in fact, almost exactly what the CEO of Zillow warned this week.  We are actively trying to decide where to put the next couple hundred heads, and this is the type of thing that causes us to consider looking at putting that expansion in other cities,  he said. The challenge of finding enough revenue to adequately run a city is only going to get worse. Excluding health care, federal grants to cities are at their lowest since 1980. Despite the growing economy, 30 states have revenue shortfalls. The Trump administration has declared its intention to cut transportation funding and housing assistance. Without outside support, cities will become increasingly reliant on revenues from their own voters and their largest employers.  Seattle is a case study for what those fights are going to look like. The more desperate cities become, the more leverage corporations will wield over them. And, simultaneously, the more frustrated their populations will get at the constant tax raises and fee hikes.  The most depressingly insightful comment from Wednesday\u2019s City Council hearing came from Howard Bess, a counselor for the Downtown Emergency Service Center, a homeless shelter in Seattle. He apologized for being tired; he had been up all night helping Seattle\u2019s homeless population find an  island of relief.   I don\u2019t see that anybody who is opposing this is going to die on the streets,  he said,  or not be able to pay their mortgage or not be able to wear new shoes or clean clothes. But our clients could certainly use that help.   The applause for him was even louder.  "

            "text": "Eighty-two women including Cate Blanchett and Ava DuVernay marched up the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival on Saturday to protest gender inequality at the festival and in the wider film industry. Members of the group included actresses, directors and other women in the film industry, including Kristen Stewart, Salma Hayek and  Wonder Woman  director Patty Jenkins, The Associated Press reports. Blanchett, the jury president of this year\u2019s festival, led the group and read out a statement from the steps of the Palais des Festivals, joined by French film director Agnes Varda, who read the statement in French. In her remarks, Blanchett explained the significance of the number 82.  On these steps today stand 82 women representing the number of female directors who have climbed these stairs since the first edition of the Cannes Film Festival in 1946,  she said, according to The Hollywood Reporter.  In the same period 1688 male directors have climbed these very same stairs. In the 71 years of this world-renowned festival there have been 12 female heads of its juries.  She added that 71 male directors have received the Palme d\u2019Or, the most prestigious award of the festival. Only one female director, Jane Campion in 1993, has received the Palme d\u2019Or, though Varda won an honorary Palme d\u2019Or in 2015.  Women are not a minority in the world, yet the current state of the industry says otherwise,  Blanchett said.  We stand together on these steps today as a symbol of our determination to change and progress.  The march was planned by 5050 by 2020, a French movement dedicated to gender equality in film. The statement coincides with the Cannes Film Festival\u2019s announcement that it will be signing  concrete, strong commitments  to diversity on Monday, Deadline reports, though it\u2019s not clear what exactly those commitments will be.

            "text": "Cornell University student Letitia Chai stripped down to her underwear while delivering a presentation this week after a professor reportedly told her that her shorts were  too short  just days earlier. About two dozen of Chai\u2019s fellow students joined in.  This topic transcends all of our social identities and taps right into the heart of who we are,  Chai, a fourth-year student, said to a room of nearly 50 people while presenting her thesis paper on May 5, as seen in a livestream of the event. Chai began undressing as she held back tears, first removing her shoes, then her pants and, lastly, her shirt.  I am more than Asian. I am more than a woman. I am more than Letitia Chai. I am a human being,  she said while undressing.  And I ask you to take this leap of faith, to take this next step, or rather this next strip, in our movement and to join me in revealing to each other and to seeing each other for who we truly are \u2014 members of the human race.   Then 28 of the 44 people in the room also took off their clothes, The Cornell Sun reported. Although Chai\u2019s protest happened last week, her story didn\u2019t hit national news until Thursday.   The protest came just days after Chai was presenting a trial run of her thesis in her class  Acting in Public: Performance in Everyday Life  on May 2. When Chai went to give her trial run presentation, professor Rebekah Maggor questioned the student\u2019s outfit choice.    Is that really what you would wear?  Maggor asked Chai, according to a Facebook post the student wrote later that day. Chai, who was wearing a long-sleeve button-down shirt and jean cutoff shorts, said she was  shook  by Maggor\u2019s alleged comments.   The professor proceeded to tell me, in front of my whole class, that I was inviting the male gaze away from the content of my presentation and onto my body,  she wrote on Facebook, noting that her professor is a white woman.  She said I was making a statement by wearing my outfit. I told her that I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t change my statement to make her or anyone else feel more comfortable.  According to Chai, a male international student then made a comment that a presenter has a  moral obligation  to the audience to dress conservatively, at which point Chai fled the room in tears.   I am not responsible for anyone\u2019s attention because we are capable of thinking for ourselves and we have agency,  Chai told The Cornell Sun, referring to Maggor\u2019s alleged comments that her outfit would invite the wrong type of attention.  Maggor responded to Chai\u2019s protest in an email to the Sun.   I do not tell my students what to wear, nor do I define for them what constitutes appropriate dress,  she said.  I ask them to reflect for themselves and make their own decisions.  After Chai gathered herself, she came back into the classroom, stripped down to her underwear and gave her full thesis presentation. In a Facebook post, Chai said she would do the same for her actual thesis presentation and encouraged others to attend and do the same. According to a statement written by 11 of the other 13 students in Maggor\u2019s class that day, the situation may have gone down a bit differently than Chai wrote on Facebook. They wrote that while Maggor made  an error in phrasing,  she had  apologized on more than one occasion.  The students added that Chai\u2019s post did not  adequately represent [Maggor\u2019s] past and continued advocacy for women and minorities.    Our intention in writing this letter is in no way to invalidate any of Letitia\u2019s experience,  the statement reads.  We strongly support and identify with Letitia\u2019s fight for equality ... The majority of us are students of color, from multi-ethnic backgrounds, who very much relate to Letitia\u2019s frustration with systemic oppression that is part of the fabric of this country. We do not want to discredit her narrative. However, we feel it is important and our obligation to share our impression of Wednesday\u2019s events to provide a fair representation of the situation.  Below is an excerpt from the students\u2019 statement detailing how the conversation in question happened (scroll below to read the letter in full): Letitia stood up to give her speech. Before she began, our professor asked Letitia if she would wear  those shorts  to her actual presentation on Saturday. Our professor regularly asks all of the students, male and female, such questions to clarify appropriate attire for public speaking. Our professor went on to say that what you wear and how you present yourself make a statement. She noted that if you were to wear jean shorts to your thesis presentation, that is a statement. Her focus on attire was a means of noting the importance of professionalism in certain public speaking situations. Maggor was unable to provide additional comment at press time, and Chai has not responded to a request for comment. In her original Facebook post, Chai wrote why she chose to protest Maggor\u2019s comments and the larger issue of policing people\u2019s bodies.   This is for every Asian woman who was told to speak up lest others think she\u2019s submissive,  she wrote.  This is for every POC man who was told to pull his pants to be taken seriously, and every POC woman who was asked to straighten her hair to seem intelligent. This is for every gay friend who was told to dress more \u2018straight\u2019 so that others didn\u2019t feel weird around him/her/them. This is for us.  Read the full statement from 11 of the other 13 students in Chai\u2019s class below.  Head over to The Cornell Sun to read more about this story.  "

Andrew Cuomo assigned a special prosecutor to investigate allegations that former state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman physically abused multiple women, according to a statement released Tuesday. A New Yorker article published on Monday detailed the stories of four women who accused Schneiderman of abusing them, including slapping and choking them. Cuomo appointed Nassau District Attorney Madeline Singas as the special prosecutor tasked with investigating the allegations and whether any resources or staff members from the attorney general\u2019s office facilitated the reported abuse.  A statement from the governor\u2019s office emphasized that the integrity of the justice system is of  paramount importance.  Cuomo also referenced the need for Singas\u2019 inquiry as the attorney general\u2019s office has an open investigation into the sexual abuse allegations against former Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.  There can be no suggestion of any possibility of the reality or appearance of any conflict or anything less than a full, complete and unbiased investigation,  the statement given to the Times said.  The victims deserve nothing less.   Schneiderman\u2019s accusers say he assaulted them without their consent during sexual encounters. Two of the women, Michelle Manning Barish and Tanya Selvaratnam, told The New Yorker that Schneiderman, 63,  repeatedly hit them, often after drinking, frequently in bed and never with their consent,  forcing them to seek medical attention. The former attorney general denied the accusations to The New Yorker but resigned shortly after the article went public on Monday.   It has been my great honor and privilege to serve as Attorney General for the people of the State of New York,  Schneiderman said in a statement late Monday.  In the last several hours, serious allegations, which I strongly contest, have been made against me. While these allegations are unrelated to my professional conduct or the operations of the office, they will effectively prevent me from leading the office\u2019s work at this critical time.  "

The director, who pleaded guilty to raping a 13-year-old girl in 1977, told Newsweek Polska that the movement highlighting sexual violence in workplaces around the world is  collective hysteria,  The Associated Press reported Wednesday. Polanski argued that people are embracing the Me Too movement  chiefly out of fear.

The U.S. Olympic Committee, as well as USA Taekwondo, turned a blind eye to decades of alleged sexual abuse by brothers Steven and Jean Lopez, two of the sport\u2019s most high-profile figures, contends a lawsuit filed Friday by four named women, as well as 44 women who have yet to be identified. The lawsuit marks the latest legal battle for the Olympic Committee, which was sued in February over its handling of misconduct claims against Larry Nassar, the disgraced USA Gymnastics doctor who pleaded guilty in November to serial sexual abuse of his patients. Over 265 women have accused Nassar of sexual assault, including Olympic gymnasts Aly Raisman and Simone Biles. The lawsuit accuses USOC, USA Taekwondo and the Lopez brothers of knowingly participating in human trafficking. The organizations were aware of the numerous sexual abuse complaints since 1996 but continued to allow the brothers to travel and interact with young female athletes, the plaintiffs contend.  The USOC is deeply focused on supporting, protecting and empowering the athletes we serve,  Patrick Sandusky, chief external affairs officer for the Olympic Committee, told HuffPost in a statement Tuesday.  We are aggressively exploring and implementing new ways to enhance athlete safety, and prevent and respond to abuse,  Sandusky continued.  The launch of the U.S. Center for SafeSport, along with a number of additional significant actions we are taking, will ensure that our athletes are better protected from these heinous acts.  USA Taekwondo coach Jean Lopez, 44, was banned from the sport last month following accusations that he sexually assaulted four female taekwondo athletes dating back to 1997. A report from the U.S. Center for SafeSport concluded Lopez had engaged in a  decades-long pattern of sexual misconduct  and allegedly used his authority as a coach to  groom, manipulate, and ultimately, sexually abuse younger female athletes.  Jean\u2019s younger brother, 39-year-old Steven Lopez, was temporarily suspended from the sport on Monday pending an investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations. Steven Lopez, a two-time Olympic champion, is one of USA Taekwondo\u2019s most decorated athletes. USA Taekwondo declined to comment on the lawsuit, but confirmed Steven Lopez\u2019s suspension.  While we cannot comment on a case in process, USA Taekwondo fully supports the important work of the U.S. Center for SafeSport and respects its exclusive jurisdiction over sexual misconduct matters,  a representative for USA Taekwondo told HuffPost in a statement.  We will resolutely enforce this immediate suspension and any other sanction imposed by the Center,  according to the statement.  We note that this is an important part of providing a safe and nurturing environment for our athletes. Today\u2019s decision is another example of the progress that is clearly being made in this area.  Neither Lopez brother responded to HuffPost\u2019s requests for comment. "

The North Carolina-based bank is among seven financial institutions that have committed to provide Remington, which filed for bankruptcy in March, with an almost $200 million lending package, reported Reuters on Sunday. Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Regions Bank each are forking out $43.2 million in loans to help put debt-plagued Remington on  stable footing,  Reuters said. The gunmaker\u2019s bankruptcy exit plan was recently approved by a Delaware judge.  Terms of the loan agreement were drawn up in late March \u2014 a few weeks before Bank of America pledged to stop underwriting or financing businesses that manufacture military-style weapons for civilian use. The bank said it made the promise after  intense conversations  with its gun-manufacturer clients \u2015 a dialogue prompted by the February massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.  We want to contribute in any way we can to reduce these mass shootings,  Anne Finucane, the bank\u2019s vice chairman, told Bloomberg TV on April 11. Remington makes Bushmaster assault-style rifles. In 2012, one of them was used by a gunman to kill 20 children and six teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. Families of the victims sued Remington to hold the gunmaker accountable for the damage caused by the weapon. The bank chose to abide by its loan commitment to Remington because it predated the April pledge, which was meant to kick in on a  go forward  basis, a person familiar with Bank of America\u2019s thinking told HuffPost on Tuesday.  Remington\u2019s financing plan was submitted to the bankruptcy court in March, said the person, who requested anonymity because of the bank\u2019s policy of not discussing client details.  But it had been in the works for weeks, if not months.  Bank of America could legally back out of its agreement to Remington if it wanted to, according to New York Business Journal; it would just have to find other lenders to cover its commitment. The person familiar with Bank of America\u2019s decision pointed out that other financial institutions were reluctant to provide loans to the struggling gunmaker. Reuters reported that 30 potential lenders had refused requests to help Remington in the weeks leading up to the company\u2019s bankruptcy. Finance experts also questioned why Bank of America did not use the loan package as leverage to push Remington to stop manufacturing military-style guns.  Fred Guttenberg, the father of a 14-year-old girl who died in the Parkland, Florida, school shooting, skewered the bank on Twitter Monday for lying to the public, and encouraged people to  stop doing business with them.  Since the Parkland shooting, several financial institutions have moved to distance themselves from the gun industry.  Citigroup, for instance, said in March it would prohibit new retail clients from selling guns to customers who are under 21, and would prevent them from selling so-called bump stocks and high-capacity magazines.   BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, recently announced that it had created new investment products for clients who are keen to specifically avoid investing in companies that make or sell firearms. This story has been updated to include comments from a person familiar with Bank of America\u2019s thinking. "

            "text": "Evangelical women from the largest Protestant denomination in the U.S. are publicly voicing their dismay over an influential leader\u2019s  inappropriate  statements about domestic violence and women\u2019s bodies. Hundreds of women who attend churches affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention have signed a petition calling for  decisive action  in response to  damaging, sinful  comments made by Dr. Paige Patterson, president of the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas, and a prominent SBC leader. The open letter, addressed to the seminary\u2019s board of trustees, asks them to take a strong stand against  unbiblical teaching regarding womanhood, sexuality, and domestic violence.   The world is watching us all, brothers. They wonder how we could possibly be part of a denomination that counts Dr. Patterson as a leader,  the letter reads.  The Southern Baptist Convention cannot allow the biblical view of leadership to be misused in such a way that a leader with an unbiblical view of authority, womanhood, and sexuality be allowed to continue in leadership.  Patterson has recently come under scrutiny after a 2000 audio clip resurfaced online in which he advised physically abused wives to stay in abusive relationships,  be submissive in every way  and try as hard as possible not to get divorced. He clarified early last week that at times, he has counseled abused women to leave \u2015 albeit not divorce \u2015 their husbands and report what was happening to the police. However, he said he still thinks that in cases of  non-injurious  abuse, women might choose to  pray through  the situation rather than leave their husbands.  HuffPost\u2019s requests for comment from Patterson and the seminary were not returned. But on Friday, Patterson told The Washington Post that he couldn\u2019t  apologize for what I didn\u2019t do wrong.  Some evangelicals\u2019 overly broad reading of wives\u2019 duty to submit to their husbands, coupled with the belief that divorce should be avoided at all costs, produces a  potent and literally deadly  combination that leads many women to keep enduring abuse, Katelyn Beaty, an editor-at-large at Christianity Today, told HuffPost last week.  It leads pastors like Paige Patterson to justify or excuse domestic violence or to see it as the price of a godly marriage,  Beaty wrote in an email.  This is a gross departure from the biblical text as well as a grave departure from the pastor\u2019s call to shepherd his members.  In addition to the 2000 audio clip, the petition signers also referred to a video clip of a 2014 sermon, in which Patterson appeared to condone the objectification of a young woman\u2019s body. In the sermon, he talked about how God  beautifully and artistically  created women. To illustrate that point, he recalled a time when he spotted a 16-year-old girl after preaching at an event.   She was nice,  Patterson said about the teenager, whom he also described as  a very attractive young co-ed.  He heard a young man near him comment,  Man, is she built.   In his 2014 sermon, Patterson said he defended the young man by saying,  He\u2019s just being biblical. That\u2019s exactly what the Bible says.  The women wrote in the petition that they were  shocked  by Patterson\u2019s objectification of that teenage girl and the  inappropriate nature of his own observations of her body.   Patterson appears in a promotional video for the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary below. The online petition against Patterson was written to gather the signatures of Southern Baptist women, but Southern Baptist men and people from outside the denomination have also signed on \u2015 including Rachael Denhollander, an evangelical Christian and the first woman to publicly accuse former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar of sexual abuse. As of Monday afternoon, over 2,000 individuals had signed the petition. Karen Swallow Prior, a professor of English at the evangelical Christian Liberty University, told HuffPost that she signed the petition to call out a  blind spot.   There is a tremendous blind spot within the old guard of the Southern Baptist Convention, and that blind spot concerns the dignity and place of members who are not white men,  Prior told HuffPost in an email.  I don\u2019t point this out in anger or bitterness, but in love, just as I would want my own blind spots pointed out to me.  The petition had some early difficulties with false signatures, but Prior said the women behind the effort have since taken steps to remove clearly fake or duplicate names. Patterson is a former president of the Southern Baptist Convention, serving for two terms from 1998 to 2000. He\u2019s credited with helping steer the SBC toward greater conservatism. He was elected to deliver the convention sermon at the SBC\u2019s annual meeting in Dallas this June, which is considered an honor for a Southern Baptist pastor.  The scandal over Patterson has divided Southern Baptists, with some calling for him to resign as president of the seminary or voluntarily withdraw as a speaker at the Dallas conference. Delegates to the meeting could also vote to rescind his preaching invitation when the conference begins in June. Other Southern Baptists have continued to offer their support. A petition defending Patterson had gathered over 100 signatures on Monday afternoon.  Roger  Sing  Oldham, a spokesman for the Southern Baptist Convention\u2019s executive committee, told HuffPost that the SBC\u2019s current statement of faith \u2015 which was revised under Patterson\u2019s leadership in 2000 \u2015 calls on Southern Baptists to  provide for the abused in society  and for  husband and wife to live up to the highest ideals of Christian conduct.    Oldham said the SBC also affirms the right of Southern Baptists to express their opinions about convention leaders. However, he said the executive committee does not have authority over or choose to comment on the business of the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary\u2019s board of trustees. On Sunday, the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary announced that Patterson had asked the board of trustees to convene on May 22  in light of recent events.  Prior said she hopes Patterson and other SBC leaders are ultimately able to recognize and repent of the ways they\u2019ve fallen short.   What I want more than anything is true recognition of sin and error \u2014 in this case a pattern of demeaning the female bearers of God\u2019s image in various ways, as well as abuse of power \u2014 and with that recognition, true repentance, not only from one individual but from all who have contributed to a culture that breeds these particular sins,  Prior said.

I\u2019ve never seen this much activism in my life,  the iconic feminist and social justice activist told clothing company Everlane, referring to gun control activism, the Women\u2019s March and the increasing number of women running for office.  It\u2019s way, way more than anything I\u2019ve ever seen,  she noted.  Steinem, 84, is the first activist to sit down with Everlane for the company\u2019s new video series titled  Human Heroes.  The series debuted Monday morning and highlights people who  have dedicated their lives to empowering their communities and making a difference,  according to Glamour.  The historic activist, who got her start as a writer for New York Magazine in 1968, told Everlane that writing was an integral introduction to organizing.    I always wanted to be a writer but thanks to the women\u2019s movement especially my life came together because I realized that as a writer I could make visible that which had been invisible,  she said. Steinem added that the most recent wave of young feminists gives her energy and, in turn, she brings them hope.   It\u2019s a great trade. We\u2019re better together, right?  she said.   Alex Spunt, head of creative at Everlane, told Glamour that the series is promoting  radical transparency,  which is part of the clothing company\u2019s mission statement.  Defending human rights has been core to our mission of Radical Transparency from the very beginning,  Spunt said.  The Human Heroes series is our way of highlighting individuals who fight for those rights every single day \u2015 and Gloria Steinem is the ultimate Human Hero. For over 50 years she\u2019s fought on behalf of disempowered and disenfranchised women all over the globe and even now, at 84 years old, she still uses her voice to educate and inspire every day.

            "text": "Michelle Obama spoke bluntly to those hoping she will run for political office, telling an audience in Los Angeles that Americans need to focus more on advocating for themselves than looking for someone else to take on that responsibility. The former first lady talked with actress Tracee Ellis Ross at the United State Of Women Summit on Saturday, covering a range of topics. Obama didn\u2019t mince words when the discussion turned to politics and a voice from the crowd interrupted to ask why she wouldn\u2019t seek an elected post.  Stop that,  said Obama, who since her husband\u2019s presidential term ended early last year has frequently said she has no plans to run for anything herself. She told her audience that society has yet to understand her husband\u2019s famed campaign slogan,  Yes, We Can.  Obama spoke about the need for women to come together as a community before looking to one individual woman to solve their problems, and said in that sense she is no different than Hillary Clinton.  When I hear people say, \u2018You run,\u2019 it\u2019s part of the problem,  she said.  We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do before we\u2019re focused on \u2018the who.\u2019 Because we\u2019re \u2018the who.\u2019   We are the answer,  she continued.  All of us here in the room are the answer to our own problems \u2015 it is not finding the one right person that we think can save us from ourselves. It\u2019s us. It\u2019s us.  Obama said that the small ways individuals find to support women\u2019s voices within their own circle will have more of an impact than she could have.  That\u2019s where it starts. Looking for the next person to run, and I don\u2019t mean to cut that off, but that\u2019s been our distraction,  she said. Mentioning that many of her husband\u2019s supporters thought he was going to be the person to  save us,  she noted that  he didn\u2019t end racism.  She made a veiled reference to President Donald Trump and his defeat of Clinton in 2016, saying,  In light of the last election, I\u2019m concerned about us as women. What is going on in our heads that we let that happen? What are girls dreaming about when the most qualified person running was a woman and look what we did? Obama also told Ross that women still need to find ways to empower the girls in their lives to have a voice.  There are still those who aren\u2019t speaking up at their own dinner tables,  she said.  They\u2019re not going to contradict their husbands or their fathers. And we have to figure out, are we doing that? Are we part of that?   Watch the entire interview between Obama and Ross in the clip above.  "

            "text": "    Beth Moore is a prominent American evangelist and author who has spent decades studying and preaching from the Bible.   But as a female leader who has worked within conservative evangelical circles for most of her life, she\u2019s faced misogyny from men in ministry \u2015 whether it\u2019s being ignored or made fun of during team meetings, or being criticized by men who flat-out refused to value Bible lessons taught by a woman.   It\u2019s a reality that the evangelist has largely kept silent about \u2015 until now. On Thursday, Moore posted a blog to her website that revealed some of the sexist attitudes she\u2019s had to endure in more than 20 years of ministry.  Moore says a respected male theologian looked her up and down during their first meeting, smiled  approvingly  and commented that she was  better looking  than another female Bible teacher he knew. She said she learned early to show  constant pronounced deference  to male leaders and when called upon to lead alongside them to  do so apologetically.  Moore said she\u2019s been talked down to by male seminary students who were years younger than her. I\u2019ve ridden elevators in hotels packed with fellow leaders who were serving at the same event and not been spoken to and, even more awkwardly, in the same vehicles where I was never acknowledged. I\u2019ve been in team meetings where I was either ignored or made fun of, the latter of which I was expected to understand was all in good fun. I am a laugher. I can take jokes and make jokes. I know good fun when I\u2019m having it and I also know when I\u2019m being dismissed and ridiculed. I was the elephant in the room with a skirt on. ... Moore is the leader of Living Proof Ministries, an organization she founded in 1994 with the intent of teaching women of all Christian denominations about the Bible. The Texas resident is the author of numerous books and Bible studies, and she\u2019s often called upon to preach at conferences around the world.  Moore was raised a Southern Baptist, part of the largest Protestant denomination in the United States. While Southern Baptists affirm that women have important roles to play in Christian ministry and accept women as students at their theological seminaries, the denomination does not generally believe the Bible allows women to teach or have spiritual authority over men. (Other evangelical denominations have come to a different conclusion about women\u2019s roles in ministry \u2015 Assemblies of God churches, for example, permit the ordination of women.) Moore wrote that many of the men she\u2019s worked with have shown her nothing but respect and support throughout her career. But she said a  colossal disregard and disrespect of women  persists in some male leaders in conservative Christian circles. For years, she chose to silently accept the challenges that come with being a female evangelical leader in the spotlight.  But she wrote on Thursday that she had decided to speak up now about these experiences for the sake of other female leaders in the evangelical world.   I cry foul and not for my own sake. Most of my life is behind me,  she wrote.  I do so for the sake of my gender, for the sake of our sisters in Christ and for the sake of other female leaders who will be faced with similar challenges.  The evangelist\u2019s blog seemed to strike a chord with many Christian women online, who started chiming in with their own stories about what it\u2019s like to be a woman in conservative Christian circles who feels called to lead and to preach. Kaitlyn Schiess, a student working toward a master\u2019s at Dallas Theological Seminary, told HuffPost about a time she experienced pushback from a male classmate.   In one of my classes at seminary, a man asked in the middle of class, \u2018How can I kindly tell my sisters in Christ that they shouldn\u2019t be in the ThM (master of theology) program?\u2019  Schiess recalled.  I appreciate his desire to be loving, but a brief discussion in class about gender roles in the Bible had prompted him to assume the role of ultimate interpreter and judge over the decisions of his female classmates.  The most important thing evangelicals can do to fight this sort of misogyny is value the insight and contributions of women, Schiess said. That means, among other things, ensuring that male pastors are  learning from and with women.   When our seminaries make it possible for men to spend three to five years studying Scripture without women showing up in their classes, on their syllabi or teaching their classes, they will be unprepared to faithfully minister to a church that is at least half women,  she said.  Other women told their own stories on Twitter about being female leaders in the ministry: Moore\u2019s blog post also provoked an outpouring of comments from evangelical men \u2015 including the prominent pastor Thabiti Anyabwile, who wrote a long letter asking for forgiveness for the attitude he had held toward women in the ministry.  I hope, with God\u2019s help, to grow in sanctification, especially with regards to any sexism, misogyny, chauvinism, and the like that has used biblical teaching as a cover for its growth,  Anyabwile wrote. Katelyn Beaty, an editor-at-large at Christianity Today, told HuffPost that verses in the Bible instructing women to submit to men have been misinterpreted by some to essentially  baptize male dominance.  An overly broad approach to women\u2019s submission, coupled with the belief that divorce should be avoided at all costs, is a  potent and literally deadly  combination that leads many women to endure abuse, she said.  It leads pastors like Paige Patterson to justify or excuse domestic violence or to see it as the price of a godly marriage,  Beaty wrote in an email.  This is a gross departure from the biblical text as well as a grave departure from the pastor\u2019s call to shepherd his members.  Moore\u2019s blog comes as controversy about the Southern Baptist Convention leader\u2019s attitudes toward women has roiled the denomination. In a recently resurfaced 2000 audio clip, Patterson, the president of a Southern Baptist seminary in Texas, can be heard claiming that physically abused women should try as hard as possible to avoid divorce. This week, he clarified that, although he doesn\u2019t condone abusive relationships, he thinks  non-injurious  abuse might spur a woman to  pray through  the situation rather than get a divorce. The scandal over Patterson has divided the denomination, with some calling for the leader\u2019s resignation and others standing by him. What Christians, particularly evangelicals, need to do is develop a theology that calls out sexism and misogyny as sins, Beaty said.  This theology will have to be developed by those who hold the most power among evangelicals \u2015 overwhelmingly conservative, white men,  she said.  Otherwise, sexism will continue to be treated as a \u2018women\u2019s issue\u2019 or a liberal/unchristian concern, and little will change.  "

            "text": "Free Drop Billy. Lone Sailor. Good Magic. Instilled Regard. If you guessed those were the names of some of the horses competing in this year\u2019s Kentucky Derby, you\u2019d be right. If you also thought that those words seem like they belong in a game of Mad Libs, you wouldn\u2019t be wrong. That\u2019s because officially naming a thoroughbred comes with some interesting limitations. The names of the Kentucky Derby contenders are often the highlight of the competition. And if you\u2019ve ever wondered how the heck someone came up with a horse name like that, then you\u2019re in luck. We\u2019re here to provide some background. The Kentucky Derby is reserved for 3-year-old thoroughbreds. The Jockey Club, the breed registry for thoroughbred horses in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, is the organization responsible for approving thoroughbred names.  Although owners can get creative with their selection, it\u2019s common to name a horse after its pedigree, including something involving the name of the horse\u2019s dam (female parent), sire (male parent) or a combination of the names. Some owners also turn to favorite pastimes or words as well as pop culture for inspiration. Then, there are the rules.  As stated on the Jockey Club site, names aren\u2019t eligible if they are more than 18 letters (the Jockey Club seems to work like Twitter, as spaces and punctuation count as letters) or are made up of only initials or only numbers (if you want to use a number above 30, it has to be spelled out, which might make you max out your character limit). Names also can\u2019t end in  filly,   colt,   stud,   mare,   stallion  or related terms. As for jockeys who also might be pop culture junkies, the Jockey Club won\u2019t approve names of living people unless it has written permission. It won\u2019t accept names of those who have died  unless approval is granted by The Jockey Club based upon a satisfactory written explanation submitted to the Registrar.  In addition, names  clearly having commercial, artistic or creative significance  won\u2019t get you anywhere (think movies, songs, etc.).  In a more obvious rule, the Jockey Club will not give the OK for names with  vulgar or obscene meaning  or names that could be offensive  to religious, political or ethnic groups.  In 2007, Slate revealed that some scandalous names (like On Your Knees) had made it to the registry, and Rick Bailey, registrar of the Jockey Club, admitted some  questionable names might have slipped by  because of the high number of submissions.  Did we mention names already in use are out of the picture? The Jockey Club does regularly put out a list of  released  names, though, or names from horses more than 10 years old that haven\u2019t been used for breeding or racing in the last five years. In December 2017, the Jockey Club released 42,659 names. These are just a handful of the rules. There are more guidelines about referencing racetracks in names and trying to give your horse what the Jockey Club considers a  permanent name,  typically designated for horses who win major races or large financial prizes. If the Jockey Club rejects a name, the most common reason is because it\u2019s already been taken. The names might not seem to make sense on the surface, but there are fun stories about the Kentucky Derby horses\u2019 names every year. Aside from horses like Magnum Moon and Good Magic that have names associated with their pedigree, there\u2019s also Bolt D\u2019Oro, a nod to Olympic champion Usain Bolt. Audible\u2019s name was inspired by a tactic used in football, according to the Lexington Herald Leader, and the name Free Drop Billy is rooted in the horse owner\u2019s friend taking frequent free drops (penalty-less moves) while playing golf.  You can thank the owners and their creativity for these fun mini histories \u2015 and the several rules they have to follow, of course. "

Volkswagen did not immediately comment An indictment filed in secret in March was unsealed in U.S. District Court on the same day as Volkswagen\u2019s annual meeting in Germany. Winterkorn resigned soon after the scandal over polluting vehicles in the United States became public in September 2015. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that the charges show  Volkswagen\u2019s scheme to cheat its legal requirements went all the way to the top of the company.  Winterkorn is charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, wire fraud and violating the Clean Air Act from at least May 2006 through November 2015 by using illicit software that allowed Volkswagen diesel vehicles to emit excess pollution without detection. Volkswagen initially suggested that only lower level executives knew of the cheating. But the indictment alleges Winterkorn was informed of VW\u2019s diesel emissions cheating in May 2014 and in July 2015 and he agreed with other senior VW executives  to continue to perpetrate the fraud and deceive U.S. regulators,  prosecutors said. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Detroit said Winterkorn was not in custody. In total, nine people have been charged and two have pleaded guilty in the case. One Italian citizen, a former Audi manager, is in Germany awaiting extradition. Six of the former Volkswagen executives charged are in Germany and have avoided facing U.S. prosecutors because Germany typically does not extradite its citizens.

            "text": "Iowa lawmakers approved a  fetal heartbeat  abortion ban on Wednesday, pushing the state one step closer to having the most restrictive stance on abortion in the country. The bill requires women seeking abortions to submit to an ultrasound to screen for a fetal heartbeat. A fetal heartbeat can typically be detected around six weeks, often before a woman realizes she is pregnant.  If a heartbeat is detected, this bill would ban Iowa\u2019s health care providers from performing an abortion.  The bill was approved by Iowa\u2019s Senate on a 29-17 vote and now heads to the desk of Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds. The governor hasn\u2019t indicated publicly whether she will sign the bill, but she is generally an opponent of abortion rights.   I\u2019m pro-life. I\u2019m proud to be pro-life. I\u2019ve made that very clear,  Reynolds said Wednesday, according to The Associated Press.  Activists on both sides of the abortion rights debate say they expect the bill to be challenged in court. In fact, some anti-abortion activists are hoping the case will make its way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, where President Donald Trump\u2019s appointee, Justice Neil Gorsuch, has effectively created a conservative majority. Abortion opponents hope they now have a shot at challenging Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that acknowledged women\u2019s constitutional right to an abortion.   We created an opportunity to take a run at Roe v. Wade \u2015 100 percent,  Republican state Sen.r Rick Bertrand of Sioux City told Reuters.  Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood, called the bill an  extreme and draconian policy that takes aim at a woman\u2019s right to control her own body, life, and future.   This bill is one more example of state politicians, emboldened by the Trump-Pence administration, carrying out policy after policy that strip away people\u2019s freedoms and access to care,  Laguens said in a statement.  The right to control your body includes the right to access safe, legal abortion. Your body is your own, if it is not, we cannot be truly free or equal.  The bill provides exceptions when the woman\u2019s life is in danger. It also allows exceptions in cases of rape or incest \u2015 but only if the woman reports the incident to police or a physician within 45 days for a rape case or 140 days for incest.  Iowa state Rep. Mary Wolfe (D-Clinton) pointed out that child victims of rape are often too scared or don\u2019t know they\u2019re pregnant until they start to show. Making it mandatory for them to report a rape within 45 days, or 6\u00bd weeks, would mean forcing these vulnerable girls to have children. Wolfe called the measure a  blatantly unconstitutional bill that tramples on the liberty of Iowa women.  A Pew Research Center survey from 2014 found that a slim majority of Iowans (52 percent) believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Forty-six percent said that the procedure should illegal in all or most cases.  Iowa isn\u2019t the only state seeking to curtail abortion rights. Laws that restrict abortion procedures after 15 weeks in Mississippi and 11 weeks in Kentucky are currently being challenged in those states.  Fetal heartbeat bills were approved in North Dakota and Arkansas in 2013 but were struck down by a federal appeals court. The U.S. Supreme Court at the time declined to review those cases.  "

            "text": "An additional 27 women have come forward to accuse former CBS News host Charlie Rose of sexually harassing them, with the allegations going as far back as 1976, a Washington Post investigation found. The latest allegations follow at least 12 other women accusing Rose, who was fired from his  CBS This Morning  gig in November, of harassing or groping them. PBS, which had aired Rose\u2019s eponymous talk show, also cut ties last fall. Over a five-month period, the Post reported that it interviewed 107 current and former CBS News employees, as well as two dozen others who had worked with Rose on different TV programs. The women accused Rose, now 76, of groping them, exposing himself to them,  appearing naked during work-related visits to his home and otherwise making sexual advances to them. Rose, who did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment on Thursday, denied the latest allegations in an email to The Washington Post, calling the newspaper\u2019s reporting  unfair and inaccurate.  Last fall, Rose had apologized for his behavior, although he said that he  always felt that I was pursuing shared feelings, even though I now realize I was mistaken.  In one of the oldest allegations, Joana Matthias, now 63, told the Post that on one occasion, Rose exposed himself to her and touched her breasts inside NBC News\u2019 Washington bureau in 1976. In another incident, former intern Corrina Collins said Rose squeezed her breast and invited her  to ride him  inside his hotel room when she was traveling with him for work in 2003.  It was a sexual land mine everywhere you stepped,  said former CBS assistant producer Beth Homan-Ross, who alleged that Rose frequently made sexual remarks about her breasts and buttocks and greeted her naked at his home during work visits. Homan-Ross, now 61, was one of seven plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed against CBS alleging an  offensive and hostile  work environment for female employees. The suit was settled under confidential terms in 1987, the Post reported. Not all of the women agreed to share their names publicly, but details of their allegations were corroborated with witnesses or individuals whom the women had confided in, the Post reported. At least two women told the paper that they took their concerns about Rose to higher-ups but that they were told he was harmless. CBS said it had no human resources complaints about Rose. Three of the women whose stories were documented by the Post \u2015 former PBS employee Brooks Harris, CBS executive assistant Chelsea Wei and former PBS assistant Sydney McNeal \u2015 are filing a lawsuit based on their allegations, their attorney Ken Goldberg confirmed to HuffPost. The lawsuit, which will likely be filed in the coming days, will sue several parties, including CBS, Rose and his company, Goldberg said. CBS President David Rhodes, responding to the Post\u2019s report on Thursday, said the network is taking steps to ensure that its employees feel safe.  Since we terminated Charlie Rose, we\u2019ve worked to strengthen existing systems to ensure a safe environment where everyone can do their best work,  he said in a statement obtained by HuffPost.  Some of the actions we have taken have been reported publicly, some have not. We offer employees discretion and fairness, and we take swift action when we learn of unacceptable behavior. That said, we cannot corroborate or confirm many of the situations described,  said Rhodes. In a separate memo sent to employees on Thursday, Rhodes said that the network has sought advice from employment lawyers at the Proskauer law firm and has added mandatory employee training about misconduct.  We\u2019ve seen that best practices in the workplace require a focus not just on sexual misconduct but also on pay practices, diversity, and inclusion,  he said.  We\u2019ve made great strides in these areas in recent years, and we want to be in a leadership role in our industry in every one of these categories.  "

When Nick was 8, my dad took him and my brother duck hunting in Grand Chenier, Louisiana, and Nick was more interested in caring for the injured ducks in the blind after they\u2019d been shot than in hunting them. At one point he got upset because some of the ducks seemed not quite dead. He wanted to end their suffering. So he tried to shoot one on the floor with his BB gun, but he missed, and the BB ricocheted and nailed my dad in the forehead. The Nick Foles who greeted me on Monday in a nondescript office at the Eagles\u2019 Philadelphia training facility was not quite the Nick Foles I knew as a kid. I hadn\u2019t seen him in 20 years. He is 6 feet, 6 inches now and in all ways a bona fide phenomenon. Grown colleagues of mine own shirts with his name on them. Men across Philadelphia have his face tattooed on their bodies. We spoke for an hour about football and fame and faith, about being an apolitical quarterback in a politically charged moment for the NFL, and about his near retirement two years ago and his unusual journey since then, from backup to star to backup again.  Nick! You\u2019re so much bigger than the last time I saw you. I have a picture of you and my brother arm wrestling when you were children.  Eagles PR guy, on his way out of the room: I bet your brother can\u2019t beat him in arm wrestling now. Nick: Taylor? He and I are getting older now, so we\u2019d probably just have a beer and call it a day.  I thought you didn\u2019t drink.  I\u2019ll drink sometimes, usually hard dry cider. I\u2019ve noticed, even though I\u2019m 29, with all the hits and everything, my body just does not feel good when I drink alcohol. We have so much to do throughout the day, and when I\u2019m healthier and on it, I can get more done and still be a dad and a husband. Do you have a vice? Do you ever just go nuts and eat a bag of Hot Cheetos?  I had two autograph signings the last two days for like eight hours, and I didn\u2019t eat yesterday, so I got home and I was starving. And we eat gluten free \u2015 my wife got real sick four years ago, so we\u2019ve had to learn, and it helps me too with inflammation. But I got home and crushed a bag of chips. They were the healthiest chips you can get, made with coconut oil and stuff like that, but I\u2019ll definitely have some gluten-free pizza.  So you don\u2019t have a vice.  [Laughs]  What\u2019s it like to suddenly be famous and see grown men around Philadelphia wearing shirts with your name on it and having tattoos of your face on their bodies?  It\u2019s crazy because when I was here the first time around, we broke a lot of records, I got a lot of notoriety for that here. Philly just loves the Eagles. But when I came back after everything that happened in my career in St. Louis and being a backup in [Kansas City], I wasn\u2019t as noticeable. I could go to the grocery store, and people would recognize me, but it wasn\u2019t a big deal. Now I go anywhere in the nation and it\u2019s a big deal.  Tori [his wife] and I were just in Hawaii on a pretty secluded island, and even there the locals knew who I was. A guy recognized me while I was snorkeling \u2014 it was crazy. People are always very nice. But I would never sit here and say you just get used to it \u2014 I don\u2019t know if anyone\u2019s ever supposed to be used to it.  What\u2019s the weirdest fan encounter you\u2019ve had?  The tattoo things are pretty crazy. I met a guy at a signing the other day \u2014 his whole back was me with a trophy on the  Rocky  steps.  Wow. Was it a good tat? What did you say? I mean, it was his whole back. Forever. There\u2019s not much you can say. I was like,  That\u2019s cool, man.  That\u2019s there forever.  Do you find Eagles fans to be different than fans of other franchises?  Yes. The thing I\u2019ve always admired about Eagles fans is that it\u2019s not fans; it\u2019s family. It\u2019s generational. I was at a signing yesterday and a lady started crying. She said,  I got to watch the game with my 90-year-old mother, and it was the greatest moment of her life, watching the Super Bowl.  Another woman said she was trying to have kids and couldn\u2019t get pregnant, and after the Super Bowl she got pregnant. The doctor said something shifted in her body that allowed her to be pregnant. Stuff like that you hear, and you realize this isn\u2019t just a game for people here.  So there are people in Philadelphia that credit you with their fertility. This team. Yes.  I saw on Instagram that you have a  Rocky  trophy in your locker. Yeah, actually the guy who made the real  Rocky  statue [in Philadelphia] sent me that after the Super Bowl.  It\u2019s funny that you saw that on Instagram. I\u2019ve never been great at social media. With what Tori and I want to do, with helping the community and maybe starting a foundation, it\u2019s important to expand that stuff. But I don\u2019t want it to be a highlight reel of me, I want it to be real. My wife gets sick, Lily [his 10-month-old daughter] hit her head the other day \u2014 stuff goes on. Though beautiful pictures of beaches are wonderful, I want to post things that inspire me \u2014 whether it\u2019s a song or something I read. I\u2019m just trying to home in on using the platform to help people. Because football \u2014 though this is awesome, and it\u2019s great to be in the NFL \u2014 I knew a long time ago this wasn\u2019t where my heart would be. But now because of this, I can help a lot of people through other avenues. I can go and speak, and people want to see me. You\u2019ve said that you want to be a youth pastor after the NFL, right?  The media sort of ran with that. People were like,  Oh, you want to be a pastor! God bless you!  When I was in Kansas City and having a tough time in my career, I decided to go to seminary to continue my spiritual growth. And the youth pastor thing \u2014 we have a great local church at home, and I always thought it would be cool to volunteer at the church. I could teach some sermons in the high school, but it\u2019s more just to be one-on-one and help those kids at that point in their life.  There are so many people on your team from different backgrounds, different religions, different political views. Do you find yourself being a spiritual leader on the team or more kind of leaving everyone alone?  I think everyone knows I\u2019m a Christian. But I just really want to show love to my teammates and show I genuinely care about them and that I\u2019m not trying to be better than anyone. When I\u2019m on a team, it\u2019s all about relationships and just getting to know each other. If you ask me about [University of] Arizona, I probably won\u2019t remember a lot of games, but I\u2019ll remember the locker room. I\u2019ll remember working hard with those guys and that friendship. The NFL\u2019s a little different because guys are in and out all the time, but when I step in the building, I just want to get to know people. I\u2019ll go in the equipment room and chat. When you actually love each other and you go into a game, it\u2019s easier to play. When adversity hits, like in the fourth quarter and stuff goes bad, no one freaks out because you\u2019re like, eh, I got it. We all care for each other. We know we can play. Every team says they\u2019re like family, but this team really is more than any other that I\u2019ve seen. That\u2019s why I believe we won the Super Bowl \u2014 because of the relationships in the locker room. That\u2019s the coolest part of the game. The number one thing I tell kids when I go speak is, if you\u2019re doing this for money, fame, girls, boys, cars, whatever, you\u2019re going to be very empty at the end of it. I can tell you that because I\u2019m who you want to be if you want to be an athlete. I\u2019m a professional athlete. And there\u2019s nothing in there. The newest car\u2019s not going to be good enough. For me it\u2019s my relationship with Christ and my family, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.    Do you and your teammates joke around and make fun of each other? Do they have any nicknames for you?   Everyone knows I\u2019m sort of goofy. Some guys are really serious when they play. I\u2019m not. In practice, when I\u2019m throwing with receivers, I\u2019ll work on some no-look throws \u2014 I\u2019ll look left and throw right. No one will ever do that in a game, but to me it\u2019s just sort of fun, and there might be a day I do do it and everyone\u2019s like,  HOW DID YOU DO THAT?  It\u2019s just off-the-wall stuff. We played ultimate frisbee the other day, and I got to be a kid and run around like crazy. Even in games, I try to keep things humorous. If I throw a really bad ball or a long out-of-bounds ball, I\u2019ll say:  Oh wow, that was really good, Nick. Wow.  But I won\u2019t be down on myself, I\u2019ll sort of laugh. An example is, during the Super Bowl I threw a touchdown to Corey Clement, our running back, that was between three defenders, and everything happened so fast. But I went through my reads, and I went to throw to Corey and in my head was like, This looks horrible. This is not how we drew it up. I\u2019m not throwing it. What do I do? And all of a sudden the safety slipped a little bit, a tiny bit, and I was like, Oh I got this. And I threw it, but that\u2019s what went through my head in a split second. And it landed between three guys and he caught it.  I have to touch on Colin Kaepernick and The New York Times story about the owners\u2019 meeting, the talk about going to the White House or not going to the White House. There\u2019s obviously a super politically charged environment in the NFL right now. Some of your teammates have been pretty outspoken about politics, but you\u2019ve stayed out of the fray. Do you think it\u2019s possible to remain apolitical as a star quarterback in the NFL?  I just don\u2019t know a lot about politics, it\u2019s something that I just don\u2019t have a great knowledge in, so I just listen and observe. That\u2019s really it. If I spoke about it, I wouldn\u2019t have a lot of knowledge in it. The character of people, the heart of people, that\u2019s where my focus is. When it comes to political issues, I look at things differently. It\u2019s not necessarily for me to speak. I might have opinions, but I like to listen in those situations, because a lot of times you can say something, but you\u2019re not going to be right either way. So it\u2019s pointless. So you\u2019re staying out of it.  [Laughs] So far.  How do you go from Super Bowl MVP to being a backup again? How do you flip that switch emotionally?  Well, it\u2019s never been done, ever in the NFL, for a Super Bowl MVP to be a backup quarterback. I thought I might have been traded a month ago, because I saw everything in the news, and we\u2019re aware of that because that\u2019s our life. We just moved into a great home here last off season, we have a ten-and-a-half month old, a great place. And if you\u2019re going to be traded, you have to be on your toes. But now that we restructured our deal, and we\u2019re here for at least another year, it\u2019s honestly a great opportunity to impact a lot of people, because a lot of people are gonna look at me and say,  Alright, let\u2019s see how he really responds. Let\u2019s see how he really acts. Let\u2019s see who he really is.  And pride does seep in, you know. You see a Super Bowl ad and you\u2019re like, wow, that\u2019s crazy! And you\u2019d love the opportunity to start. But you have to reel back in. I think everyone deals with that in some sort of fashion. You know, it\u2019s humbling. I have to humble myself daily to come in here and be a backup quarterback, sit in meetings, and I\u2019m not the starter, though two months ago we were on stage holding the Lombardi Trophy. But it\u2019s good for me. I\u2019m learning a lot about myself and growing in ways I never could imagine. Everyone else looks at it like,  Oh, you should be starting, you should be getting paid this,  and it gets in your head a little bit, and then you have to get it out. Because it doesn\u2019t matter. You really have to just focus on now and just being grateful. It goes back to perspective, like my family \u2014 seeing my daughter and my wife. We\u2019re happy. We have great people here. Just sort of enjoying the moment, because eventually football will be over.  What was it like going up against Tom Brady after having been a backup in the same season? How did you not crack under the pressure? Were you nervous?  I didn\u2019t know how my body was going to respond, because it\u2019s such a big stage. You know how you\u2019re going to prepare, but you never know until you step on that field how it\u2019s going to happen. Because you always prepare to succeed, but guys have bad games. My focus was staying in the moment, staying present. It\u2019s easy to look at the big picture and freak out, but we say,  Be where your feet are.  Like right now, I\u2019m present, I\u2019m talking to you. That\u2019s where I am. My mind isn\u2019t wandering. And with that it sort of clears the clutter in your mind. Every day I get up, make coffee, read scripture. I was journaling every day during that time, because there were so many emotions I was dealing with, for leaving the team and being in that situation.  So I felt good going into the game, but I remember sitting there for the national anthem, and I was taking everything in. And I knew the first play of the game was a pass, and on that play I\u2019d sort of get an idea of how my body\u2019s doing, how my heart\u2019s doing, how my mind \u2014 like, is everything calm? Then I dropped back, our first read was covered and did a hard reset all the way across the field and threw it to Nelson Agholor for a completion, and I remember right then I thought, I feel really really good. It was probably the most relaxed I\u2019ve ever played in a game, was in the Super Bowl, because I was just very present. The stage didn\u2019t get too big. And I really believe the reason I was so calm is because I have great teammates and that they\u2019re very talented and work hard and do what they\u2019re supposed to do. Not once this year did the offense get mad when the defense played bad, or the defense get mad when the offense played bad. That showed our team we always had each other\u2019s backs. Is that different from other teams you\u2019ve been on?  Yeah. I\u2019ve been on teams, I don\u2019t want to name them, but the attention to detail wasn\u2019t great. Schematically, we weren\u2019t great. Great guys, good people, but we didn\u2019t have a strong identity, and going into the games was very stressful, very tough. And I remember having a lot of trouble \u2014 like I\u2019ve always thrown for 300-400 yards a game since I was in high school, and it was this one year of my life playing the sport where we could barely get over 150 in a game, where I was used to throwing for that in a quarter. And it was very tough. But there\u2019s a lot of growth that happened that year. I talk a lot to younger guys, and money can blind them. I mean, when you play, you should get paid for what you do. But make sure you go somewhere with a good system, good coaches. The grass isn\u2019t always greener on the other side. It\u2019s miserable if you get on a team and you aren\u2019t playing well and everyone turns against each other. And I\u2019ve experienced that. I thought I was going to retire two years ago. That was real. That was 100 percent. I was done. It is because you lost faith in yourself and thought you weren\u2019t good anymore?  I knew I could still play \u2015 they knew I could still play at an extremely high level. I just did not like football. I couldn\u2019t touch a football. Someone would throw me a football, and I would just drop it. I\u2019d had enough, I\u2019d lost the joy. I can\u2019t do something without my heart. I think something inside me was going on, there was so much fear to play again. It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t think I could play, I just had a horrible experience and it just blinded me. But I knew there would be more growth in playing than in stepping away.  And I knew I brought so much joy to my dad and my father-in-law and my family and the people watching, and [the idea of taking that away from them] hurt. They\u2019ll watch me play the game, and it provides so much happiness and escape. My dad has rewatched the Super Bowl probably a hundred times. My father-in-law just watched it again last night. That\u2019s really sweet! My dad spent years trying to teach me how to throw a football correctly, giving me physics lectures about how my arm is like a whip. Are you going to do that to your daughter?  I\u2019ll probably teach her how to throw a football. I really just want to do everything I can to love her and just be daddy. But I think she\u2019ll have some good athletic genes \u2014 my wife is more athletic than me. She played volleyball at Arizona. She\u2019s 5-foot-10, can run, jump. And Lily\u2019s like, top percentile in length. She\u2019ll just get a toy and throw it across the room. You want to see some pictures of her? "

            "text": "Several male supervisors at a Verizon-contracted warehouse in Memphis, Tennessee, groped, sexually propositioned and harassed eight current and former female employees, according to charges the women filed last month at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal agency that handles civil rights employment cases. One woman says her boss at the fulfillment center, where workers pack and ship Verizon products, came by to offer her a peppermint, dropped it in her hand, then reached down and grabbed her breast. Another woman\u2019s boss grabbed her buttocks while he was walking by with a colleague, according to her complaint. After she reported the incident to the human resources department, her boss treated her more  harshly,  and wrote her up for not working \u2015 falsely, she says in the complaint. She quit in January. Filed in two batches at the EEOC in early and late April, the charges show what pervasive, systemic sexual harassment looks like for low-wage workers of color \u2015 the warehouse workers are primarily African American \u2015 who are often an afterthought in the recent spate of Me Too stories, which tend to focus on high-profile men and more elite, typically white, women. While the first batch of charges got some local press attention, the discrimination claims filed in late April have not been previously reported. In this case, the discrimination charges were not filed against Verizon nor do they involve the company\u2019s employees. Instead, workers have filed their claims against their direct employer, XPO Logistics, a multibillion-dollar global firm that owns the warehouse and contracts with Verizon. On Wednesday, ahead of Verizon\u2019s shareholder meeting, the National Women\u2019s Law Center, a women\u2019s economic rights nonprofit, and four other groups sent a letter to Verizon CEO and chairman Lowell McAdam, urging him to address complaints of sexual harassment at the Memphis facility. Other signers include the women\u2019s nonprofit A Better Balance, the Tennessee branch of the NAACP and SisterReach, a women\u2019s rights nonprofit that is focused of women of color in the South. The president of SAG-AFTRA, a union that represents actors, singers and other entertainers, also signed on.  The XPO warehouse reportedly exhibits a toxic culture that runs contrary to Verizon\u2019s stated policies and practices,  says the letter, provided exclusively to HuffPost on Tuesday. The letter notes that McAdam has been a vocal supporter of women\u2019s rights. The CEO recently proclaimed a zero tolerance policy for harassment at Makers, a women\u2019s conference run by Verizon-owned Oath. (Oath is also HuffPost\u2019s parent company.)  As community leaders, and women\u2019s rights advocates engaged in legal and policy work to fight against sexual harassment and active in the Times Up and MeToo campaigns and movements, we are deeply concerned with how Verizon ensures safe and dignified working conditions for the workers in its supply chain,  the letter says. The writers ask for a meeting with Verizon to further discuss the situation. HuffPost alerted Verizon to the letter on Tuesday night. The company said this was the first it heard about the situation in Memphis.  We are undertaking an immediate investigation into the matter,  Verizon spokesman Bob Varettoni told HuffPost on Wednesday, after looking at the charges.  Later that day, lawyers from both companies met to discuss the allegations, according to a letter sent to XPO from Verizon, broadly outlining their discussion and next steps.  These are very disturbing and serious allegations,  Verizon\u2019s attorneys write.  Verizon expects XPO Logistics to utilize all measures available to fully investigate the charges and take prompt and decisive remedial action if the facts warrant it.  Verizon also said that it expects frequent updates on the investigation and that it will monitor XPOs actions. The updates and investigation will  inform the basis of any decisions Verizon makes regarding the future of our contractual relationship with XPO.  The letter was addressed to two XPO executives, including in-house lawyer Richard Valitutto. According to the harassment charges, Valitutto was also employed by the warehouse\u2019s previous owners, New Breed Logistics, when it was sued for sexual harassment in 2010. The company lost that case, and a judge ordered the warehouse to closely monitor for sexual harassment issues. It\u2019s not clear what happened after that. A spokesman for XPO declined to comment on the specifics of the claims but said that the company had only reviewed the charges filed in early April and had not yet seen the late April filings.  Our culture promotes safety and respect. We have no tolerance for any form of harassment,  an XPO spokesman told HuffPost.  We promptly investigate all claims brought to our attention.  The charges raise questions about the responsibilities big companies have in dealing with the behavior of their contractors. It\u2019s a struggle that\u2019s somewhat analogous to what happens in the retail industry, where big labels outsource manufacturing overseas. Other tech firms, including Facebook, do hold their contractors to various standards \u2015 including minimum wages and benefits requirements. Many, including Verizon, say they have zero tolerance for harassment at any firm they do business with. Those kind of policies will increasingly be put to the test as the Me Too movement matures. It\u2019s possible that the next phase will spread to these fairly common arrangements, where big-name companies outsource labor needs to U.S. companies with a far lower profile.  Part of this moment demands greater accountability for preventing and addressing workplace harassment,  said Emily Martin, general counsel at the National Women\u2019s Law Center, which has signed on to the letter. Companies like Verizon should pay attention not only to the treatment of their own workers but also to those who fall under their corporate umbrella, she said. They have a lot of power to make change.  Verizon has a really important voice around the conversation they should use that power to stand up for the workers who are trying to seek justice,  said Martin, who also oversees some legal work for Time\u2019s Up, the anti-harassment initiative created by women in Hollywood in the wake of the Me Too movement. The women who filed these claims are hourly workers who don\u2019t earn a lot of money, and many are the sole breadwinners for their family, grateful for the hourly work and full-time benefits, despite the hazards of the job, said Gloria Sweet-Love, president of the NAACP in Tennessee, which signed the letter. The racial aspects of the harassment allegations are hard to miss, as the female workers at the plant are mainly African American and their supervisors\u2019 mostly white men, according to the letter from the groups. One woman alleging discrimination said her supervisor regularly made sexual comments to the women who worked under him, calling one his  chocolate baby.   They\u2019re getting the same kind of racist pathetic treatment that people in the South got for generations,  said Sweet-Love, who noted she\u2019s met with many workers inside the XPO facility, where employees are often working long and inconsistent hours, desperate to hang on to the full-time work that comes with benefits \u2015 a rarity for low-wage workers in Memphis.  These eight women are just the tip of the iceberg. There are so many more. Everybody in there is being mistreated and overworked,  she said. The facility\u2019s previous owner, New Breed Logistics, was sued by the EEOC in 2010 for harassment and retaliation involving three female temp workers in Memphis. A jury found in favor of the victims, with a $1.5 million judgment. A federal judge ordered the company to monitor complaints and issues going forward. However, while the case was on appeal, XPO bought the facility. Verizon contracted with New Breed, as well. According to the lawyer who filed the current crop of charges, XPO continues to employ executives who were there when the last suit was filed, including its human resources director and corporate counsel Valitutto.  This article has been updated with details of Verizon\u2019s letter to XPO.  Have you experienced sexual harassment or discrimination where you work? HuffPost wants to talk to you.

            "text": "Several cheerleaders for the Washington NFL team revealed to The New York Times on Wednesday that their jobs often take them off the field and into sexually charged situations with men who sponsor the team.  The report adds to the growing pile of evidence that NFL cheerleaders across the league are forced to work under unfair conditions, and, as suggested by the women who spoke to the Times, often beyond the confines of their jobs on the football field. During a 2013 calendar photo shoot trip to Costa Rica, the cheerleaders said, the team invited a group of all-male sponsors and FedExField suite holders to watch the squad members pose topless or in nothing but body paint for their photos. After one 14-hour working day on the trip, the cheerleading director told nine of the women that some male sponsors had  picked them to be personal escorts at a nightclub  that night. The director\u2019s request did not appear optional, they said.   So get back to your room and get ready,  the director told them. Several of them began to cry. The cheerleaders noted that their escorting duties did not require them to have sex with the men.  Stephanie Jojokian, the squad\u2019s longtime director and choreographer, dismissed the suggestion that the club night was mandatory. The team issued a statement stating that the cheerleaders are  contractually protected to ensure a safe and constructive environment.  The team confirmed to the Times that the cheerleaders were paid nothing for the weeklong trip, though their transportation costs, meals and lodging were covered. The cheerleaders also said they felt alarmed when, upon arrival at the resort where the photo shoot was taking place, team officials collected all their passports from them \u2015 a safety precaution, they said.  They also recounted mandatory  bonding  parties that took place on the yacht of longtime team suite holder William R. Teel Jr. with several of his friends.  One of the cheerleaders who spoke to the Times described a similar pressure to participate in the events on the yacht.  One cheerleader a few years later was told what to expect at the annual affair.  I\u2019d been given a heads-up that we were going on this particular man\u2019s yacht and that he had a lot of money \u2014 and that you could make a lot of money there if you wanted,  one cheerleader said, referring to the prize money in the dance contests.  But that was not for me, and lots of us felt the same way. But we were too scared to complain. We felt that our place on the team would be compromised if we did.  Wednesday\u2019s report comes on the heels of several other scandals plaguing the NFL\u2019s cheerleading programs.  In March, a New Orleans Saints cheerleader filed a lawsuit against the NFL citing an unfair double standard over the rules for the team\u2019s female and male employees after she was fired for violating a cheerleader-specific social media policy. The following month, a Miami Dolphins cheerleader filed a suit against the league after she said she became  a target of discipline, ridicule, harassment and abuse  from the team\u2019s cheerleading director after she posted a photo on social media of her recent baptism. UPDATE: May 3 \u2015 Team president Bruce Allen released a statement Thursday saying the organization is  looking into the situation  and that several current and former cheerleaders have given  very different first-hand accounts that directly contradict  the Times\u2019 report.

            "text": "Actress Cate Blanchett has revealed that she too was sexually harassed by Harvey Weinstein and said that she hopes the disgraced Hollywood producer and other accused sexual predators, including Woody Allen, face justice  through the judicial system.   I\u2019m interested in those people being prosecuted. We have to set a legal precedent,  she said in a Variety interview published Wednesday. When asked if Weinstein ever sexually harassed her, she said yes but declined to lay out the details, noting only that she  wouldn\u2019t do what he was asking me to do.   I think he really primarily preyed, like most predators, on the vulnerable,  the two-time Oscar winner said of Weinstein.  I mean, I got a bad feeling from him. \u2026 He would often say to me, \u2018We\u2019re not friends.\u2019  In the extensive interview ahead of next week\u2019s Cannes Film Festival, where she will serve as president of the jury, Blanchett also spoke up for Dylan Farrow, who has accused Allen of molesting herwhen she was 7 years old.  Obviously, Dylan Farrow has been living in a world of pain, and if the case has not been properly tried, then it needs to be reopened and go back into court because that\u2019s a place where those things get solved,  Blanchett said. Both Weinstein and Allen have denied all sexual assault allegations. However, Blanchett hesitated when asked if she would no longer work with Allen, who wrote and directed  Blue Jasmine,  for which she won the Best Actress Oscar. She said that when she took the role, she did not know of Farrow\u2019s allegations against the writer and director. Amid the Me Too and Time\u2019s Up movements, renewed attention on Farrow\u2019s allegations has driven several major stars to distance themselves from Allen in recent months. (Others have continued to defend Allen.)  Far more important than me adding to yet another headline \u2026 and finger-pointing is, if that issue has not been dealt with \u2026 I am absolutely for it to go back into the courts because there lies the solution,  Blanchett said.  There are many male directors who I have heard about and have not necessarily had positive experiences with whom I would not work with again who didn\u2019t lay a finger on me at all,  she continued.  There are many reasons why one doesn\u2019t want to work with people again.  Blanchett also responded to criticism that rich actresses should not discuss pay disparities, revealing that she recently turned down a role because she would have been paid less than her male co-star.  If an actor is making a profound and pivotal contribution, then they should be remunerated accordingly. And when that remuneration is different, purely because of your gender, that\u2019s just ridiculous,  she said.  It\u2019s a marker of how much you\u2019re creatively valued within the equation. You want to be valued for your work.  Read the full Variety interview here. "

            "text": "A Catholic high school in Dearborn, Michigan, has come under fire for its plan to pass out  modesty ponchos  to female students if their dresses are deemed inappropriate at their upcoming prom dance.  The colorful modesty ponchos appeared on mannequins in the halls of Divine Child High School on Monday morning. The ponchos look similar to rain ponchos and, according to a note left on a mannequin, are available in  short and long styles.    If your dress does not meet our formal dance dress requirements \u2015 no problem! We\u2019ve got you covered \u2015 literally. This is our Modesty Poncho, which you\u2019ll be given at the door,  a note attached to another mannequin reads.  The modesty ponchos came under swift criticism from students and parents alike, forcing the school to backtrack in a letter sent to the school community Tuesday. High school principal Eric Haley wrote in the letter that the ponchos were not meant to make students feel uncomfortable and were meant  to remind all students and parents of our formal Prom dress policy.   To be clear: The poncho will not be passed out at Prom. It was on display to proactively remind students of our dress code policies and eliminate any confusion prior to this special event,  Haley wrote to students and parents.  We recognize that it has done the opposite for some members of our community and draws away from our goal of having students adhere to the dress code policy.  According to the school\u2019s dress code, obtained by local news outlet Fox 2, female students cannot wear low necklines or  cutouts below the traditional bra line  to the May 12 prom dance.  The modesty ponchos were created by theology teacher Mary Pat O\u2019Malley, who said she hoped the poncho would help people see  inner beauty.   We are trying to focus on the inner beauty of people and not draw attention to something that doesn\u2019t really need to have attention drawn to it,  she said.  It\u2019s really intended as a deterrent \u2014 and a lighthearted one at that.   An anonymous Divine Child student told Fox 2 on Monday that she thought the school had  gone very far  with the ponchos and was not comfortable attending her own prom.  A parent added that the poncho would body-shame young girls.   It\u2019s a method of shaming, a method of building and degrading to females and its interpretation what\u2019s modest and what isn\u2019t,  the anonymous parent told Fox 2.  While the modesty ponchos will no longer be handed out at prom, Haley wrote that teachers will  provide wraps and shawls  \u2015 as the school has done at past events \u2015 to female students if necessary.

            "text": "A producer on the canceled Netflix show  Marco Polo  has accused disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein of repeated sexual assault and abuse over a period of years, according to documents filed with the New York Supreme Court on Monday. Alexandra Canosa describes at least 11 alleged incidents in the filing, including rape, other unspecified sexual assault, physical assault, verbal threats, forced sex acts and other abuses between 2010 and 2017. Locations included rooms and suites in various hotels, she says, such as Manhattan\u2019s Tribeca Grand Hotel, Beverly Hills\u2019 Peninsula Hotel and Budapest\u2019s Four Seasons Hotel. Weinstein  made it clear that if she did not succumb to his demands for sexual contact or if she exposed his unwanted conduct there would be retaliation, including humiliation, the loss of her job and loss of any ability to work in the entertainment business,  the filing alleges. Canosa was formerly employed by The Weinstein Company, led by Weinstein until he stepped down in October.  Dozens of women, working in front of the camera and behind the scenes alike, have leveled accusations against Weinstein, who has become a pariah in Hollywood. Canosa initially filed her suit in December, but has detailed her claims publicly for the first time this week. The court filing alleges at least one instance of rape. Canosa says Weinstein raped her in Malaysia, where parts of  Marco Polo  were filmed, in May 2014. The series debuted in December of that year.  In August 2017, weeks before The New York Times and The New Yorker would publish a series of damning accusations against the former studio head, Weinstein  verbally threatened  Canosa  not to speak to anyone about his abuse,  the filing alleges. Echoing the accounts of dozens of other accusers, Canosa says Weinstein ensured that she met with him alone under the pretense of doing work. He allegedly made inappropriate demands,  forcing himself on [her] despite repeated requests to stop,  the filing says. In a statement provided to Variety, Phyllis Kupferstein, an attorney for Weinstein, said the relationship between Weinstein and Canosa was consensual.   Ali Canosa was a friend who had worked for The Weinstein Company for 10 years, traveled the world for the company and held several influential roles; overseeing many projects throughout the years,  Kupferstein said in the statement.  From someone who has been thought of as a good friend, involved only in a consensual relationship, these claims are not only mystifying to Mr. Weinstein, but deeply upsetting, and they are not supported by the facts.  Canosa claims that other defendants named in her suit \u2015 including Harvey Weinstein\u2019s brother, Robert, and several Weinstein Company board members \u2015 were aware of Weinstein\u2019s behavior and did nothing to stop him. By USA Today\u2019s count, more than 80 women have come forward to accuse Weinstein of sexual misconduct, a blanket term for a range of abuses. He has denied engaging in nonconsensual sex, and is reportedly in and out of treatment for sex addiction and anger management at a facility in Arizona.  The Weinstein Company, now bankrupt, is facing a sale. "

Koxa mastered the monster 80-footer off the coast of Nazar\u00e9, Portugal, in November. His record-breaking feat only became official Saturday, when it was recognized with the Quiksilver XXL Biggest Wave Award at a World Surf League ceremony in Los Angeles.  The award goes to the surfer who, by any means available, catches the biggest wave of the year,  the league said in a statement.  Not only did Koxa win this year\u2019s honor, but he now holds the Guinness World Record for the biggest wave surfed.  The previous record was set in 2011 by Garrett McNamara, who rode a 78-foot wave, also at Nazar\u00e9, authenticated by the Billabong XXL Global Big Wave Awards judging committee, and confirmed by Guinness. Here\u2019s his ride: Other surfers \u2014 including McNamara \u2014 have claimed they broke the 2011 record, but Koxa\u2019s ride is the only one that has been confirmed by the WSL and Guinness records.  I got a present from God,  Koxa told The Inertia online surf news site after the awards ceremony.  It was the best present I\u2019ve ever had.  Koxa said he almost was killed in 2014 at Nazar\u00e9, where many of the world\u2019s biggest surfing waves are.   For months later, I had bad dreams, I didn\u2019t travel, I got scared, and my wife helped me psychologically,  he said.  Now, I\u2019m just so happy.  Among other honors handed out Saturday, the award for Wipeout of the Year went to British surfer Andrew Cotton, who broke his back in a horrific fall at Nazar\u00e9. He\u2019s still recovering and plans to return soon to surfing, the WSL statement said. "

Kelly struck back at the Time\u2019s Up campaign on Monday, saying the group\u2019s efforts are  unjust and off-target  after it called for an investigation into the multiple allegations against the singer of abusing women. The 51-year-old singer, whose full name is Robert Kelly, has faced accusations of sexual abuse for years, including allegations that he was involved in sex slavery and sexual abuse of minors. Time\u2019s Up, an initiative started by women in Hollywood to fight sexual abuse and exploitation, on Monday called for an investigation into the allegations against Kelly and launched a social media campaign called #MuteRKelly. In a statement, a representative for the singer expressed support for the Time\u2019s Up movement while arguing that the accusations against Kelly are unwarranted.  R. Kelly supports the pro-women goals of the Time\u2019s Up movement. We understand criticizing a famous artist is a good way to draw attention to those goals \u2014 and in this case, it is unjust and off-target,  the statement reads.  We fully support the rights of women to be empowered to make their own choices. Time\u2019s Up has neglected to speak with any of the women who welcome R. Kelly\u2019s support, and it has rushed to judgment without the facts.  Kelly\u2019s representative also said it would ultimately  become clear  that the singer is the target of a  greedy, conscious and malicious conspiracy to demean him.   R. Kelly\u2019s music is a part of American and African-American culture that should never \u2015 and will never \u2015 be silenced,  the statement said.  Since America was born, black men and women have been lynched for having sex or for being accused of it.  Representatives for Kelly did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. The #MuteRKelly campaign has been promoted on Twitter by prominent black women in the Time\u2019s Up movement, including television showrunner Shonda Rhimes, director Ava DuVernay and #MeToo founder Tarana Burke.  Some have pointed out that Kelly\u2019s alleged victims are themselves women of color, which seemingly undercuts his argument that he\u2019s being targeted because he is a black man. The statement released by Time\u2019s Up on Monday came from the group\u2019s Women of Color committee, who wrote that they hope to  shine a bright light on our WOC sisters in need.    Y\u2019all. This has been a long, hard, fought journey that SO MANY sisters have been on for more than a decade,  Burke wrote Monday on Twitter.  This man is a predator and 100% of his victims have been Black and Brown girls. At times it felt like screaming into a well, but thank God for this reckoning coming.  On Sunday, Kelly posted a video to his Twitter account where he blamed  rumors  for the recent cancellation of a show he\u2019d been slated to give at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The singer also hinted at possible legal action for the incident.   I don\u2019t know why they canceled the show,  Kelly said in the video.  I\u2019ve never heard of a show being canceled because of rumors, but I guess there\u2019s a first time for everything.  Kelly is still scheduled to perform at the Greensboro Coliseum in North Carolina on May 11. "

            "text": "By Greg Roumeliotis (Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc agreed on Sunday to acquire peer Sprint Corp, in an all-stock deal for $26 billion that will combine the third and fourth largest U.S. wireless carriers and is expected to attract regulatory scrutiny over its impact on consumers. The agreement caps four years of on- and off- talks between the companies, setting the stage for the creation of a carrier with 127 million customers that will be a more formidable competitor to the No.1 and No. 2 wireless players, Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc. U.S. regulators, which have challenged in court AT&T\u2019s $85 billion deal to buy U.S. media company Time Warner Inc, are expected to grill Sprint and T-Mobile on how they will price their combined wireless offerings. The breakthrough in the companies\u2019 negotiations, first reported by Reuters on Thursday, came after T-Mobile majority-owner Deutsche Telekom AG and Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp, which controls Sprint, agreed on a structure that will allow Deutsche Telekom to continue to consolidate the combined company, which will have a market value of over $80 billion, on its books. Deutsche Telekom will own 42 percent of the combined company, and will control the board of the combined company, nominating nine of the 14 directors. The implied equity valuation for Sprint is $6.62 per share based on T-Mobile\u2019s closing share price on Friday. The all-stock transaction is at a fixed exchange ratio of 0.10256 T-Mobile shares for eachSprint share, or the equivalent of 9.75 Sprint shares for each T-Mobile US share. Sprint\u2019s and T-Mobile\u2019s first round of merger talks ended unsuccessfully in 2014 after U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s administration expressed antitrust concerns about the deal. Under U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, regulators have continued to fret about consumer prices. The U.S. government has opened a probe into alleged coordination by AT&T, Verizon Communications and a telecommunications standards organization to hinder consumers from easily switching wireless carriers, a person briefed on the matter said earlier this month. The second round of talks between Sprint and T-Mobile ended in November over valuation disagreements, although Deutsche Telekom CEO Tim Hoettges, left the door open at the time, saying:  You always meet twice in life.  Since then, Sprint\u2019s shares lost about a fifth of their value amid questions about how the company can compete effectively under the weight of its long-term debt of more than $32 billion. Softbank has been looking to trim its own debt as well, which reached 15.8 trillion yen ($147 billion) as of the end of December. It has said it is planning to raise cash by taking its Japanese mobile phone unit public this year. Failure to clinch a deal last November left SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, a dealmaker who raised close to $100 billion for his Vision Fund to invest in technology companies, in search of other options for Sprint. Even though Sprint\u2019s customer base has expanded under CEO Marcelo Claure, growth has been driven by discounting. Analysts say that, without T-Mobile, Sprint lacks the scale needed to invest in its network and to compete in a saturated market. T-Mobile has fared better than Sprint, even if it remains a distant third to Verizon and AT&T. It has managed to score sustained market share gains, as innovative offerings, improving network performance and good customer service attract new customers, according to Moody\u2019s Investors Service Inc. T-Mobile became the first major U.S. carrier to eliminate two-year contracts, a shift quickly embraced by consumers and copied by competitors. The company has also badgered rivals with its unlimited data plans. Both Sprint and T-Mobile are far behind Verizon and AT&T in upgrading their network to accommodate next generation 5G wireless technology. Even after their merger, the combined company\u2019s budget to invest in 5G will be smaller than Verizon or AT&T\u2019s. However, Sprint and T-Mobile hope the deal will give them more firepower to participate in auction for spectrum to develop 5G. They plan to participate in a spectrum auction in late fall.

Quite a few high-profile athletes who represented the U.S. at the 2018 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games were conspicuously absent from the gathering, pointedly avoiding meeting a president with whom they disagree on plenty of issues. Among those missing: Lindsey Vonn, Gus Kenworthy and Adam Rippon, three athletes who have previously made their political differences with Trump known. Rippon, who called out Vice President Mike Pence during the Games for his anti-LGBTQ track record, seized the opportunity Friday to once again highlight this administration\u2019s discriminatory policies: Instead of attending, Rippon made donations to GLAAD, Planned Parenthood and the American Red Cross, and encouraged his followers to do the same: Kenworthy knew he\u2019d boycott the event visit since before the games started, telling CNN in February he  would definitely decline  the White House visit.  When we were at our team processing, where everyone gets fitted for an Olympic ring they said: \u2018Hey, you can pick this up at the White House visit,\u2019  Kenworthy said.  And I said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to that\u2019 and they were like, \u2018Yeah, most of the athletes aren\u2019t\u2019.  Team USA didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request from HuffPost seeking a tally of the athletes who didn\u2019t attend Friday. Also missing were Erin Hamlin (Team USA\u2019s Olympic flag-bearer), Chloe Kim, Jessie Diggins and David Wise. Hamlin told USA Today she\u2019d be visiting the Johns Hopkins Children\u2019s Center Friday morning instead of meeting Trump. And while five Olympians \u2014 Stacey Cook, Maddie Phaneuf, Arielle Gold and the aforementioned Diggins and Wise \u2014 were on Capitol Hill Wednesday to brief lawmakers on climate change on behalf of a group called Protect Our Winters, not all of them made it over to the White House to meet with Trump later in the week. Protect Our Winters spokesperson Samantha Killgore told USA Today the athletes had made the Congressional briefing a priority over the White House visit and wouldn\u2019t make it. Photos from the White House event show Gold in attendance, however, so it\u2019s unclear who from the group actually skipped out.

Many are on tour with  Stars on Ice  and simply couldn\u2019t fit it into their schedules. "

            "text": "Running phenomenon Caster Semenya of South Africa and some other top females runners will likely have to reduce their body\u2019s natural testosterone levels under new rules to continue to compete in top international races. The new rules issued Thursday by the International Association of Athletics Federations set strict limits on testosterone levels for women and  intersex  athletes in women\u2019s races. They represent a continuing struggle over how to create fair competition amid increased sensitivity and understanding about what constitutes gender in the  binary  sports establishment.  Just as the rules were announced, a leading IAAF scientist said he predicts a third  intersex  category could be established in the next five to 10 years in international competition. For now, beginning in November, the blood testosterone level must be 5 nanomoles per liter for a continuous period of at least six months for an athlete to compete in a women\u2019s event under the new IAAF track rules. The new levels, down from 10 nmol/L, will apply to all athletes with a  difference of sexual development  designation and will include only female or  intersex  athletes, not athletes designated as male, who would be barred from women\u2019s competition. The levels will apply to athletes competing in international women\u2019s events from 400 meters to the mile. The IAAF had defended its decision by saying the typical range among elite female athletes is 0.12 to 1.79 nmol/L, according to NPR. If athletes the IAAF refers to as  hyperandrogenous women  don\u2019t lower their testosterone to the new levels, they will only be allowed to compete with men or intersex athletes under the new rules, in longer events or in lower profile, non-international races.  The IAAF\u2019s new regulations are an attempt to avoid battles over gender by sticking to the basic math of hormone blood levels, specifically testosterone. High levels of endogenous testosterone can significantly enhance sporting performance.   The revised rules are not about cheating. They are about leveling the playing field to ensure fair and meaningful competition,  IAAF President Sebastian Coe said in a statement Thursday.   Like many other sports, we choose to have two classifications for our competition \u2015 men\u2019s events and women\u2019s events. This means we need to be clear about the competition criteria for these two categories. Our evidence and data show that testosterone ... provides significant performance advantages in female athletes.   The IAAF statement said that the new regulations are  in no way intended as any kind of judgement on or questioning of the sex or the gender identity of any athlete.  A court suspended testosterone levels set by IAAF in 2011 until the organization could prove high levels of the hormone provided an unfair edge in competition, which the IAAF says it has now done. The levels were criticized at the time as specifically targeted at Semenya, whose victories appeared to be hurt by the lowered levels. Her wins increased again when the new testosterone levels were suspended in 2015. But Dr. Stephane Bermon, head of IAFF\u2019s health and science department, told The Guardian that the testosterone issue affects many female athletes, not just Semenya.  It is not just the one or two people you hear about in the media,  Berman said.  In elite female athletics the number of intersex athletes is 140 times more than what you might find in the normal female population.  Bermon, who foresees an intersex competitive category in the future, insisted that restricting competition based on testosterone is fair \u2014 and does not penalize a natural gift.  The reason why we have separate male and female categories is that otherwise females would never win any medals,  Bermon said.  Testosterone is the most important factor in explaining the difference. We are talking about females competing with levels similar to males.  Semenya, 27, who won Olympic gold in the women\u2019s 800-meter races at London 2012 and Rio 2016, didn\u2019t immediately respond to the announcement of the new regulations, but last year she called IAAF\u2019s study of athletes and testosterone levels  nonsense.  She also had an angry tweet Thursday: Semenya was ordered to undergo gender testing in 2009, the year she won the 800-meter at the World Championships in Berlin at the age of 18. The results were never publicly released, and she was cleared to compete again the following year. She complained then she had been subjected to  unwarranted and invasive scrutiny of the most intimate and private details of my being  that  infringed on not only my rights as an athlete but also my fundamental and human rights.  The new IAAF rules could be challenged again in court. "

In a Friday interview with  Good Morning America  host George Stephanopolous, Cosby\u2019s publicists went so far as to compare the disgraced comedian to Emmett Till, the black teenager who was mutilated and murdered in Mississippi in 1955.  This became a public lynching,  Cosby spokesman Andrew Wyatt said on the program.  You\u2019re saying all these women, all 60 women, are lying?  Stephanopolous asked.  May I ask a question?  Cosby spokeswoman Ebonee Benson said.  Since when are all people honest? Since when are all women honest? We can take a look at Emmett Till, for example. Not all people are honest.  Till, who was 14 when he died, was lynched after a white woman falsely claimed that he had briefly and crudely accosted her. His death and the acquittal of his accused killers became a symbol of how the American justice system places far less value on black lives. The woman recently admitted she\u2019d lied. Stephanopolous appeared visibly frustrated by Benson\u2019s response. Wyatt then went after lawyer Gloria Allred, who has been representing Cosby\u2019s accusers.  What Gloria Allred was able to do, what she did, was take a salt-and-pepper shaker \u2014 she shaked out a lot of salt and sprinkled in a little black pepper,  Wyatt said.  And the south came east.

Maverick aims to provide girls and young women with ongoing opportunities to exercise their powers of creativity, curiosity, and daring in the years of their lives when they are still comfortable being messy, ambitious, and unapologetic,  Connors told HuffPost.  This is with the hope and expectation that they will become practiced and comfortable in experimenting and taking risks, in challenging the pressures of perfection, in being their real, powerful, authentic selves, and in working together \u2015 and that they will carry them forward into adulthood, and use them to make their own futures and change the world,  Connors added. The challenges come from  Catalysts,  or role models from a range of fields meant to inspire the young  Mavericks.  After sharing their work in response to challenges, users have the opportunity to view and reward each other\u2019s work with comments and badges for categories like  unique,   creative,   unstoppable  and  daring.  Chaffin and Connors develop the challenges in consultation with the role models themselves, as well as educators and  girl experts  to create experiences that are fun and thought-provoking, inspire creativity and experimentation, and encourage the young women to work together.  The two women met while working at the Walt Disney Company, where Chaffin led Disney Interactive\u2019s women and family division and Connors was editor-in-chief of Babble.  Though they bonded over their shared passion for empowering women and girls, Connors said the seeds for Maverick were actually planted some years before her time at Disney, when she was pursuing a career in academia.   My area was women and girls in social thought, with a particular focus on how they assert themselves \u2015 or rather, historically, how they\u2019re unable to assert themselves \u2015 in the public sphere. So I was very familiar with all of the research on what\u2019s sometimes called \u2018loss of voice\u2019 or the confidence gap \u2015 the phenomenon, around puberty and early adolescence, whereby girls go from being assertive and outspoken to not using their voices, not raising their hands, dropping out of sports, etc.,  Connors explained. Indeed, studies have highlighted the loss of confidence girls experience at surprisingly early ages and the importance of positive female role models in building their self-esteem. After Connors and Chaffin had both left Disney, they reconnected and decided to use their digital media experience to tackle this issue.  Girls and young women do feel extraordinary pressure to be perfect and likable and to follow the rules. Much of their current social media engagement increases that pressure,  said Connors.  Maverick\u2019s emphasis on creative messiness and authenticity allows girls to be able to push back against the myths of perfection - and to meaningfully exercise their very real powers.  In addition to research, the women also draw inspiration from Connors\u2019 12-year-old daughter Emilia.   She has always been intense and outspoken and driven and argumentative, and that\u2019s awesome. But I\u2019ve also found it really hard from a parenting perspective, in ways that have continually surprised me,  Connors told HuffPost.  I consider myself a really progressive, feminist parent, but I\u2019ve found myself, too often, imposing problematic social norms on my daughter ... Basically communicating to her that she should try to be more likable and polite and cooperative \u2015 a \u2018good girl,\u2019 who should conform to social approval \u2015 rather than letting her be the fully powerful person that she already is.  Connors and Chaffin see Maverick as pushing back against the kinds of norms and expectations that hinder girls\u2019 progress and suppress the ambition, energy and power they often exhibit at younger ages.  This goal has garnered broader support. Maverick has raised $2.7 million in seed funding from investors like LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner.  The company is also offering a live events platform with MaverickLIVE, a day of events across the country to connect young Mavericks and Catalysts and to celebrate girls on the platform and their achievements in areas like comedy, sports, music and  STEAM, a variation of STEM that incorporates the fields of art and design. The first MaverickLIVE event, which will take place in Los Angeles on April 28, will feature  Founding Mavericks  \u2015 peer role models like Laurie Hernandez, Chloe and Halle Bailey, Brooklyn and Bailey McKnight, Daunnette Reyome and Ruby Karp. Although the opportunity to connect and empower young women and girls is enticing, many parents are undoubtedly worried about social media networks and online privacy following the Cambridge Analytica scandal.   We are very focused on protecting the privacy of our users and protecting their personal data,  Chaffin told HuffPost, noting that users under 13 need parental consent to use the platform and parents can view their child\u2019s content through Maverick\u2019s parent portal.   Personal information requested to register on Maverick, such as date of birth, is collected only for authentication and is stored by trusted third-party providers,  she added.  We do not share Mavericks\u2019 personal information with anyone.  "

The shot, launched with just 1.5 seconds left on the clock, broke a tie in Game 5, giving the Cavs a 98-95 win and a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven series.  In a huddle just before that shot, James told his teammates exactly what to do.  Just give me the ball,  he told them.  Give me the ball. They had a foul to give, so I wanted to go quick so they couldn\u2019t give up that foul, because we had no more timeouts. So I was able to turn and get to my spot.   Moments earlier, he helped save the game in another way with this block:  James finished with 44 points, 10 rebounds and 8 assists in 42 minutes.  The shot was reminiscent of a similar moment nearly a decade ago, when King James sank a three-point buzzer-beater in the 2009 playoffs against the Orlando Magic:  Pacers fans looking for a little consolation can note that the Magic came back to win that series.   Game 6 is on Friday night in Indiana.  "

            "text": "Two more women have come out against the boss of disgraced coach and convicted child molester Larry Nassar, alleging the man sexually assaulted them while performing practice medical exams, according to court filings from Tuesday. Police arrested former Michigan State University dean William Strampel in late March on two misdemeanor counts of willful neglect of duty, one count of misconduct of a public official and one count of fourth-degree criminal sexual misconduct after four women accused him of sexual misconduct. The latest allegations now bring the total number of women accusing him to six. Strampel reportedly lured the two young women into becoming models for practice examinations while he was the dean of MSU\u2019s College of Osteopathic Medicine, according to Tuesday filings from the Michigan Attorney General\u2019s Office obtained by CNN.   Strampel conducted a full examination, including a breast examination, an anal examination that included the penetration of the anus, a pelvic examination that penetrated the vagina, and all were conducted in front of a small group of medical students,  a complaint from the office stated. One of the women who participated accused Strampel of saying the examinations  turned him on  and that he was  beginning to get hard,  CNN reported. Another woman accused Strampel penetrating her vagina with his fingers before offering to admit her into medical school with a score of 19 on the MCAT, 6 points lower than MSU admissions benchmark for the standardized test. Strampel is already facing allegations from four women who accuse the former dean of groping multiple female students, as well as soliciting them for nude photos and sexual acts in exchange for favorable treatment, HuffPost reported in March. A hearing scheduled for May 3 will determine whether the new testimonies of the two women will be allowed in court for Strampel\u2019s trial, according to CNN. The Michigan Attorney General\u2019s Office did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.  MSU Interim President John Engler told HuffPost that  there will be no more Bill Strampels,  in response to the new allegations of abuse during practice exams.   What I continue to learn about Bill Strampel disgusts me,  Engler told HuffPost in a statement.  Anytime concerns are raised about faculty and staff behavior, we take those concerns seriously and investigate. We will not let our students and employees down. There is zero tolerance for abusive behavior and comments. We are making changes in our Human Resource policies, including those governing evaluations and reviews.    Strampel oversaw convicted sexual abuser Larry Nassar while at MSU and handled a 2014 Title IX investigation into sexual abuse accusations against the doctor. The dean allowed Nassar to continue working throughout the investigation, a time in which Nassar continued to abuse young athletes.  Investigators have found pornographic images and videos on Strampel\u2019s computer, which included one of Nassar sexually abusing a young female athlete.  Nassar abused at least 265 children and young women during his time as team doctor for MSU and USA Gymnastics. The Michigan Attorney General\u2019s Office launched an investigation into MSU after The Detroit News reported that over the course of two decades at least 14 school officials, including Strampel, were made aware of Nassar\u2019s actions.

A jury on Thursday found the veteran entertainer guilty on three felony counts \u2015 including penetration with lack of consent, penetration while unconscious and penetration after administering an intoxicant \u2015 at a retrial in Montgomery County court in Pennsylvania. Speaking to the press outside the courthouse in Norristown, attorney Gloria Allred, who represents 33 of Cosby\u2019s accusers, denounced the 80-year-old entertainer\u2019s legal team for trying to smear the victims\u2019 reputations after they testified against him.  You tried. You failed. The personal attacks did not work,  Allred said.  Bill Cosby, three words for you: Guilty, guilty, guilty.  After the verdict, three of the women who came forward, Victoria Valentina, Caroline Heldman and Lili Bernard, left the courtroom crying, celebrating the judgment with an emotional embrace. Andrea Constand, who accused Cosby of drugging and sexually assaulting her in the present case, did not speak publicly after the verdict, but she was seen holding friends and family as she exited the courtroom.  We are vindicated, we are validated and we are now part of the tsunami of women\u2019s power and justice,  Valentino, 73, said during a press conference with other accusers and Allred.  We are not shutting up and we are not going away,  Valentino added.  Get over it.  Valentino, a former Playboy playmate, says Cosby raped her in an apartment in the Hollywood Hills in 1969. Bernard, an actress who said Cosby drugged and raped her while she guest-starred on  The Cosby Show  in the early 1990s, also spoke after the trial, praising the Me Too movement.  I stand here in the spirit of Martin Luther King, who said that the arc of the moral universe is long, but today it has bent towards justice,  Bernard said.  Today, this jury has shown what the Me Too movement is saying: that women are worthy of being believed.  She added:  This is a victory not just for Andrea Constand, who I consider to be the Joan of Arc in the war on rape. It is not just a victory for the commonwealth [of Pennsylvania]. ... It is also a victory for womanhood and it is a victory for all sexual assault survivors \u2015 female and male.  In a statement, Janice Baker-Kinney, a former bartender who said Cosby drugged her after inviting her to a house party in Reno, Nevada, said in a statement that she feels she can now move on from her assault. The  years of this toxic chain of silence has been broken and we can now move forward with our heads held high as survivors and not victims,  Baker-Kinney wrote.  This may be the end for Mr. Cosby, but this victory is just the beginning for many of us, to fight for justice, to do the right thing and support every person who has ever been shamed and humiliated and blamed.   May this verdict open the floodgates to those who have been hiding their shame for far too long,  she added. "

A statue of British suffragist and feminist icon Millicent Fawcett was unveiled in the northwest area of London on Tuesday alongside 11 other statues of historic male figures. The bronze statue portrays a 50-year-old Fawcett (around the age she became the leader of the National Union of Women\u2019s Suffrage Societies) with her hair pulled back, wearing an unassuming dress and holding a banner that reads,  Courage calls to courage everywhere.    I wanted her to be standing there not at all sexualized, but statesmanlike,  Caroline Criado-Perez, the freelance writer who created the petition last year to erect a statue in Fawcett\u2019s honor, told The New York Times.  Fawcett is the first statue of a woman and the first statue designed by a woman in the city\u2019s historic Parliament Square. The iconic women\u2019s rights activist joins the company of statues that include former British Prime Ministers Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George, alongside other international figures like Abraham Lincoln and Mahatma Gandhi.   When you think of the great people in Parliament Square, and when you realize that not one of them is a woman, it sort of begs the question, are we saying there haven\u2019t been incredible women in the past? That our country hasn\u2019t been built on the back of great women?  London Mayor Sadiq Khan said before the unveiling ceremony.  Hundreds of people gathered in Parliament Square Tuesday to witness the unveiling of the statues, the BBC reported.  Born in 1847, Fawcett was part of the first wave of feminist thinkers who pushed for women get the right to vote. She identified as a suffragist instead of a  suffragette,  a historically more well-known title but one used to identify a later wave of more militant women\u2019s advocates. Fawcett was radical in her ideology but favored non-violent protest. In 1897, she created the National Union of Women\u2019s Suffrage Societies. She died in 1929, a year after women won the right to vote in the United Kingdom.  During the unveiling ceremony, British Prime Minister Theresa May applauded Fawcett and her tireless work that changed the course of the country\u2019s history.  I would not be standing here today as prime minister,  May said,  no female MPs would have taken their seats in Parliament, none of us would have had the rights and protections we now enjoy, were it not for one truly great woman: Dame Millicent Garrett Fawcett.

Actress Lili Bernard said Cosby drugged and raped her in the early 1990s while she was guest-starring on the final season of  The Cosby Show.  It\u2019s a story many other women echoed, and today their pain was validated after a jury found Cosby, 80, guilty of drugging and sexually assaulting former college women\u2019s basketball coach Andrea Constand in 2004. After the guilty verdict was read, audible gasps could be heard in the courtroom. Bernard and her friend Caroline Heldman left the room and collapsed onto a railing, Bernard sobbing as Heldman embraced her. Longtime Cosby accuser Victoria Valentino was also seen in tears embracing Heldman.  Bernard said Thursday\u2019s verdict has restored her faith in humanity.  It is a victory for womanhood,  Bernard said at a press conference shortly after the verdict.  It is a victory for all sexual assault survivors, female and male.

Colleges, I beg you to have character, stand up for what\u2019s right and set the standard for abusers and how campuses support survivors,  the Olympic gymnast wrote on her Instagram on Monday evening.  Please create safer environments so students feel comfortable sharing their stories and take better measures to PREVENT abuse.   Raisman has been visiting college campuses to promote her new book Fierce and discuss her experience as a sexual assault survivor. She wrote that she was appalled by how many people told her they\u2019d been sexually assaulted \u2015 and by how little universities seem to care about the well-being of students.   It hurts me to hear so many students tell me their stories in tears, some for the first time, of how they were assaulted on campus,  Raisman wrote.  Many come to me because they don\u2019t know what else to do. They\u2019re traumatized from their horrible experience and also devastated and scared that their abuser is STILL walking around campus.  Raisman has become a leading voice for sexual assault survivors after publicly accusing now-imprisoned former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar of sexually abusing her for years under the guise of treatment. She has come for USA Gymnastics, the U.S. Olympic Committee, Michigan State University and people in power who enabled Nassar\u2019s predatory behavior.   To all the colleges out there, DO BETTER. Who cares if someone is a starting player, star athlete, exceptional student? If someone is an abuser, there must be consequences,  Raisman continued in her Instagram post.  Putting reputations above safety needs to stop.  College-aged women are at a higher risk of being sexually assaulted than any other age group, according to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network. One in five women and one in 16 men are sexually assaulted while at college, and more than 90 percent of those assaults go unreported, the National Sexual Violence Resource Center reports. All too often, colleges fail to disclose sex crimes in order to protect their reputation.  Raisman summed up her point with a powerful challenge:  Do the right thing and have character. Which college will be the leader in helping prevent abuse and supporting survivors?   "

Bryant helped write the teleplay with producer Ali Rushfield and West herself.  SNL  creator Lorne Michaels\u2019 Broadway Video Entertainment company will help develop the production, with Andrew Singer as executive producer. Other executive producers include Elizabeth Banks, who originally optioned West\u2019s memoir for TV in 2016, and Max Handelman\u2019s Brownstone Productions.

Bryant and West\u2019s supporters on social media are already buzzing about the news:   Bryant recently told New York magazine\u2019s The Cut that she\u2019s extremely selective about the projects she participates in, so her starring role in West\u2019s memoir adaptation is notable.

            "text": "The proposals were practically perfect.  The settings were lavish. Flowers were artfully styled. Friends and family were present. The diamond rings were sparkly and large. Chiseled men got down on one knee to propose to beautiful, tall, blond, white women.  In most TV series, these would be the ultimate happy endings for the female characters. Maybe their relationships would fall apart down the road, but in that moment, they would obviously say yes to the proposals \u2015 most likely with teary eyes and expressions of joy only the knowledge that they now (perhaps?) wouldn\u2019t die alone could bring.  But in the most recent seasons of  UnREAL  and  Jessica Jones,  the former of which wrapped up on Monday night, these familiar setups didn\u2019t amount to familiar conclusions. Both aforementioned women turned down their respective proposals, staying single by choice.  On  Jessica Jones,  Jessica\u2019s best friend Trish, an actress-turned-broadcaster-turned-wannabe-vigilante-sidekick, rejects her successful, empathetic and loving broadcast journalist boyfriend.  I don\u2019t want to be with Griffin,  she explains.  I want to be him. I want to do what he does. And that\u2019s not love, and that\u2019s not fair to either one of us.   On  UnREAL,  things get meta. The rejected proposals happen within  Everlasting,  the  Bachelor(ette) -like show that the main characters produce. Serena Wolcott is the reality show\u2019s first female lead, a whip-smart single woman who proves difficult to manipulate. On a show that usually depends on a happy ending for ratings and audience buy-in, Serena chooses no one.  I have wanted this so much, but I realize that I have to wait until I know for sure in my soul that I have found my perfect match,  she says to her two dejected suitors \u2015 and all of America. What might seem like lines plucked straight from the  How To Be a Strong Female Character  guidebook becomes something else in the hands of the  UnREAL  and  Jessica Jones  cast and crew: A rare glimpse at what a Realistic Single Female Character looks like in 2018 (though both series certainly have their pitfalls). They join an increasingly varied and lengthy list of TV shows that are subverting the idea that for women, all narrative roads lead toward and end with coupledom.  Unmarried women are a potent force in American society. As of 2016, there were 110.6 million unmarried people over the age of 18 in the United States, and 53.2 percent of those people were women. As Rebecca Traister wrote in an adapted excerpt of her 2016 book All the Single Ladies,  We are living through the invention of independent female adulthood as a norm, not an aberration, and the creation of an entirely new population: adult women who are no longer economically, socially, sexually, or reproductively dependent on or defined by the men they marry.   And yet single women are still being explicitly and implicitly told \u2015 by politicians, by pop culture creators, by the wedding industry \u2015 that their lives are fundamentally incomplete. They are constantly in a state of  becoming,  not because of personal growth and possibility, but because of what they lack \u2015 a long-term, monogamous, romantic (implied male) partner. In the words of Simone de Beauvoir:  Marriage is traditionally the destiny offered to women by society. Most women are married or have been, or plan to be or suffer from not being.   In 1960, nearly 60 percent of Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 were married. By 2011, that percentage had dropped to 20 \u2015 a record low. So what happens when, for the first time in American history, you have a critical mass of unmarried women over the age of 30 who choose to or simply find themselves in a position to build family structures, financially stable careers and homes independently? Do the stories \u2015 even the fictional ones \u2015 we tell about these women expand along with their realities? Or do we continue to privilege romantic partnership as the natural, and only truly happy, end to a female character\u2019s narrative arc?  After all, even Carrie Bradshaw, Liz Lemon and Leslie Knope ended up tying the knot. On the small screen at least, we\u2019re seeing a resurgence of complicated narratives about unmarried women. Shows like  UnREAL,   Jessica Jones,   Being Mary Jane,   The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel  and the upcoming  Dietland  are pushing the boundaries of what single womanhood looks like, spotlighting complex, wildly different stories about women who just happen to be unattached \u2015 and might not be immediately compelled to become otherwise. In  Jessica Jones,  not only is Trish unmarried, but so is the titular character herself, and, in Season 2, high-powered attorney Jeri Hogarth. Romantic and sexual relationships certainly feature in the show, but the Marvel series is ultimately about self-discovery \u2015 Jessica\u2019s embrace of her superhero status, or Trish\u2019s realization that her deepest desires are professional and not romantic. In  UnREAL,  producers Rachel Goldberg and Quinn King are both single, as is the aforementioned protagonist of  Everlasting,  Serena. The show-within-the-show might be laser-focused on manufactured love, but  UnREAL  itself is more interested in power \u2015 how it\u2019s wielded, how it corrupts, how women can reclaim it. For both series, romance is part of the equation, but it\u2019s hardly the only or even primary goal for their female protagonists, a reality that has long been accepted as the norm for male characters. In 2018, the  behavioral latitude for women is so much wider than it used to be,  film critic and author Molly Haskell told HuffPost.  It\u2019s just a real existentialist adventure for women now.   Of course, we\u2019ve seen boundary-breaking, unmarried protagonists on television before. Shows like  That Girl,  (1966-71),  The Mary Tyler Moore Show  (1970-77),  Murphy Brown  (1988-98) and  Living Single  (1993-98) centered on single women without condescension and without assuming that romance was the only project they were willing to tackle. And by doing so, they increased audiences\u2019 collective imaginations of what a single woman\u2019s life could be. (Still, some perceived these characters as threatening to the real-world status quo, like when Vice President Dan Quayle called out Murphy Brown for  mocking the importance of fathers by bearing a child alone and calling it just another lifestyle choice. ) When  Sex and the City  \u2015 another show that centered single women, but with an intentional focus on their love and sex lives \u2015 premiered in 1998, it contained a radical premise: That single women in their 30s were interesting, fabulous and could lead fulfilled lives full of great (and not so great) sex. Before the finale aired in January 2004, there was much discussion about how the series would end. As Emily Nussbaum wrote on Slate in 2002,  SATC  raised a heady question:  What, in a single woman\u2019s life, counts as a happy ending?  (For its part, the show went an emotionally satisfying but traditional route, leaving all of its lead characters in stable partnerships, though not necessarily marriages, by the series\u2019 end.) The finale of  UnREAL\u2019s  third season asks similar questions. What does a happy ending look like for a 30-something woman who runs her own company in Silicon Valley, has model looks and still finds herself dealing with men who lack the qualities she needs in a partner? What does a happy ending look like for a 30-something woman who is brilliant at her job and dependent on her equally brilliant boss, but suspects her chosen career path might be eating away at her soul? What does a happy ending look like for a woman in her early 40s who is building the empire she always dreamed about and still wants more? These questions alone make for fascinating television. For  UnREAL  co-creator Sarah Gertrude Shapiro, exploring those questions meant creating space for women  to see reflections of themselves on TV that feel layered and not stereotypical.    I think it\u2019s important to come up with different tropes and avatars that show us a different way to look at ourselves,  she said.  And also to show us being valuable \u2015 like, incredibly valuable \u2015 and not only valuable, but fulfilled.  Faced with this Very Big Goal,  UnREAL  notably resists making simplistic feminist statements for the sake of making feminist statements. In the world of the show, Serena\u2019s televised decision to stay single leads to headlines like  Beware The Princess Fantasy  and  Don\u2019t Settle, Says Serena,  while Twitter users hail Serena as a  feminist hero.  Rachel is self-satisfied and celebratory.  You\u2019ve inspired women everywhere not to settle,  she tells Serena.   That\u2019s not what this is, Rachel,  Serena says, wryly.  You produced me to pick neither guy. So what, I\u2019d end up like you \u2015 empty, alone?   No, I produced an empowered, feminist statement about not being so desperate to pair up that you overlook a mountain of flaws just so you can be done,  counters Rachel. But Serena is too astute for that.  Tell the truth, Rachel. You don\u2019t hate it here. You love it,  she says.  This is exactly where you belong. Oh, by the way, I made my choice for me, not you. I know it must kill you, but I feel great.   Moments later, we see Serena in the back of her town car. She takes out her cell phone, opens a Tinder-like app, and starts swiping, again and again and again. She\u2019s already exhausted. I found myself crying watching her, not because her decision felt tragic, but because it felt authentic. Being single, even when you are satisfied with and excited by your life, does not preclude a desire for a romantic relationship that fits. Single women aren\u2019t avatars for a feminist project \u2015 we\u2019re human beings. And sometimes, a Realistic Female Character is more interesting and more narratively important than a Strong Female Character. In fact, tragedy in both  UnREAL  and  Jessica Jones  is defined not by the end of romantic connection, but in the severing of female bonds and partnerships (Rachel and Quinn\u2019s, Rachel and Serena\u2019s, Jessica and Trish\u2019s). In contrast, triumph on these shows lies in self-discovery, a woman\u2019s reclamation of her future and its ever-expansive opportunities. Those futures might include romance, if the right opportunity arises or if it\u2019s something a given character truly desires. (A future between Quinn and her former flame Chet is teased at the end of  UnREAL,  and the last moments of the  Jessica Jones  finale show Jessica finding solace in dinner with her sexy neighbor and his son.) However, long-term romantic partnership is not a narrative given, and it\u2019s certainly not the only possible happy, or even emotionally satisfying, ending these female characters have before them.   The final moments of the  UnReal  finale find Rachel alone. She\u2019s parted ways with Quinn, her boss and intellectual equal \u2015  You are a dark twisted wreck, Rachel Goldberg. And I am going to miss every piece of it,  says Quinn, in what might be the single most romantic moment of the series \u2015 to buy the cabin in Oregon she\u2019s been quietly pining over all season. She walks around its empty rooms and out onto the porch. A small smile creeps onto her face as she looks out into the mass of greenery and empty space in front of her. She lays down on the porch, arms splayed, looking up at the sky and just breathes. The future is a question mark \u2015 one we will get to see play out, as the show has already filmed its fourth season \u2015 but she owns it. As Traister put it,  Single female life is not prescription, but its opposite: liberation.  That lack of structure is equal parts terrifying and exhilarating. Perhaps in a single woman\u2019s life, off-screen as well as on, a  happy  ending is no ending at all. "

I was in the car driving back to the hotel. And I even said out loud that last night Larry was fingering me,  Maroney, 22, told NBC  Today  co-host Savannah Guthrie in a Sunday night segment of  Dateline.  Maroney said she reported the abuse while she and her teammates were at the gymnastics world championships in Tokyo. Geddert and a few of Maroney\u2019s teammates, including gymnast and Nassar abuse survivor Aly Raisman, were in the car the night she spoke up. Maroney, who was 15 at the time, said Geddert didn\u2019t say anything in response, while others in the car  gasped  loudly. Raisman told  Dateline  that Maroney  basically described in graphic detail what Nassar had done to her the night before.  Two other people in the car that night corroborated Maroney\u2019s story to  Dateline.  Geddert worked in the gymnastics world for decades before he was suspended by USA Gymnastics in January in light of the allegations against Nassar, with whom the coach was reportedly very close. Geddert quickly resigned after being suspended and is under criminal investigation.   That was the moment that I shut it down,  Maroney said of Geddert allegedly not responding to her cry for help.  In my head, I was never gonna speak about [Nassar] again. And I was just gonna go along with it.  Geddert did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. Watch a clip of the  Dateline  interview below. Nassar, who also served as a doctor at Michigan State University, has been accused of sexually abusing over 260 young athletes. Over the last year, he pleaded guilty to several counts of sexual assault of minors and possessing child pornography and is serving three concurrent prison sentences of up to 175 years.   For the first time, to me, [it] was very, very hard for me to not acknowledge the fact that this was something \u2015 this was not treatment. I was being abused,  Maroney said.  I remember waking up the next day and wanting to tell someone.  "

The award, given to Kaepernick in an Amsterdam ceremony, is handed out each year to  individuals and groups who speak out for justice,  Amnesty says on its website, with an aim to  create debate, encourage public action and raise awareness of human rights issues.  Past recipients include Nelson Mandela, Malala Yousafzai and U2.  Kaepernick famously caused a stir by taking a knee during the national anthem at NFL games to protest racial inequality, and by refusing to stop. Other players later joined his protests. No team has picked him up after he became a free agent after the 2016 season \u2015 although an Adidas executive recently said the company is interested in sponsoring Kaepernick if he is signed. A large number of NFL managers reportedly  generally hate  Kaepernick for his activism, and he publicly earned the scorn of President Donald Trump. Kaepernick operates a charity, the Colin Kaepernick Foundation, which marked a milestone in January when it finished donating $1 million to organizations that help underprivileged communities \u2015 a pledge he made in 2016.   The Ambassador of Conscience award celebrates the spirit of activism and exceptional courage, as embodied by Colin Kaepernick. He is an athlete who is now widely recognized for his activism because of his refusal to ignore or accept racial discrimination,  Salil Shetty, secretary general of Amnesty International, said in a statement. In a speech at the award ceremony, Kaepernick touched on the death of Tamir Rice, the 12-year-old shot by police in Ohio, along with what motivates him and other social activists.  We protest because we love ourselves and our people,  he said. He echoed the sentiments in a statement issued by Amnesty:  While taking a knee is a physical display that challenges the merits of who is excluded from the notion of freedom, liberty, and justice for all, the protest is also rooted in a convergence of my moralistic beliefs, and my love for the people.

            "text": "(Reuters) - Former cycling champion Lance Armstrong on Thursday agreed to pay $5 million to settle a federal suit claiming he defrauded his sponsor, the U.S. Postal Service, by using performance-enhancing drugs, his attorney and federal officials said. The settlement ends the long-running false claims suit brought by fellow cyclist Floyd Landis and joined by the U.S. government, which had sought $100 million in damages on behalf of the Post Office, according to statements from Armstrong\u2019s attorney, Elliot Peters, and the U.S. Department of Justice.  No one is above the law,  Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division Chad Readler said in a statement.  This settlement demonstrates that those who cheat the government will be held accountable.  By phone, Peters told Reuters that he thinks the Postal Service realized it could not prove damages to it caused by Armstrong\u2019s behavior. He said the settlement was reached ahead of a scheduled May 7 trial date. Armstrong, who is now 46 and lives in Austin, Texas, won the biggest race in professional cycling, the Tour de France, a record seven times, six of them while riding for the Postal Service team. He was stripped of his titles and banned for life from the sport in 2012 by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency after it accused him in a report of engineering one of the most sophisticated doping schemes in sports. Armstrong admitted to the cheating in a January 2013 televised interview with Oprah Winfrey. This is the last legal matter related to Armstrong\u2019s doping, Peters said.  I\u2019m looking forward to devoting myself to the many great things in my life \u2015 my five kids, my wife, my podcast, several exciting writing and film projects, my work as a cancer survivor, and my passion for sports and competition,  Armstrong said in a statement provided by Peters. The settlement also calls for Armstrong to pay $1.65 million for the court costs of his former teammate Landis, who also used performance-enhancing drugs and who was stripped of his 2006 Tour de France championship. Landis originally brought the lawsuit in 2010 under a federal law, the False Claims Act, that lets whistle-blowers pursue fraud cases on behalf of the government, and obtain rewards if successful. Landis will receive $1.1 million as his share of the settlement. The Justice Department joined the case in February 2013 after Amstrong\u2019s public confession. "

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D), in partnership with State Street Global Advisors, the management group that commissioned the statue, announced on Thursday that Fearless Girl will moved from its current location by the Bowling Green park to face the New York Stock Exchange. The move is due to safety concerns and pedestrian traffic, The New York Times reports.    We are proud to be home to the Fearless Girl. She is a potent symbol of the need for change at the highest levels of corporate America \u2015 and she will become a durable part of our city\u2019s civic life,  de Blasio said.  This move to a new location will ensure that her message and impact will continue to be heard, as well as improve access for visitors.  Fearless Girl, a bronze work sculpted by Kristen Visbal, stands in a narrow spot in a corner of Bowling Green. According to city officials, this creates a safety hazard due to the large number of tourists visiting the spot every day. Other officials expressed concerns that the mix of Fearless Girl, Charging Bull and the volume of pedestrians could attract an attack similar to last year\u2019s in lower Manhattan, when a driver killed eight people.   I am thrilled Fearless Girl will remain in New York, inspiring global collaboration between genders for better decisions, and an improved environment at every strata of society,  Visbal said in a statement. De Blasio\u2019s press secretary, Eric Phillips, said that Charging Bull \u2015 a 1989 work by Arturo Di Modica \u2015 will  almost certainly  be moved with Fearless Girl, although there\u2019s no exact timeline.  Fearless Girl was erected in March 2017. Ron O\u2019Hanley, State Street\u2019s CEO, described the work as a call for companies to  increase gender diversity on their boards  and celebrate women leaders in business. However, in October, the Department of Labor alleged that State Street had paid women and black executives less than their white male counterparts. State Street disputed the Labor Department\u2019s findings but agreed to pay a $5 million settlement over the claims. Critics have accused Fearless Girl of being an empty symbol and an avatar of capitalism rather than of justice, but it\u2019s been a hit with many people and has kicked off conversations about female empowerment in different workspaces.    I\u2019m thrilled that the Fearless Girl will have a long-term home in the heart of New York\u2019s financial district,  Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) said in a statement this week.  The Fearless Girl called attention to the severe lack of women sitting on corporate boards but she connected with so many women and girls because [she] embodies the resiliency that each woman must possess to get ahead.

            "text": "Martha and Bela Karolyi of the infamous Karolyi Ranch, an elite gymnastics training center that\u2019s sent dozens of athletes to the Olympics, have finally broken their silence about former USA Gymnastics team doctor and convicted child molester Larry Nassar.  The two sat down with NBC  Today  co-host Savannah Guthrie for a  Dateline  segment set to air this Sunday. Several gymnasts claimed that Nassar, who\u2019s been accused of sexually abusing over 260 young athletes under the guise of medical treatment, abused them at the Karolyi Ranch in Hunstville, Texas.   Any child who was violated by Nassar, it\u2019s a crime and it\u2019s so sad,  Martha Karolyi said, adding that it\u2019s simply  awful.  This is the first time the couple is speaking out since USA Gymnastics cut ties with the training facility in January. The Karolyi Ranch served as USA Gymnastics\u2019 national team training center since 2001, and was the home for many elite American gymnasts including Aly Raisman, Maggie Nichols and Simone Biles. All three gymnasts, and several others, say Nassar sexually abused them at the training center.    I heard during the testimonies that some of the parents were in the therapy room with their own child and Larry Nassar was performing this, and the parent couldn\u2019t see,  Martha Karolyi said.  How I could see?   Some parents did testify during Nassar\u2019s sentencing hearings that they were in the room while the now-disgraced doctor abused their child. Nassar would often position himself in between the parent and child while he sexually abused them. Many also pointed to the institutional giants Nassar worked for, including USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University, as the reason many parents blindly trusted him.  Bela Karolyi added his thoughts during the short segment, telling Guthrie:  The whole thing is just like an explosion, a bomb exploding. Boom.   While it\u2019s still unclear whether the Karolyis knew of Nassar\u2019s abuse, dozens of athletes allege other forms of abuse took place at the ranch including verbal and emotional abuse, and limiting food intake of athletes during arduous training sessions.  National gymnastics champion and Nassar survivor Mattie Larson explained in her January victim impact statement how the isolation of the Karoyli Ranch fostered a culture that enabled a predator like Nassar.   The complete detachment from the outside world, on top of careless and neglectful adults, made the ranch the perfect environment for abusers and molesters to thrive,  Larson said.  She later called out Martha:  Martha, did you keep Larry around because he was a good doctor? Or did you really keep him around because he let us compete when we were injured and was willing to keep your secrets?   Larson described the grueling seven-hour practices six days a week that she and her teammates endured at the ranch, saying she spiraled into a deep depression and a  destructive  eating disorder at 15. She dreaded going back so much that she one time deliberately hurt herself to avoid going back to the training facility.  "

            "text": "We seem to have reached a new moment in the Me Too movement, judging by several recent stories pondering whether famous men accused of sexual misconduct are ready to re-enter the public eye.  In a Hollywood Reporter article this week, comedians and comedy club owners discussed the prospects of a career comeback for Louis C.K., who allegedly masturbated in front of several female comedians. The article asserted that reviving his career was somehow a foregone conclusion. But no quote has ever been proven false more often than F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s declaration that there are no second acts [in] American lives, so the question is not really whether C.K. will eventually come back but when, where and how. People close to chef and restaurateur Mario Batali \u2014 who attached a recipe for cinnamon rolls to an apology for his alleged sexual misconduct \u2014 told The New York Times earlier this month that he  is floating ideas, pondering timelines and examining whether there is a way for him to step back into his career, at least in some fashion.  When Mr. Batali\u2019s name comes up among groups of food professionals over drinks or between sessions at conferences, some say that if any of the men caught in the current wave of sexual harassment scandals can forge a path back, it might be Mr. Batali. Vanity Fair noted this week a tidbit buried in a New York Post Page Six story on how former  Today  show anchor Matt Lauer \u2015 who reportedly exposed himself in front of a colleague and installed a secret button to automatically lock his office door to provide privacy for harassment \u2015 is  testing the waters for a public comeback by coming out of hiding from his Hamptons home.    With his marriage to Annette Roque now over, he\u2019s ready to restart his life, pals say,  the tabloid reported. The show  Entertainment Tonight  reported that Lauer  definitely regrets his behavior  and remains hopeful of a comeback. These stories, which often feature unnamed friends and confidants describing the alleged sexual harassers in sympathetic terms,  are to be expected  as a product of male privilege, said Elizabeth Velez, professor of women\u2019s and gender studies at Georgetown University.  They\u2019re typical of male entitlement, of men \u2014 particularly wealthy, powerful men \u2014 who say, \u2018OK, I\u2019ve suffered enough. That\u2019s enough. I did what I did, and I\u2019m really sorry, and I went for treatment, and now it\u2019s time for me to do the work that I was doing,\u2019  Velez told HuffPost.  It\u2019s typical patriarchy at work.  Noreen Farrell, the executive director of Equal Rights Advocates, a legal organization that focuses on gender equality, similarly attributed the speculation over potential career comebacks to the existing  psyche and bias that keep harassers in positions of power.  A related genre of stories concerns the whereabouts of alleged sexual harassers, like a Hollywood Reporter profile of Charlie Rose last week, with sources describing the former TV host as  broken,   brilliant  and  lonely.  (The story also details how he  decamped to his four-bedroom, 5,500-square-foot Long Island home,  which includes  panoramic views of the water and Fire Island in the distance. ) Farrell characterized these anecdotes and  redemption stories  as  potentially dangerous to the progress of the Me Too movement  and  a distraction.  They deflect attention from accusers \u2015 whose lives and careers their harassers have deeply harmed \u2015 as well as from the larger institutional and systemic problems exposed by Me Too, she said.  It\u2019s about this narrative of second chances, at a moment when we should be thinking about how to help women have recovery and second chances after harassment, and I think it trivializes the harm perpetrated by these men,  Farrell said. In so many of the harassment cases that have come to light, the victims\u2019 experiences have forced them out of industries and denied them chances for career comebacks or advancement \u2014 the very opportunities that these men are now afforded.  A lot of the people who are saying, \u2018When can these people come back?\u2019... they really haven\u2019t thought through the damage, the damage to women who can\u2019t do that work, the women who have been excluded,  Velez said.  For them, there are ways in which this stopped their careers, and we\u2019re not talking about what do we do to get these women back in it.  Farrell argued that these  redemption stories  are not worth considering.  I\u2019ve had people say, \u2018Well, shouldn\u2019t people get second chances?\u2019 I don\u2019t really care,  she said.  I guess everyone moves on, and hopefully you learn from what happened. But there are also consequences, and sometimes we should focus on consequences and not on how they\u2019re going to bounce back from an accusation.  Velez suggested that at some point, the men could contemplate returning to the public eye. But she was adamant that  it\u2019s too soon,  and said it\u2019s unclear when that time could be. She also said the men should show that they will  support the women that they have harmed  and have taken responsibility for their actions beyond just apologies, such as some form of  reparations.  In a story about  second chances,  several experts told The Associated Press this week that perpetrators should attempt to seek forgiveness and make amends. Velez argued that this kind of reckoning should happen in a more public way. Noting news reports that have mentioned some of the alleged sexual harassers undergoing therapy or  self-reflection,  she said they could demonstrate their efforts to confront their behavior by publicly discussing what they\u2019ve learned.  If they want to come back publicly, sorry, you have to deal with this publicly. You can\u2019t just say, \u2018OK, I went to therapy for six months, and I get it,\u2019  she said.  I want to know about their sense of entitlement, why they think [sexual harassment] was something they could do, and what they\u2019ve come to now.  Ultimately, the onus may be on women to  really control the conversation  and move it forward, Velez said. She also expressed concern that  some of the outrage  from the Me Too movement  has sort of subsided.  Farrell said that the spate of  redemption stories  present a new challenge for the movement: making sure that the focus remains on helping survivors of sexual violence.  Look, the harassers have gotten enough attention, and we need to be concerned more with survivors,  she said.  I do think that there are people in this country who identify with people who are harassers and are rooting for them to be able to have comebacks, and I think our job in the movement is to make sure people are identifying with people who are survivors.

Maroney, in her first interview since she went public with allegations against Nassar in October, said he abused her  every time  she saw him after that initial experience \u2015  hundreds  of times.  He said that nobody would understand this and the sacrifice that it takes to get to the Olympics so \u2018You can\u2019t tell people this,\u2019  Maroney told NBC  Today  co-host Savannah Guthrie for a  Dateline  report set to air on Sunday.  He didn\u2019t say it in a way that was like mean or anything like that. I actually was like, \u2018That makes sense, I don\u2019t want to tell anybody about this.\u2019 I didn\u2019t believe that they would understand.  Nassar, who also was Michigan State University team doctor, has been accused of sexually abusing over 260 young athletes under the guise of medical treatment. He\u2019s now serving three concurrent prison sentences of up to 175 years for sexual assault and child pornography. Maroney told Guthrie that Nassar groomed her by bringing her food \u2015 a show of affection in a sport that consistently starves its athletes.   I would\u2019ve starved at the Olympics if I didn\u2019t have him bring me food,  Maroney said, adding that Nassar bought her a loaf of bread.  Your coaches are just always watching you and wanting to keep you skinny. There\u2019s just other things about the culture that are also messed up that he used against us.  Maroney signed a confidentiality settlement with USA Gymnastics in December 2016 barring her from sharing her story. The organization said in January it wouldn\u2019t seek to punish Maroney if she chose to break the agreement.  During a luncheon on Tuesday for the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children in New York City, Maroney said it seemed as though all USA Gymnastics  cared about is money and medals.    I wasn\u2019t listened to, cared about or believed, and all of those things need to be weeded out of society because that\u2019s where things went wrong,  she said at the event.   Neither Michigan State University nor USA Gymnastics immediately responded to HuffPost\u2019s requests for comment on Maroney\u2019s remarks.  Other Nassar survivors, including Maroney\u2019s Olympic teammate Jordyn Wieber, and Olympic athletes from other sports, testified before a U.S. Senate committee on Wednesday, encouraging lawmakers to help combat sexual abuse in amateur sports. The same day, seven women filed lawsuits against MSU, USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee, alleging Nassar abused them.  "

            "text": "The Securities and Exchange Commission has waded into the debate over what investors can do to stop fossil fuel companies from destroying the Earth\u2019s habitable climate. And in siding with a major oil company, the agency inadvertently strengthened the case for divesting from fossil fuels altogether.  Late last year, Trillium Asset Management, an investment firm that works with environmental groups but also has fossil fuel investments, proposed a shareholder resolution calling for EOG Resources, one of the largest oil producers in the country, to set a target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. But before shareholders could vote on the proposal, EOG complained to the SEC, requesting approval to ignore the proposal, which it said would  micromanage  the company with a  rigid and time-bound  target.  In February, the SEC agreed with EOG\u2019s concerns, stating shareholders  would not be in a position to make an informed judgment  on the  matters of a complex nature  on which the resolutions sought to act. Last month, the SEC sent a formal letter to Trillium rejecting the proposal, allowing EOG to ignore the resolution and block a vote. Axios\u2019 Amy Harder, who drew national attention to the case earlier this month, called the move  unprecedented,  leaving investors  stunned.   The ruling is a major setback for advocates who say internal shareholder pressure from high-minded investors is the best way to reduce pollution by corporate giants. It also adds new weight to arguments calling for more severe government intervention in the energy industry, either by nationalizing utilities and fossil fuel producers or imposing steep levies on emissions and extractive industries. But with Republicans in control of all three branches of the federal government and Democrats largely wrestling over whether to embrace more leftist economic principles, neither of these prospects is likely to happen in the near future.  So, at least in the short term, the SEC decision strengthens the case that the only serious strategy for investors to pressure fossil fuel companies is to completely pull their money out. In the year leading up to last February, shareholders filed 429 resolutions, 83 focused on climate change, according to an annual report tracking such proposals. Of that 83 figure, which represents 20 percent of all proposals, 27 resolutions called for carbon risk disclosures and another 27 demanded that companies set deadlines for reducing emissions.   Such proposals, even when enacted, do little to incentivize companies to change polluting business practices while providing a veneer of progressive action. Take, for example, Exxon Mobil Corp. The oil giant caved to shareholder pressure last year to thoroughly account for its climate change risks and, in February, issued its first report. But, in a brazen move, the report claimed there is nearly no risk to Exxon Mobil\u2019s business.  In March, Occidental Petroleum, one of the largest oil producers in Texas, responded to shareholders\u2019 climate concerns with its own report, finding, curiously, that the company\u2019s business won\u2019t be impacted by global warming or policies to reduce the emissions causing it.  The existence of the reports represents the start of slow change at these companies, said Danielle Fugere, president of the nonprofit As You Sow, which tracks shareholder proxy fights. Even if the reports are tailored to bolster companies\u2019 profit outlook, she said they provide information to investors that can ultimately strengthen the case for divestment.  Even when a company doesn\u2019t necessarily give you the response you want, their response gives you information, and that\u2019s the real goal,  she told HuffPost.  Obviously the oil and gas companies haven\u2019t changed what they do, but from an investor perspective, even getting them to think about how they can transition is good.   But that sort of patient approach to shifting away from fossil fuels conflicts with the increasingly dire warnings from climate scientists who say the world economy requires an urgent transformation to avoid planetary catastrophe. Small, incremental fixes in the form of market solutions and corporate reformism represent what The Intercept\u2019s Kate Aronoff described as  denial by a different name.    Shareholder resolutions and shareholder activism pushing fossil fuel companies to change has to take into account what we are really asking for: We need to see real decarbonization plans,  Ben Cushing, who helps lead the Sierra Club\u2019s Beyond Dirty Fuels campaign, told HuffPost.  That really gets at the core of the fossil fuel industry\u2019s business model.   The divestment movement gained significant momentum this year after New York City announced plans in January to pull roughly $5 billion in pension fund investments out of oil, gas and coal companies and sue oil companies for climate change-related damages, a move quickly followed by other cities. European capitals including Berlin, Stockholm and Paris made similar divestments in 2016.   Since companies weren\u2019t being responsive to shareholders anyway \u2015 witness Exxon\u2019s recent absurd declaration that it faced no real climate risk \u2015 it may save everyone the trouble of pretending that they\u2019ll someday actually engage,  Bill McKibben, the founder of 350.org, told HuffPost.  It further strengthens the already overwhelming argument for divestment, and makes politicians like Bill de Blasio and Scott Stringer look prescient for the announcement earlier this year that New York City was done playing around with these guys.   Still, even divestment is only a first step.   The dominant framework has been about a neoliberal approach and it has failed over and over again,  Ashley Dawson, author of the book  Extreme Cities: The Peril and Promise of Urban Life in the Age of Climate Change,  told HuffPost.  That whole approach is hugely flawed, so I think we need to really think about a much more radical solution.  Dawson pointed to the proposal from British Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn to nationalize the electrical grid and shift the United Kingdom to 65 percent renewable energy by 2030.   We need to have really progressive conversations about how we get from where we are presently to carbon zero state,  he said.  To have a conversation about how to do that on a national scale and how to do that at a really fast rate we need to be talking about a public push rather than the kind of market-based arguments you hear so much in the United States.

Sleepwear company Lunya has decided to use  The Handmaid\u2019s Tale  \u2014 a book and television show about sexual slavery \u2014 to help sell lingerie. On Monday, the company announced that the red shade of one of its  washable silk  sets would be dubbed  Offred  after the protagonist in Margaret Atwood\u2019s 1985 dystopian novel and Elisabeth Moss\u2019 character in the popular Hulu series.   Praise be!  Lunya declares on Facebook and Instagram.  Meet our limited-edition silk set. Join the resistance just in time for #handmaidstale season 2.  In the book and show, Offred is a woman who is kidnapped and forced to have sex with a married couple in order to produce a child for them. She wears red so that she is easily identifiable as someone\u2019s property. Her name also denotes that she is someone\u2019s possession. Offred\u2019s  Commander,  or male captor, is named Fred Waterford (portrayed in the show by Joseph Fiennes), and her new name literally means  of Fred.   The decision to name this color Offred was rooted in the color itself, being a kind of \u2018off Red color,\u2019 and our enthusiasm for the powerful nature of Elisabeth Moss\u2019s character in the show and as a symbol of our solidarity with the Resistance,  Ashley Merrill, Lunya\u2019s founder and CEO, told HuffPost in a statement. In the book and show, Offred is part of the Resistance, an underground movement to overthrow the Republic of Gilead, the totalitarian society that enforces sexual slavery. Merrill also noted in her statement that Lunya is a female-founded company and most of its employees are women.  Our team is focused on supporting programs and bringing awareness to key issues such as education, opportunity and health for women,  she said. Despite the good intentions, some people on Twitter couldn\u2019t help but point out how odd the decision was. We\u2019ll just let Offred take it from here: "

            "text": "Prosecutors in Bill Cosby\u2019s sexual assault retrial will present the jury with the disgraced comedian\u2019s 2005 testimony about giving quaaludes to women after a judge ruled it admissible on Tuesday, The Associated Press reported Tuesday. In the testimony, Cosby admitted under oath that he obtained a prescription for the now-illegal drug in the 1970s and gave it to women he wanted to have sex with.  Judge Steven O\u2019Neill\u2019s decision to admit the testimony represents a win for prosecutors, who are attempting to portray Cosby as a habitual abuser in the criminal case brought by former Temple University basketball coach Andrea Constand. It also means that jurors will hear the same admissions as in the original trial \u2015 but this time, paired with testimony from five other accusers. O\u2019Neill ruled in March that the five additional accusers could testify in court because their claims closely match Constand\u2019s. Only one other accuser, Kelly Johnson, who worked for Cosby\u2019s agent, was permitted to give testimony the first time around. Constand says Cosby, now 80, drugged and sexually assaulted her at his Philadelphia home in 2004. He faces three counts of aggravated indecent assault.  On Tuesday, the new jury began hearing Cosby\u2019s account of what happened with Constand, which also came from his 2005 testimony. According to Cosby, he gave Constand cold and allergy medicine at his home to help her relax before touching her sexually. The entertainer said Constand did not object to being touched, and his lawyers say there is no evidence that he gave Constand quaaludes instead of over-the-counter medicine. Johnson won\u2019t take the stand again in the retrial. Instead, prosecutors will try to corroborate Constand\u2019s experience with testimony from former bartender Janice Baker-Kinney and former models Heidi Thomas, Chelan Lasha, Lise-Lotte Lublin and Janice Dickinson.  Cosby\u2019s 2005 testimony originated from Constand\u2019s civil suit against the comedian, brought about a year after the alleged assault. That case was settled for around $3.4 million and the testimony sealed \u2015 until a judge unsealed it in 2015. Authorities then filed charges against Cosby late that year. A hung jury resulted in a mistrial last June. The retrial, however, is the first jury trial of a high-profile figure since the Me Too movement against sexual misconduct started gaining steam. "

            "text": "Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods won\u2019t be returning their unsold assault-style rifles to manufacturers. Instead, the company says it\u2019s chosen to destroy all of them. Dick\u2019s announced in February \u2015 following the school shooting in Parkland, Florida \u2015 that it would stop selling assault-style rifles and high-capacity ammunition magazines in all of its Field & Stream stores, where these items had been sold by the large sports retailer. The company also announced that it would no longer sell guns to people under the age of 21 at any of its stores. A company spokeswoman told The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette last week that the retailer was  in the process  of destroying the unsold inventory of rifles, which include AR-15s and other military-style semi-automatic weapons, at its four distribution centers nationwide.  We are destroying the firearms in accordance with federal guidelines and regulations,  the representative said, adding that weapon parts would be sent to a salvage company to be recycled. Dick\u2019s did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for clarification on how many guns it was destroying or how the company was going to dispose of them.  The National Rifle Association, in a Tuesday Twitter post, lambasted the company\u2019s decision to destroy the weapons.  What a waste,  the gun group wrote. The NRA and other gun-rights advocates have assailed Dick\u2019s for taking a political stance that could end up hurting its business, with some calling for a boycott of the retailer. But the company\u2019s stock price has remained relatively unchanged since February. Under federal regulations, a gun must be  cut, severed or mangled in such manner as to render the firearm completely inoperative and such that it cannot be restored to an operative condition  to be considered destroyed. The destruction of a firearm must also be recorded with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Although there is no officially outlined process for disabling an assault-style rifle, the ATF recommends making a series of cuts to a gun\u2019s receiver, the piece that houses a firearm\u2019s internal components. It\u2019s unclear if Dick\u2019s had the option of returning its assault-style rifles to gun manufacturers, which typically offer dealers partial refunds for unsold firearms.  Gun companies aren\u2019t obligated to accept merchandise back from a retailer or a wholesaler, but they normally do accept it and reimburse minus a restocking fee of 10 percent to 20 percent, which is what the retailer/wholesaler loses from what he originally paid,  said Mike Weisser, a Massachusetts-based gun dealer who has previously blogged for HuffPost as  Mike the Gun Guy.  Dick\u2019s choice to destroy the assault-style rifles rather than return the firearms to a manufacturer that could redistribute them seems consistent with the company\u2019s efforts to take a principled stance in the wake of the Parkland shooting, in which 17 people were killed at a high school.  Thoughts and prayers are not enough,  Dick\u2019s CEO Edward Stack said in February as he announced the company\u2019s decision to end the gun sales.  We support and respect the Second Amendment, and we recognize and appreciate that the vast majority of gun owners in this country are responsible, law-abiding citizens. But we have to help solve the problem that\u2019s in front of us. Gun violence is an epidemic that\u2019s taking the lives of too many people, including the brightest hope for the future of America \u2015 our kids.   Dick\u2019s has pulled assault-style firearms from its shelves before. In the aftermath of the 2012 shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, that killed 26 people, the company stopped selling the rifles at its main stores. It resumed selling them, but only at its 35 Field & Stream stores, in 2013. "

            "text": "While his genius may be largely uncontested, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s vision of Facebook is badly adrift from reality. He paints the social media behemoth he founded in 2004 as a tool  to bring the world closer together,  but in many ways, it has become an indispensable amplification device for people who want to make it known that they hate other people. Testifying before Congress last Wednesday, Zuckerberg declared:  We do not allow hate groups on Facebook, overall.  As with many things the Facebook CEO said during his trip to the Hill last week, it was difficult to square this statement with the actual experience of using Facebook. Angry observers were quick to point to anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic, anti-Rohingya, anti-LGBTQ and other hateful groups actively operating on the platform. Zuckerberg\u2019s claim hit a nerve for me as well. Two months ago, a private Facebook group devoted to alt-right Trump memes inaugurated a campaign of sexual harassment against me. When alerted to the situation, Facebook\u2019s response was, essentially, \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. On Feb. 13, I awoke to find a stream of friend requests on Facebook and a startling message from a man I did not know:  There is some random weirdo posting pictures of you.  He sent me a screenshot of a photo posted in the private Facebook group  Emperor Trumps Dank Meme Stash,  which had more than 72,000 members at the time. There I was: standing on the beach in Oahu, wearing shorts, a bikini top and a cardigan. I loved that photo \u2015 it was a reminder of a day spent hiking and swimming with my family during our first vacation together in years. I posted it on Facebook last April. I was stunned as I stared at it almost a year later, along with my full name, literally hundreds of comments and a caption that read:  This is going to be a hard one guys. Huffington Post reporter, smash or pass?  Immediately, I requested permission to join the closed group and was directed to answer two questions for approval by its administrators:  Where do you fall on the cuck spectrum?  and  Are you a normie?   I turned back to the man who had alerted me to the photo and asked him to send me screenshots of as many of the responses as possible, so I could email them to the appropriate representatives at Facebook. As is common in the publishing industry, HuffPost and Facebook work closely on products, partnerships and other shared objectives.  It is a lot of comments,  he warned.  None of them are nice.  It\u2019s difficult to describe how it feels to discover hundreds of complete strangers debating how fuckable you are. Or to see them casually suggest they\u2019d like to  smash,   pump  and  skullfuck  you as an apparent form of punishment for your gender and job title. Dozens of my friends and coworkers reported the group to Facebook. Several hours later, Facebook responded to them with a message saying it had discovered content that  doesn\u2019t follow our Community Standards.  It added:  We removed that specific content \u2026 instead of the entire group.  But subsequent screenshots showed my photo was still there.  A staff manager at HuffPost also contacted Facebook directly to request that the post be taken down as quickly as possible. His message contained the screenshots of comments and stressed the matter\u2019s urgency. Two days later, a representative followed up and asked him for the link to the post with the photo, which was inaccessible to anyone who did not belong to the private group (and which I had failed to obtain from the growing swarm of  trolls  in my inbox). The Facebook representative said that without the link, not much could be done. So the harassment continued, and it worsened. As my account was flooded with creepy messages and friend requests (now 890 and counting), one of my colleagues wrote a public Facebook post asking others to report the group, hoping that it might expedite the process of getting my picture removed. Soon enough, the trolls found her profile, too.  We\u2019ll just post your pic and do a smash or pass,  one man wrote on her status below two other nasty comments. Another appeared in her inbox:  SMASH.  It was clear that she was also being targeted in  Emperor Trumps Dank Meme Stash.  She deactivated her account. My photo remained posted in the group for at least six days \u2015 long enough for it to garner even more attention and be shared to at least three other pages. So after nearly a week of apparent inaction from Facebook, I got in touch with one of the group\u2019s administrators, who can review reports about members\u2019 posts, remove content and revoke membership as they please. He told me that the picture might have  flown under the radar.    Don\u2019t blame me,  he said, after assuring me he had taken the photo down.  Blame Facebook for their stupid reporting system.  When I asked him to let me join the group, so I could see for myself that it was gone, he refused. With a growing network of more than 2 billion users around the globe, Facebook\u2019s role in shaping the way we communicate online cannot be easily overstated. It has public policies in place to penalize those who violate its Community Standards (including posts containing nudity, hate speech and violent or graphic content). These users may have their content removed or their accounts disabled, or may even be reported to law enforcement.  Moderating hate speech is an issue  that we struggle with continuously,  Zuckerberg said last week.  There\u2019s a lot of content flowing through the systems and a lot of reports, and, unfortunately, we don\u2019t always get these things right when people report it to us.  He vowed that Facebook would have  more than 20,000 people working on security and content review across the company  by the end of the year, acknowledging that  no amount of people that we can hire will be enough to review all of the content.  But instead of advocating for more moderators, pundits have long been calling for greater transparency surrounding the organization\u2019s internal content review standards to ensure consistent enforcement and accountability \u2015 a plea many say has fallen on deaf ears. A Guardian investigation into leaked documents from Facebook, including private guidelines for content moderation, revealed last year that phrases like  To snap a bitch\u2019s neck, make sure to apply all your pressure to the middle of her throat  are allowed, while others like  Someone shoot Trump  are not. The report noted that moderators often have  just 10 seconds  to make a decision when evaluating material. It also said many have concerns about  the inconsistency and peculiar nature of some of the policies,  especially those regarding sexual content. Experts have cautioned that inadequate moderation practices can have serious consequences, such as fostering a culture of online impunity \u2015 leading sites like Facebook to become breeding grounds and safe havens for harassment. Whereas trolls used to work under the cover of relative anonymity on sites like 4chan and Reddit, many of the Facebook users who commented on my photo and sent me grotesque messages, astonishingly, felt comfortable enough to do so using their real profiles \u2015 with their real names, photos, locations and even places of employment listed.   Alejandra, who works at a debt-relief company in Fresno, California, commented:  Smash with a ballgag so she doesn\u2019t speak.  Ironically, in a public bio statement sitting atop her Facebook profile, she has written:  I don\u2019t care who you are if you are kind to me I will be kind to you, it\u2019s that simple.  Michael, a New York-based account manager who was previously a cadet first lieutenant at a military academy in Pennsylvania, wrote that he would  Smash, but I\u2019ll unload on her face\u2026 for the patriarch.  On his professional website, he lists his favorite Bible verse as Psalm 133:  How good and pleasant it is when God\u2019s people live together in unity!  Far from promoting unity, Facebook is an ideal ecosystem for hate groups to flourish. During Zuckerberg\u2019s appearances on the Hill last week, much was made of his site\u2019s explosive growth and transformation, but from my vantage point, staring at screenshots from  Emperor Trump\u2019s Dank Meme Stash,  Facebook looks remarkably unevolved. A platform that grew out of a  hot or not  women-ranking site is now a place for users to debate  smash or pass.   Upon receiving a request for comment for this article on Friday \u2015 two months after HuffPost initially alerted Facebook to the situation \u2015 the organization said it would review  Emperor Trump\u2019s Dank Meme Stash.  By day\u2019s end, the group was taken down.  As groups evolve, we can evaluate their activity over time,  a spokesperson said in a statement that evening.  We have removed this group for violating our policies.  A  revival  page is up and running with nearly 7,000 members.  Free Speech does not exist here,  its description reads.  Blame Zuck.  "

True to form, Crews took a moment to point out how masculinity contributes to issues of sexual violence and gender inequality.   Masculinity can be a cult,  Crews said.  And when I say \u2018cult,\u2019 it\u2019s no different than David Koresh. It\u2019s no different than Jim Jones.

            "text": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Tony Rosado sits in the silent back room of El Mercado with a giant stack of papers piled in front of him on a sturdy wooden table. The papers are part of his appeals to stop the construction of Lorena Plaza, a 49-unit supportive housing complex that has been proposed for an empty parcel of land next to his market in this historically Latino neighborhood east of downtown.  Why in Boyle Heights?  he asked.  I dare you to go try and build this in Beverly Hills. It would never get through.   El Mercado, which Rosado took over after his father died in 2014, is a three-story restaurant and market packed with stalls of vendors, or puestos, selling cowboy boots, Communion dresses, religious paraphernalia, tubs of obscure moles and dried sweets. Boyle Heights is one of the most heavily Latino communities in the city, and El Mercado is its vibrant nerve center.  Lorena Plaza is one of the complexes that nonprofit developers have proposed to house the 58,000 people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles. Voters approved a 2017 ballot measure calling for a $1.2 billion bond to fund permanent supportive housing for the chronically homeless. But where exactly that housing should go has proven a much more difficult question.  Boyle Heights is known citywide for its residents\u2019 vigorous anti-gentrification efforts. They\u2019ve fought to keep richer, whiter transplants from encroaching on their territory. In a sense, Rosado\u2019s fight to keep housing for the homeless out of his neighborhood is part of the same struggle for agency. Rosado says Lorena Street isn\u2019t the right place for housing for the homeless. El Mercado gets busy on the weekends, and cars zoom down Lorena Street and into the parking lot. A Metro train line also runs nearby.   To put a sensitive population so close to a busy cultural center and next to exposed railroad tracks?  Rosado said.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right thing to do.  The Rosado family has been fighting Lorena Plaza for years. They filed an environmental appeal with the city\u2019s Planning and Land Use Management Committee in May 2017, citing uncapped oil wells on the property that could present a danger to residents if they leaked. The family found a sympathetic ear with Councilmember Jose Huizar, who approved their appeal in the committee and stalled construction until a full environmental review was conducted. Housing developers and other critics claim such resistance pits communities against the will of citywide voters. In an open letter to Huizar during the appeal meetings, L.A.\u2019s top nonprofit developers argued that the appeal  would deny Los Angeles voters the mandate and action they overwhelmingly supported.   We all care and we all want to eradicate homelessness,  said Janet Kim, a Los Feliz resident and member of a multi-neighborhood homelessness task force, SELAH Neighborhood Homeless Coalition, that includes residents from Silver Lake, Echo Park, Los Feliz, Atwater Village and Hollywood. The problem, she said, is  that people are on the fence about how we\u2019re going to do that.  This concern isn\u2019t limited to Boyle Heights. Residents of Venice \u2015 a wealthy, white oceanside neighborhood where companies like Snap Inc., Google, YouTube and Vice have mutated the community into a post-gentrification business district of sorts \u2015 have also fought plans to build housing for the homeless.  Suburbanites in leafy, pleasant Temple City have successfully stalled the redevelopment of a motel that was planned for supportive housing. Property owners in Lincoln Heights are also rallying against a handful of housing proposals.  Five is too many,  reads the mission statement of the Coalition to Protect Lincoln Heights. Still, Rosado thinks his situation in Boyle Heights is different from other conflicts around the city. Residents here feel their voices have been ignored, and say community outreach was inadequate for this kind of development. A Community of Friends, the nonprofit developer seeking to build Lorena Plaza, seems surprised by the backlash. In the past 30 years, ACOF has built 42 supportive housing complexes in the city without much controversy.  The word I would use to describe us was \u2018stealth,\u2019  said Dora Leong Gallo, ACOF\u2019s director.  We built the buildings, we operated and moved people in, and nobody was the wiser. People ask if this is a brand-new thing, like we\u2019ve never done it before. That\u2019s not quite true.  Gallo knows better than most the complexities of building units in a city historically constrained by rigid planning laws, and ACOF usually navigates the process well. But the Lorena Plaza development has been particularly difficult. Gallo believes the Rosados\u2019 environmental appeal was disingenuous. The opposition to Lorena Plaza stems from stereotypes of the homeless, she argued, pointing to the Rosados\u2019 initial appeals. The late Pedro Rosado told a Metro Board hearing in 2013 that he was  very appalled how people are not mentioning that in this facility they are trying to bring mentally ill people to put our children at risk.   Boyle Heights was already primed for a fight over development. Non-local artists have been opening new galleries here, like 356 Mission and BBQ LA, which attracted the ire of activist-residents. Last year, Weird Wave Brewers, a coffee shop owned by two white men and a Latino man (none of whom live in Boyle Heights), opened on Cesar Chavez Avenue, prompting concerns that the neighboring Arts District \u2015 which is demographically wealthier, whiter and younger \u2015 was trickling into the barrio. Rosado argues that the city is taking advantage of the mostly Spanish-speaking, low-income residents of Boyle Heights, and that other neighborhoods would never have to fight so hard to keep out a proposal like this.  They would lobby their representatives and then bombard their offices with calls,  he said.  They would pull all their financial support for their campaigns if their representatives were allowing these types of projects to get through.  He suggested that people experiencing homelessness be housed on the outskirts of the city,  where it\u2019s not the white-collar people that are affected or the blue-collar.  On March 6, the L.A. City Council held a final vote on the Lorena Plaza environmental appeal. Dozens of supporters of the project, identified by fluorescent yellow stickers that said  Lorena Plaza, SUPPORTER,  packed the aisles of City Hall\u2019s chambers. There did not appear to be any critics of the development present. The Rosado family was not in attendance, but their lawyer read aloud a statement arguing that the city is responsible for investigating the environmental concerns thoroughly, and urging the council to pursue a new assessment. ACOF\u2019s Gallo also addressed the council, telling them her organization has  remained optimistic and steadfast in our belief that this is a good project at a good location, and reasonable people who care about the state of homelessness in Los Angeles can successfully negotiate a solution.  Huizar, the councilmember, raised concerns about community involvement in the proposal.   It\u2019s not an issue of NIMBYism or against permanent supportive housing. It\u2019s an issue about community process, building trust, no matter what you\u2019re building \u2015 whether it\u2019s a retail center, permanent supportive housing, commercial,  he said.  Whatever it is, there needs to be trust between the applicant, the developer and the local community, and that\u2019s what was lacking here.  Yet Huizar recommended that his colleagues deny the appeal and allow ACOF to build Lorena Plaza. Then the council cast its vote: thirteen in favor of allowing the development to go forward, and zero opposed.  Gallo said she was pleased with the result, especially Huizar\u2019s about-face.  It\u2019s a pretty incredible feeling to have him change his mind, because it\u2019s hard, and he does want what is best for his community, and I recognize that,  she said. Gallo expects to break ground in fall 2019, with a completion date toward the end of 2020. Tony Rosado said he is  disappointed,  but isn\u2019t backing down yet.  We\u2019re going to continue fighting it,  he said.  We\u2019re going to pursue our legal options.   In a statement to HuffPost, Huizar said the developer has agreed to complete the necessary environmental review, and will ensure the soil is clean. He also emphasized the importance of community involvement as the city seeks housing solutions for people experiencing homelessness.   As we unroll our efforts to construct permanent supportive housing throughout the City, we need to be completely honest with the public from the outset and throughout the approval processes,  he said.  That doesn\u2019t mean everyone will be happy with every project, but unlike this process, at least we\u2019ll all be clear about what is being proposed.  On April 5, Rosado filed suit against the city of Los Angeles, alleging that environmental law had been broken. The writ, submitted by Rosado\u2019s lawyers, asks for the city\u2019s decision to be vacated in lieu of a full environmental review. It also asks for the suspension of the  authority of City and City Council... to grant any authority, permits or entitlements as part of the Project  until a full review is conducted. This story is part of the series Homeless on the Streets of L.A., a four-month investigation by students at USC Annenberg\u2019s Reporting on the Homeless class. The project, overseen by veteran journalists Mary Murphy and Sandy Tolan, continues through early 2019. Contact atolan@usc.edu or mmurphystar@yahoo.com for more info. "

            "text": "Former supermodel Janice Dickinson testified at Bill Cosby\u2019s retrial on Thursday that she fabricated parts of her memoir, including a story that she  rebuffed  the disgraced comedian\u2019s advances.  It\u2019s all a fabrication there because I wanted the paycheck for my kids,  Dickinson testified in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, where Cosby is charged with sexually assaulting a former Temple University women\u2019s basketball coach in 2004.  Dickinson, one of five women set to testify for the prosecution to bolster the account of chief accuser Andrea Constand, said the real story of her 1982 encounter with Cosby in a Lake Tahoe, California, hotel room was that he drugged her and raped her.   Here was \u2018America\u2019s Dad\u2019 on top of me \u2015 a happily married man with five children,  Dickinson testified.  And I remember thinking how wrong it was \u2015 how very, very wrong.  Dickinson said she later confronted Cosby and  wanted to hit  him.   I wanted to punch him in the face,  she said. She admitted fabricating parts of her 2002 ghostwritten memoir, No Lifeguard on Duty: The Accidental Life of the World\u2019s First Supermodel, under cross-examination by Cosby\u2019s attorney, Tom Mesereau.  In the book, Dickinson says she rebuffed Cosby\u2019s advances, popped two Quaaludes, and went to sleep. She testified that the sexual assault was cut from the memoir because her publisher, Judith Regan, said it could ruin her entire career. Under cross-examination, Dickinson said her memoir\u2019s account of that night was  all a fabrication  for a paycheck. The book\u2019s ghostwriter, she said, took  poetic license.   When Mesereau pushed Dickinson to explain the contradiction between the book and her courtroom story of the assault, she replied:  They weren\u2019t there! And you weren\u2019t there! And I\u2019m telling the real story!  She added:  I put my hand on the Bible and I swore. I wasn\u2019t under oath when I wrote the book.  Many memoir writers embellish stories and leave out aspects they don\u2019t want to share. Glossing over the heart of her testimony, however, could present a problem for the prosecution in the second trial for Cosby. The comedian\u2019s first trial ended in a mistrial in June, when the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict.  Cosby\u2019s lawyer unsuccessfully sought a mistrial earlier this week, days after testimony in the new case got underway. On Wednesday, a visibly emotional Chelan Lasha took the stand and described how Cosby drugged and assaulted her when she was 17 in Las Vegas in 1986.  As she finished testifying and the judge began dismissing court for lunch, Lasha looked at Cosby and said,  You know what you did  or  You remember, don\u2019t you, Mr. Cosby?  according to various reports. The defense objected to the outburst, but Common Pleas Judge Steven O\u2019Neill denied the mistrial request.  "

            "text": "There were moments over the past few years when it seemed like misogynist in chief Donald Trump would be held accountable for the way he has treated women. But at each turn, the president emerged unscathed. Then on Monday, the FBI raid on Trump lawyer Michael Cohen\u2019s office and hotel raised the prospect once again. Cohen\u2019s apparently been under criminal investigation for months, according to court papers prosecutors released on Friday. It is incredibly early to say this with any certainty, but it\u2019s starting to look possible that women could ultimately topple the Trump presidency.  Not Russia. Women.   The scandals prompted by two women, Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, reportedly led the FBI to Cohen\u2019s door. Federal agents were reportedly seeking information on hush agreements the adult film star and the former Playmate signed to stay silent about their alleged affairs with Trump. The agreements may have violated federal campaign finance laws, raising the real possibility of criminal charges for Cohen \u2015 and maybe even for Trump himself. The nonprofit Common Cause filed complaints with the Department of Justice and the Federal Election Commission in January over the hush agreements, alleging they are campaign finance violations. The punishment for breaking such laws includes fines and even jail time.  At a time when the Me Too movement has brought down many powerful men for sexual misconduct, the alleged violations raise the prospect of bagging the biggest whale of all.  Though the raid this week was a sign of how serious the situation is, there are a million caveats going the other way: First, there is no publicly available evidence that Trump knew about these payoffs. He didn\u2019t even sign the agreement with Daniels and denies he knew about it or had an affair with her or McDougal. Cohen said he paid Daniels without Trump knowing.   Even if the feds nail the evidence, successfully pressing the case in court would be technically pretty tricky, legal experts say. Recently, former presidential candidate John Edwards was charged with campaign finance violations and went to trial, but the jury couldn\u2019t agree on his guilt. Also, recall that no sitting U.S. president has ever been charged with a crime.  The more obvious punitive route would be impeachment, which seems unlikely at the moment because Trump\u2019s party runs Congress. And even if the Dems were running the show, it\u2019s not clear they\u2019d want to make a whole thing out of what seems to be essentially a sex scandal \u2015 20 years after the Lewinsky debacle. (Though not everyone sees this as simply a salacious story.) Further, campaign finance violations aren\u2019t exactly the sexiest, most outrageous crimes around.   And of course, no one knows what special counsel Robert Mueller \u2015 who\u2019s already done a lot of damage to the Trump administration with indictments and criminal charges \u2015 still has up his sleeve. And yet, right now, the campaign finance violations do seem further along than the Russia case to a number of experts.    The public evidence we know on the campaign finance issue is more clear to us at this moment,  said Liam Brennan, a former federal prosecutor who was the lead attorney in the prosecution of former Connecticut Gov. John G. Rowland (R) for campaign finance violations.  From what is publicly known, there is fairly compelling evidence that campaign finance laws were broken,  he said.  Cohen has already admitted he paid Daniels $130,000, but said the president was not involved. McDougal\u2019s $150,000 came from the folks at American Media Inc., home to the National Enquirer, but McDougal\u2019s lawsuit says the company acted in coordination with Cohen. American Media Inc. denies all of this. Though the alleged affairs happened more than a decade ago, the payoffs came right before the election: McDougal\u2019s just after the Republican National Convention in August 2016, Daniels\u2019 a week before the general election, right when the  Access Hollywood  tape was imperiling Trump\u2019s campaign.  The maximum amount an individual can contribute to a campaign is $2,700 \u2015 obviously, far less than $130,000. Corporations are prohibited from making donations to individual candidates. The timing of the payouts increases the likelihood that they\u2019ll be seen as money spent on getting Trump into office \u2015 if the women\u2019s stories had emerged prior to the election, the reasoning goes, they would\u2019ve hurt Trump\u2019s chances. Particularly Daniels\u2019 story, which was kaiboshed during Pussygrab-gate. In fact, according to reporting from The New York Times, FBI agents were also looking for information tied to that infamous recording, wherein Trump brags to host Billy Bush that he is very famous and can just kiss women without asking and grab them by their genitals. If prosecutors are able to build a compelling case against Cohen \u2015 and possibly Trump \u2015 around these payments, it\u2019s plausible that the president could find himself facing criminal charges, legal experts told HuffPost.  That road leads to possible impeachment and even a criminal trial, where the president and his lawyer could face fines and even, yes, jail time \u2015 up to five years, said Paul S. Ryan, vice president of policy and litigation at Common Cause.  Imprisonment is exceedingly rare, but it happens occasionally,  he said. Still, a case would hardly be a slam dunk.  Proving intent in white-collar cases is extremely difficult,  Brennan, the former prosecutor, said.  While it  seems obvious  the intention was to protect the Trump campaign, it can be hard to prove, he said. The keys will be: Will Cohen talk and will agents find compelling hard proof to back up the case?  And it\u2019s an open question as to how seriously anyone is going to take these scandals. The sexual nature of Daniels and McDougal\u2019s stories may make prosecutors and Congress  squeamish,  Brennan added.  (Remember, it\u2019s mostly men making these decisions.) And to get to Trump, legal experts said, there needs to be more evidence.  In order to pin any of this on Trump, he would have needed to know what\u2019s going on,  said Laurie Levenson, a criminal law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.  That\u2019s why it\u2019s key to find a link,  she said \u2015 possibly paperwork of some sort, an email or a letter.  At this point, the worst-case scenario for Trump would be a finding that Cohen and others were involved in illegal activity, Levenson said \u2015 some kind of criminal activity, maybe campaign finance violations, but possibly bank fraud, which FBI agents are reportedly also looking into. If Cohen or others talk, they could end up pointing a finger at Trump and saying not only did he know, but he was orchestrating all of this.  You have to make a lot of jumps and assumptions,  she said. Still, the prospect remains delicious. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said the Lewinsky scandal was 30 years ago. It was 20 years ago. "

The  How To Get Away With Murder  actress spoke at Tina Brown\u2019s 9th Annual Women in the World Summit in New York on Thursday night. She discussed everything from her love for acting to social justice and the importance of diverse representation in Hollywood. During her discussion with MSNBC host Joy-Ann Reid, Davis took a few moments to break down the lifetime effect sexual violence has on its victims.   Women always say that\u2019s the day that they died,  Davis said, referring to the day victims were sexually assaulted.  And that trauma escalates into side effects that are life-changing.  Davis said the trauma of sexual assault can trigger suicidal thoughts, addiction issues, body dysmorphic issues and so much more.   You could go into any prison in this country and, I guarantee you, you could trace it all back to sexual assault,  she added, speaking of women inmates. Watch another highlight from Davis\u2019 interview below. Every 98 seconds, someone is sexually assaulted in the U.S., according to the Rape Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN). Women and girls experience sexual violence at a much higher rate than boys and men, while transgender people experience sexual violence at the highest rate.  We have 324 million people in this country, 51 percent are women, and trust me when one is traumatized and it escalates \u2014 it escalates into rage issues, incarceration, murder \u2014 all kinds of things,  Davis continued.  When Reid asked if there\u2019s any way to depict sexual assault realistically and genuinely in Hollywood films, Davis responded honestly.   When we go to see movies, we want our buttered popcorn and diet soda and Sour Patch Kids \u2014 we want to escape,  she said. She added later:  There\u2019s not a whole lot of laughs in truth sometimes.   Watch Davis\u2019 full Women in the World interview below. "

            "text": "You don\u2019t matter. That\u2019s the message every survivor hears loud and clear when a rape kit goes untested. Behind every kit is a person \u2015 usually a woman \u2015 who has been brutalized in the most intimate of ways. And yet there are estimated to be hundreds of thousands of untested rape kits currently sitting in police storage across the country.  So, how did we get here?  That\u2019s the question actress and activist Mariska Hargitay answers in her new HBO documentary  I Am Evidence,  set to air April 16. The film, produced by the  Law & Order: Special Victims Unit  star and Trish Adlesic, and co-directed by Adlesic and Geeta Gandbhir, takes a human approach to an epidemic that has reduced survivors, their stories and their trauma to a box of evidence.   To me, the backlog is one of the clearest and most shocking demonstrations of how we regard these crimes in our society,  Hargitay says in the film.  Testing rape kits sends a fundamental and crucial message to victims of sexual violence: You matter. What happened to you matters. Your case matters.   In a conversation with HuffPost, Hargitay and Adlesic laid out the herculean task they had in front of them four years ago when they began making this documentary.  One of the things that was so difficult about making this movie is that there is just so much pain involved,  Hargitay said. She hopes the documentary  holds up a real hard mirror  to people who have turned a blind eye to this epidemic.  Watch the trailer for  I Am Evidence  below. Story continues below video.  And the film is a hard one to look away from.  I Am Evidence  features 14 courageous survivors telling their stories of assault and the subsequent poking and prodding that comes with enduring a rape kit.   I am evidence that there is more to that box, there is a human being there. It is not just a kit. This is a person,  a survivor named Erica says in the film.  The women discuss the inevitable re-victimization of being questioned by law enforcement and the agonizing wait to get their kits tested \u2015 a wait that often never ends.  The fact of the matter is, if we have DNA testing, if we have the ability to fix this problem and we don\u2019t test these kits, we\u2019re saying that sexual assault is not important,  Hargitay said.   Since the rape kit backlog hit the public consciousness nearly 10 years ago, 225,000 rape kits have been uncovered, according to a program called End The Backlog. That program is the work of anti-sexual violence nonprofit The Joyful Heart Foundation, which Hargitay founded after thousands of survivors shared their abuse stories with her after she began appearing as Detective Olivia Benson on  SVU.  Testing rape kits is important for several reasons: It can identify an unknown perpetrator, it can confirm the presence of a known suspect, it can confirm a survivor\u2019s account of an assault, it can help solve other cases that might not involve sexual violence, it can exonerate innocent people. And it can connect a suspect to other crimes around the country. Indeed, a disturbing takeaway from the film is just how common serial rapists are. One scene depicts law enforcement officials, who have finally begun testing old rape kits, linking one rapist to two women living in completely different parts of the country. By testing the kits, police are finally catching serial offenders.  I Am Evidence  lays out the root causes of this countrywide backlog: misogyny and racism. The systemic lack of policies and protocols, of resources and funding, and \u2015 most glaringly \u2015 of training for first responders, reflects these prejudices. As with other systems that abuse and disregard marginalized people, poor black women get the worst of it.  Nobody gives a damn about women in this country,  concludes Detroit prosecutor Kym Worthy in the film. Worthy has been tackling the rape kit backlog head-on since 2009, when 11,000 untested rape kits were uncovered in her city. Adlesic said it\u2019s  absolutely necessary  for first responders to receive sexual assault training and recalled an  I Am Evidence  screening last year where a man made a powerful comment during the Q&A portion.   He was quite emotional and spoke about being an emergency room doctor. He hadn\u2019t had the training to conduct a sexual assault kit, and he was so afraid he was going to get it wrong, or make someone feel awful for not knowing how to do it,  she said.  It helped us understand that we really need to advocate for a curriculum in medical schools and law enforcement agencies so that people learn how to do this.  All too often, police officers learn the law, but no one teaches them the varying ways victims respond to trauma. Along with bringing their own prejudices to the job, officers often don\u2019t know what trauma looks like or how trauma affects memory. They also might not realize how often sexual violence triggers involuntary paralysis in a victim \u2015 an often-forgotten  freeze  component of the fight-or-flight reflex \u2015 in order to get them out of the situation alive.  Hargitay described the lack of resources to investigate these crimes, as well as cultural misunderstandings surrounding sexual violence, as a  microcosm  of how we as a country regard women.   Trish and I, we wanted to make a hard-hitting film,  she said.  It is a painful movie to watch, and it\u2019s the facts. And it\u2019s time that we take a look at not sweeping this under the carpet, that we treat women, and treat our society, and all survivors with the humanity, the empathy that they deserve.   Adlesic told HuffPost she hopes this documentary forces people to care about this issue and creates change. Most of all, she hopes this film shows survivors that they\u2019re not alone.  I want them to know that we understand, and that we care and that we want to help give them the support they need and deserve,  she said.  I want survivors to feel heard and know that they matter, and that violence against women matters, and that we walk in hand with you to a better way of life for everyone.    I Am Evidence  will air on HBO on Monday, April 16, at 8 p.m. Eastern.  "

The rival teams squared off in the seventh inning at Boston\u2019s Fenway Park on Wednesday after Yanks batter Tyler Austin charged at Red Sox pitcher Joe Kelly for throwing a ball right into his back. The scene got pretty chaotic: Kelly was retaliating for Austin\u2019s apparently late slide into second base earlier in the game that ticked off Red Sox shortstop Brock Holt, the New York Post reported. Austin cut Holt\u2019s calf with his spikes on that slide, according to MassLive. The benches cleared then as well, but mostly yelling ensued.

            "text": "UN Women, the United Nations group devoted to gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment, may need to do some internal soul-searching.  Tucked inside the organization\u2019s recent job listing seeking a  storyteller  was some boldly sexist language \u2015 a perfect example of the very kind of gender stereotyping UN Women is devoted to combating. The posting seeks an  extremely talented writer with a knack for crafting compelling content,  the listing reads. Fairly basic language \u2015 but then, under a bulleted list of responsibilities, things take a turn. After reiterating that the writer should be aligned with UN Women, the listing said  tone must be appropriate.  What tone exactly?  Witty, humorous, considerate, masculine (smart sarcasm)  [bolding ours]. After HuffPost reached out to UN Women on Wednesday afternoon, the organization removed the line.   Obviously it came across different from what we intended,  said Elizabeth Nyamayaro, who heads UN Women\u2019s HeForShe campaign, an initiative that seeks to include men in the fight for gender equality. Nyamayaro said that mission was part of the reason the  masculine  language wound up in the ad.  We are looking for someone able to communicate to a broad diverse audience and that includes men,  she said. She said going forward they would do more to monitor the language of their job listings. Nyamayaro emphasized that her group\u2019s mission is gender equality.  Discriminating against women makes absolutely no sense,  she said. She pointed out that the group has had success in pushing large companies closer to parity. Yet it is notable that even an organization committed to gender equality would make such a misstep, an indicator of how elusive the goal can be.   This posting expresses explicit, outward gender bias,  said Joelle Emerson, the founder and CEO of Paradigm, a consulting firm that works with companies on diversity and inclusion strategies to fight discrimination.  It\u2019s shocking to see the word  masculine  appear in a job description for UN Women. Even more offensive, the job posting seems to define \u2018masculine\u2019 as \u2018smart and sarcastic.\u2019  To which we say, really, UN Women? Women can\u2019t possibly be sarcastic? I mean, what with having to look pretty all the time and nurture babies and all, how could women possibly nail an edgy sarcastic tone? Only a masculine voice could possibly be talented enough to figure all this out. A woman looking for a new job sent the listing to HuffPost, saying she was taken aback by the gendered language.  When I first read the ad, I was flummoxed. It just seemed too ironic to be believed \u2015 like it was an Onion version of a job ad. I would normally be very interested in working at the U.N., the ad has certainly given me pause,  wrote the woman, who wished to remain anonymous so her current employer wouldn\u2019t know she was hunting for new work.  The thing is, I know many U.N. workers are genuinely interested in gender equality. But for this specific position, it seems like there\u2019s been some neglect, and that at least some of the people involved have a very backward view of gender. I\u2019m left wondering: Who and how many people vetted this cringe-worthy ad? How many eyes read those words and thought that the tone was just right?  Beyond the blatantly offensive wording, Emerson also pointed out that even that basic-seeming language about looking for a  talented  writer with a  knack  is problematic. The problem is that UN Women seems to be hunting for an innately talented person, not someone with a proven track record or a learner. Some research has shown that this kind of a language in a job listing can turn off female and minority candidates.  This language communicates a belief in innate abilities. You either have it or you don\u2019t,  said Emerson.  We know this type of language can deter candidates from underrepresented backgrounds.  This kind of attitude is somewhat surprising from UN Women, a well-known organization that\u2019s worked with a number of progressive entertainers and has been pushing huge companies on the issue of gender diversity. That said, the UN as a whole isn\u2019t exactly known for being particularly proactive about gender equality. Less than two years ago, the organization came under fire for making the cartoon character of Wonder Woman the honorary ambassador of its female empowerment campaign. This was before actress Gal Gadot resurrected the fictional superhero \u2015 and at a time when several women were in the running to be the first female secretary general in the organization\u2019s history. They lost out to a man. Emma Watson, the actor best known for playing feminist icon Hermione Granger in the  Harry Potter  films, was appointed the UN Women\u2019s Goodwill ambassador in 2014. That same year, she gave a widely hailed speech on gender equality to launch UN Women\u2019s  He for She  campaign, an effort to get men involved in the fight for gender equality. Watson spoke movingly of getting beyond stereotypes about men and women.  Both men and women should feel free to be sensitive. Both men and women should feel free to be strong,  she said.  It is time that we all perceive gender on a spectrum, not as two opposing sets of ideals.  "

The Olympic gymnast and sexual abuse survivor was at Louisiana State University on Wednesday night for a speaking event in partnership with the Delta Gamma sorority. Raisman discussed her book Fierce and what recovery has looked like for her since coming forward with abuse allegations against former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar.   It\u2019s OK to not be OK,  Raisman told the crowd of more than 1,000 students, The Advocate reports.  Raisman, 23, talked about testifying against Nassar in January during the former doctor\u2019s sentencing hearing. Over 260 athletes accused Nassar of serial sexual abuse under the guise of medical treatment while he was a trainer for USA Gymnastics and at Michigan State University. He received three concurrent sentences of 60 years, 40-125 years and 40-175 years in prison.  I\u2019m not as strong as I looked in those 12 or 13 minutes,  Raisman said of her now iconic impact statement, which she read aloud to Nassar in court.  I don\u2019t think people understand how much it affects me every day ... It took everything I had to be strong in that moment.   She told the crowd that some people still believe she shouldn\u2019t complain about the abuse she endured because of the gold medals she\u2019s won at past Olympics. To that, she responded:  Just because you are winning does not make abuse OK.    I think that it\u2019s important to recognize that this Me Too movement is not just in Hollywood, it\u2019s not just in gymnastics, it\u2019s not just in other sports,  Raisman continued, according to LSU\u2019s Daily Reveille.  It\u2019s everywhere, including colleges. I\u2019m not going to sit here and pretend, nor should anyone else, that sexual assault is not a very big problem on these campuses. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s talked about enough.   In a follow-up interview with The Advocate, Raisman reflected on her recent activism and what she hopes her legacy will be.   I want to be remembered for changing the way that women are looked at. I want to see women be more respected,  she said.  And I hope that one day we get to a point where everyone understands that women don\u2019t have to be modest to be respected.  Need help?

Days later, she was found dead in the woods. On Wednesday \u2015 the week she would have appeared in court \u2015 prosecutors charged the man, Quinn Anthony James, with her murder in a case that illustrates the fears some girls and women have when reporting assaults.

Witnesses said James had been searching for someone to assist him in the murder and disposal of the body, leading authorities to a Detroit man named Gerald Bennett, 58. Together, James and Bennett plotted to kill Dumbuya, Kent County Prosecutor Christopher Becker announced Wednesday. Bennett allegedly received a vehicle from James as payment. Charges against James include first-degree premeditated murder, conspiracy to commit murder, kidnapping and imprisonment, while Bennett is charged with conspiracy to commit murder. Dumbuya\u2019s original allegations against James stem from a reported sexual assault last summer in a parked car located around eight miles from her school, East Kentwood High. James had been employed as a maintenance worker for the school district until administrators learned of the alleged assault. He was fired in November, arrested, charged with four counts of criminal sexual conduct and released on bail.  Becker cited substantial evidence tying James to Dumbuya\u2019s murder, from content on the suspect\u2019s phone to forensic proof. Records placed James near the teen\u2019s home and bus stop the night before she went missing, he said. On the day of her disappearance, Jan. 24, images captured by a trail camera show a vehicle of the same type James had loaned from a dealership that same day \u2015 a black GMC Acadia \u2015  in close proximity  to where her body was found. Prosecutors allege that James lied about his whereabouts during that timeframe. Forensic evidence also  ties James to the victim\u2019s clothing,  prosecutors said. Police located the vehicle Bennett allegedly received at his girlfriend\u2019s residence in Detroit, along with video showing him with James the day before Dumbuya\u2019s disappearance. Prosecutors say James was wiring money to Bennett\u2019s girlfriend.  Fear of retaliation is often cited among reasons women and girls choose not to report sexual assault.  I used to tell them [sexual assault survivors]: That [violent retaliation] something you see on TV. That\u2019s really not going to happen,  Becker told reporters Wednesday after announcing the charges.  This is very rare, an extremely rare event, so I\u2019m not going to take the whole criminal justice system and say this is a failure.  Shortly after Dumbuya\u2019s death, James was arrested on another rape charge in a different case and is currently in jail. A GoFundMe campaign set up to cover funerary costs has raised more than $14,000, surpassing its $10,000 goal. Services were held for Dumbuya in early February. Need help?

            "text": "Score one for persistence. Andre Ingram, a graying 32-year-old with fading hopes from a decade in the minor leagues, made his NBA debut for the Los Angeles Lakers against the Houston Rockets in LA on Tuesday. He sank his first shot \u2015 a three-pointer \u2015 and kept making them. He hit 4 of his 5 three-point attempts, and was 6 of 8 from the field overall, scoring 19 points. It was the highest total in a first game by a Lakers rookie since 1993. If you don\u2019t get choked up a tad by the highlights, you need to turn in your human card. The week began routinely enough with what Ingram thought was an exit interview for the Lakers\u2019 G-league team. Instead, he got a hug from Magic Johnson and word that he was being promoted to the actual Lakers. Ingram\u2019s wife, Marilee, in Richmond, Virginia, screamed when she got the news over the telephone, the Los Angeles Times reported. Then she and their two daughters flew out to LA to watch the dream come true.  I just felt some electricity out there,  Ingram told NBA.com.  It was amazing. The crowd, the lights \u2014 it was once in a lifetime.  Ingram played 384 games in the minors on paltry salaries, earning side money as a math tutor, he told TNT. He thanked Marilee for sticking by him. The Lakers lost, 105-99, but that\u2019s so besides the point. A star was born \u2015 at least for a night \u2015 after he had waited so patiently for his chance. Ingram\u2019s call to the Lakers is the perfect bookend to the recent story of a 36-year-old accountant thrust into playing goalie for the Chicago Blackhawks in his first NHL game. Shoutouts from past and present NBA stars marked Ingram\u2019s moment. "

            "text": "When a poor person steals from the rich, Mick Mulvaney calls it a crime. When the rich steal from the poor, he calls it capitalism. On Wednesday, the White House budget director appeared before the House Financial Services Committee to deliver the semiannual report of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, of which he is also the acting head, and to dispel rumors that he might run to replace Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) as speaker of the House. Mick Mulvaney is a busy man. Or maybe not. A day before the hearing, The Associated Press reported that the CFPB has not taken a single enforcement action against any financial institution during the six months Mulvaney has been at the helm. Under his predecessor, Richard Cordray, the agency issued two to four fines and settlements per month. The CFPB has jurisdiction over payday lenders, banks, credit unions and just about any institution involved in extending credit to American families. The apparent improvement in corporate behavior beginning in November struck Democrats on the committee as an extraordinary coincidence.  Are you telling me that every single financial institution in America has suddenly snapped into full compliance with every single consumer financial law since you took over?  demanded an incredulous Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.). Mulvaney explained that the CFPB is still litigating 25 cases Cordray brought to court.  I have not burned the place down.  (That the prior director had been able to walk and chew gum simultaneously was not lost on anyone.)  During other rounds of questioning, Mulvaney emphasized that he is helping the bureau focus on  more quantitative analysis  in its work and hopes for more guidance from Congress on the meaning of the words  abusive,   deceptive  and  material  for help in writing and enforcing regulations.  When he accepted the job, Mulvaney said that President Donald Trump had told him to  fix  the CFPB and  get it back to the point where it can protect people without trampling on capitalism.  In his written statement Wednesday, he informed Congress he had developed  new strategic priorities,  including an imperative to  recognize free markets  and  take a prudent, consistent and humble approach to enforcing the law.  No one will accuse him of inconsistency. It was appropriate for Mulvaney to be defending his record on the day Ryan announced he would not run for re-election in November. Both men began their careers in Washington as leading lights of a younger generation of libertarian-leaning Republicans ferociously opposed to government spending and the regulatory state birthed by Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal. In the name of freedom, capitalism and competition, they hoped to slash programs for the poor and taxes for the rich, singing praises to the rule of law over the rule of men.  And yet both politicians have achieved their greatest purpose as agents of Trump, dutifully pressing ahead with narrow priorities while ignoring concerns about every element of their leader\u2019s program that should have frightened small-government advocates \u2015 epic military spending, violent deportations, Russian election-meddling and a soft spot for white nationalism. Their careers illustrate what the libertarian political project in America has become: an unprincipled protection racket for the rich. Ryan delivered them a smashing tax cut, while Mulvaney ensures that garden-variety predation goes uncorrected. The CFPB is charged with monitoring markets and writing new regulations where necessary, but its primary purpose is to guard against simple theft. During his tenure as director, Cordray returned $12 billion in ill-gotten gains from financial firms to American households \u2015 much of it from  undisclosed fees,   unauthorized withdrawals  and similar behavior that people who did not go to law school refer to as  theft.  For this, congressional Republicans did their best to convert him into a national pariah, and the CFPB\u2019s semiannual report to Congress became an exercise in ritualized paranoia. Last year, Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) assailed Cordray for  racism,   sexism,   intimidation,  and  retaliation,  as Republicans took turns shouting down and denouncing Cordray in a spectacle described by the notoriously radical American Banker trade newspaper as an  onslaught, during which Cordray was often denied the ability to respond.  Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) suggested Cordray\u2019s agency had aided insider trading, while Rep. Ann Wagner (R-Mo.) declared that Cordray had somehow fallen down on the job by exposing the fake accounts scandal at Wells Fargo and fining the bank $100 million.  On Wednesday, Republicans could not quite give up the tradition, even with one of their own in the hot seat. Rep. Andy Barr (R-Ky.) denounced Cordray for conspiring against  our men and women in uniform,  while committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) declared the CFPB  the single most powerful and unaccountable agency in the history of the Republic.   Few people remember the day the United States Senate confirmed Richard Cordray as the day American liberty died, and so Hensarling had to invoke a few hypothetical outrages to get the thin crowd\u2019s blood moving. The CFPB\u2019s budget is derived from the Federal Reserve rather than through the congressional appropriations process. What would happen if the CFPB approved millions of dollars to outbid AT&T for the naming rights to the Dallas Cowboys stadium? What if the CFPB sent a T-shirt to every man, woman and child in the United States? A solemn Mulvaney said that no one could stop him from engaging in such despotism if he so chose. Hensarling found the situation  borderline insane,  and it was hard to disagree with him.  Even a congressional oversight hearing for the agency did not really count as oversight. Mulvaney repeatedly insisted that the 2010 Dodd-Frank law that created the CFPB did not require him to  answer questions  or  testify  before Congress, only to  appear.  Hensarling agreed that this was a matter of very grave concern, but the GOP dropped the affair after Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) pointed out the exact same language is used in the Federal Reserve Act to compel the Fed chairman\u2019s regular reports to Congress. And yet, despite the habitually apocalyptic rhetoric from Republicans, it will likely be Democrats who deliver the most serious lasting damage to the CFPB under Trump. In March, the Senate passed a bank deregulation package that would, among other things, help banks hide racial discrimination in the mortgage market, undermine consumer protections for mobile home loans and eliminate a host of predatory lending standards for smaller banks. The bill was crafted by Senate Republicans and four Democrats \u2015 Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.), Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.) and Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), who distributed a breathtakingly dishonest  Myth vs. Fact  sheet to drum up support. Ultimately, 17 Democrats voted for the bill, including the party\u2019s 2016 vice presidential candidate, Tim Kaine (D-Va.). Unless the Republican-controlled House completely loses its collective mind, the bill will be signed into law by President Trump. The libertarian movement within the Republican Party is dead. American democracy doesn\u2019t look much healthier. "

And the tweet took off like wildfire; it currently has over 15,000 retweets. Bloom has been professionally modeling since 2014, appearing in major runway shows and making history on magazine covers (she was featured in Vogue India last year).  But she told Yahoo Lifestyle that Victoria\u2019s Secret was her  dream  company to work with.   It\u2019s always been a dream for me, like so many others, not just trans \u2014 POC, all women, and some men even,  she told the publication.  This is a platform that glorifies femininity. I always felt in my most natural state I am heavenly. For my trans sisters, regardless of color, this will be a moment for us all.  Bloom\u2019s campaign has continued to gather steam, with many supporters tweeting their well-wishes: Victoria\u2019s Secret has been under fire for years for the brand\u2019s lack of diversity, particularly in their fashion shows, when it comes to size, race and more. Fellow model Ashley Graham has been an active proponent for the show to have more of a variance in model sizes. As for trans models, Bloom isn\u2019t the first to make moves for the runway. In 2013, a Change.org petition asked Victoria\u2019s Secret to make Carmen Carrera the first transgender model for the brand. Launched by a former  RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race  contestant, Marco Regalado, the campaign hoped that Carrera\u2019s appearance on the runway would open the brand\u2019s doors to  ALL types of women.   To see a transgender model walk would show that trans women are to be taken seriously and that Angels are selected because of their character and talent,  he wrote.  As a brand, Victoria\u2019s Secret should feel comfortable marketing towards ALL types of women.  For Carrera\u2019s part, she seemed open to the idea, but nothing ever came of it. Five years later, we still haven\u2019t had a trans woman walk in the show. Perhaps Bloom\u2019s endeavor will be more successful.  Victoria\u2019s Secret did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. "

            "text": "This year, big companies in the United Kingdom were forced to do something amazing: actually reveal the difference in how men and women are paid. Thanks to a law passed last year, businesses in the U.K. that employ more than 250 workers are now required to report gender differences in both hourly wages and bonus pay. More than 10,000 companies reported data by the April 4 deadline.  The numbers were bleak, though hardly surprising. As they do all over the world, women in the U.K. make less than men. Women\u2019s median pay is close to 10 percent less than men\u2019s, the data showed. At 80 percent of businesses that reported data in the U.K., men outearn women. But the numbers revealed something else. By breaking things down by wage level, the data reveal what percentage of the best- and worst-paying roles are held by women. In doing so, they show a major reason for the pay disparity:  Women are making less not because men earn more for the same work, but because women aren\u2019t getting the best-paying jobs. At the granular level, the numbers were truly eye-popping. Men earn more than double what women make at some companies, demonstrating that when it comes to equal pay, women aren\u2019t just facing a  gap,  they\u2019re staring down a vast, dystopic hole of inequity. The male-dominated finance industry was one of the worst offenders. At Goldman Sachs in the U.K., women earn 55.5 percent less than men, according to data the company submitted. Other global finance firms in the U.K. reported similar numbers. Women at Barclays make 48 percent less on average than men. At HSBC, the gap is 59 percent. JPMorgan reported paying women 36 percent less on average. At Goldman, 83 percent of the top-paying jobs are held by men, the company\u2019s data showed. At Barclays, men represent 81 percent of the bank\u2019s top earners. Even at the U.K. outpost of Cond\u00e9 Nast, publisher of Vogue, Vanity Fair and Glamour, where women are a majority at every pay level, men still outearn women by 36.9 percent on average because of a few highly paid men sitting at the tippy top. The revelations from the U.K. shine a light on the key issue when it comes to the gender pay gap. Women don\u2019t stand a chance at pay equality if they\u2019re not making it to the top. And the findings are worth paying attention to in the U.S., especially this Tuesday, a symbolic day of the year for women. It\u2019s Equal Pay Day, the day women finally  catch up  in earnings to what men made in 2017. It\u2019s also when everyone who cares about gender equality will be offering up their take on why the pay gap exists \u2015 women earn 80 percent of what men make on average in the U.S. \u2015 and how to fix it. The companies that reported data in the U.K. offered mostly toothless solutions. In a letter to its employees, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein and its president and CEO heir apparent David Solomon acknowledged that there aren\u2019t enough women in senior roles. They\u2019re totally working on it, they said. The company is committed to having women make up 30 percent of the jobs at the vice president level and above by 2023 (that\u2019s not equality, btw). Blankfein and Solomon also are looking to have women make up half of its entry-level workforce in three years. Those goals are somewhat laudable \u2015 though awfully late in the making, since gender equality in banking is something that\u2019s been talked about for decades. Mostly they seem like PR. Big companies have been launching  women\u2019s initiatives  for a long time and still there\u2019s been little movement at the top.  For the truth about who holds the power at Goldman, just look at who was in the running to succeed Blankfein as CEO: Solomon and another man. Hardly a diverse slate of candidates. It\u2019s likely there were few suitable female candidates internally, as there are only two female executive officers out of 11 at the company.  There are far too many women and men who think the reason women aren\u2019t making it up the ladder lies with the women themselves: They  leave before they leave,  Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg once said, dialing down ambition because they want to have a family. Or they don\u2019t  lean in,  as she famously put it, placing the blame more on women for not being aggressive enough. And studies have shown clearly that women who become mothers face huge disadvantages at work because they do have to devote time to child-rearing.  However, that\u2019s only part of the reason women aren\u2019t making it up the corporate ladder. Many leave because they\u2019re sexually harassed. Others quit because they\u2019re not getting promoted by the boys\u2019 club at the top. And those promotions aren\u2019t coming, in part, because of stereotypes. The men in charge hold certain beliefs about what women want out of their careers \u2015 and often they don\u2019t bother checking to make sure their beliefs line up with reality. When she was an investment banker at JPMorgan, Sacha Nitsetska, talked to more than 100 women there, asking them what the bank could do to keep women from leaving.  The answers were very similar: increased pay transparency, clarity on career progression and bonuses, and mentorship from the seniors,  Nitsetska writes in a post for the U.K. site efinancialcareers.  But when she told senior management about her findings, she said, they did not believe her.   I was told that none of this was true and that in fact, the women are leaving because \u2018they want to raise children,\u2019  she writes. At JPMorgan in the U.K., 78 percent of the top-paying jobs are held by men. Presumably many of those men have children, but somehow they\u2019re making it work.  "

            "text": "The head of programming at HBO says that the network has examined all of its shows and corrected gender pay disparities among staff, inspired by  Big Little Lies  star and producer Reese Witherspoon and the larger Time\u2019s Up movement.  One of the things that\u2019s come out of thinking about the movement and some conversations with Reese, who\u2019s really at the forefront, is something we\u2019ve done recently,  Casey Bloys, HBO\u2019s president of programming, told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview published Monday.  We\u2019ve proactively gone through all of our shows \u2014 in fact, we just finished our process where we went through and made sure that there were no inappropriate disparities in pay; and where there were, if we found any, we corrected it going forward.   Bloys would not elaborate on which of the network\u2019s shows required adjusting pay. A spokesman for HBO declined to comment further. Witherspoon\u2019s representative did not respond to a request for comment. Other popular shows and networks have had to address similar pay gaps. Netflix\u2019s  The Crown  generated controversy when producers admitted that actress Claire Foy was paid less than male costar Matt Smith, despite Foy playing the central character.  Bloys said that pay would be commensurate with experience but that the network sought to eliminate  wildly disparate  pay, especially when a show is successful.  When you\u2019re putting a show together, people come in with different levels of experience and maybe some people have won awards or something that makes them stand out,  he said.  But when you get into season two or three of a show and the show is a success, it is much harder to justify paying people wildly disparate numbers.  Witherspoon has been an outspoken leader of Hollywood\u2019s Time\u2019s Up movement, which established a legal defense fund to assist women across all industries facing sexual harassment and other gender-related workplace injustices. The popularity and critical acclaim of  Big Little Lies  last year, which Witherspoon and costar Nicole Kidman helped bring to HBO, marked a watershed moment for shows created by and about women. Originally slated as a limited series, the show\u2019s second season will air in 2019. "

Nicolle Rochelle, an actress and activist from Little Falls, New Jersey, told People that she wanted Cosby to feel  uncomfortable  on his first day in court.  He\u2019s a man who\u2019s disempowered women\u2019s bodies for decades. It doesn\u2019t seem to be recognized,  Rochelle said.  The case is being publicized with this narrative of race. He\u2019s being painted as the victim. I wanted to emphasize that this is about rape. I wanted to make him uncomfortable and to make people think about women\u2019s bodies.   Authorities quickly apprehended Rochelle, who identified herself as part of the international women\u2019s organization Femen, and charged her with disorderly conduct, which can result in a fine. The 39-year-old had  women\u2019s lives matter  written on her chest in red and the names of Cosby\u2019s alleged victims written in black all over her body, as shown in uncensored photos taken during her arrest (below). According to IMDb, Rochelle appeared in four episodes of  The Cosby Show  between 1990 and 1992, and has also acted on shows including  Law & Order: Special Victims Unit  and  Clarissa Explains It All.   Rochelle told People that the protest had nothing to do with her time working on  The Cosby Show.  Instead, it\u2019s about the 50-plus women who have alleged the comedian drugged and sexually assaulted them.   At the moment, 61 women aren\u2019t allowed to testify against him. That\u2019s pretty appalling. The very least I could do is lend my body to this cause,  she said. She added:  There\u2019s a part of me that feels betrayed because I can understand what the victims were feeling. Like, that could have been me, I could\u2019ve undergone the abuse as well.   Cosby, 80, is charged with three counts of aggravated indecent assault for allegedly drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, a former women\u2019s basketball coach at Temple University, in 2004. In June, a jury failed to reach a unanimous decision on the charges and the judge declared a mistrial. "

            "text": "Arjan Singh Bhullar, the first Sikh fighter signed by the American mixed martial arts organization Ultimate Fighting Championship, will have another historic milestone to celebrate this week.  The 31-year-old will square off against Adam Wieczorek on Saturday in Glendale, Arizona, and wear a turban \u2015 a Sikh article of faith \u2015 as he makes his way to the ring. He\u2019ll be the first UFC fighter to do so. Gurwin Singh Ahuja, executive director of the National Sikh Campaign, told HuffPost he hopes Bhullar and his turban, also known as a dastaar, will raise awareness about the Sikh community.   A majority of Americans do not even know who Sikhs are!  Ahuja told HuffPost.  I think Bhullar\u2019s appearance will help introduce the broader public to the Sikh community, and I think his career will inform people that Sikhs are fighters and that we fight for equality.   Bhullar\u2019s upcoming fight is particularly significant as it lands on Vaisahki, a festival that observes the founding of the body of fully initiated Sikhs known as the Khalsa. Bhullar, who in his UFC debut last September also became the group\u2019s first fighter of Indian descent, hasn\u2019t always been able to showcase his pride in his heritage. He had planned to wear his turban to his initial match, but UFC policies barred that. A UFC spokesman told HuffPost that Bhullar did not follow the group\u2019s  approval process for a change in apparel. Once UFC was given more time to vet the request, approval was granted. Going forward, he will be allowed to walk to the octagon [ring] with a turban.  Bhullar told ESPN UK that the September incident  was disappointing and upsetting and frustrating.  He said that UFC officials needed  some educating and getting them on the same page, but I think we\u2019ve done that.  Bhullar, who has a 7-0 record in his bouts, has said that his identity as an Indian-Canadian Sikh is central to who he is. His grandfather arrived in Canada from India in 1959 and faced racism because of his beard and turban, the fighter told the video show MMA Hour. Bhullar\u2019s father took up wrestling as a way to protect himself at a time when the turban was not accepted, Vice Sports reported, and also used the sport as a way to connect with his peers. Bhullar himself represented Canada in wrestling at the 2012 Summer Games in London, before turning to the sport of mixed martial arts.  Considering his family\u2019s past and legacy, he said he has a duty to honor those before him.   I always try to represent, to be more than just an athlete, more than just your sport, I consider it selfish to be going in there and just fighting\u2026 So many people in my community have sacrificed for me to be in the position I\u2019m at,  Bhullar told Global News.  More than 60 percent of Americans knew nothing about Sikh Americans, a 2015 study revealed. The survey also found that when seeing someone wearing a turban, Americans were more likely to assume the individual was Muslim or Middle Eastern rather than Sikh. And according to the poll, more than half of Sikh children faced bullying in schools, with rates even more drastic for those wearing turbans.   It is frankly commonly associated with terrorism and religious extremism,  Ahuja said of the turban.  Sikhs, though, wear it as a show of commitment to values that include service, compassion, and honesty. Ahuja said that with more visibility and representation, perhaps people will  correctly associate that the person who wears a turban will fight for equality and the rights of all people.   We want UFC fans to know that ... for hundreds of years, Sikhs have fought, and many have given their lives, to protect the rights of others\u2014including Hindus, Christians, and Muslims\u2014to practice their own religions,  he said.  Ultimately, our turban represents our commitment to fight for those values.  This story has been updated with a statement from UFC.  "

            "text": "Catt Sadler is a woman on a mission. The E! News co-host resigned in December after she says she found out her male counterpart had been making  close to double  her salary. Now, she\u2019s using her experience to raise awareness of pay inequality ahead of Equal Pay Day on April 10.  Sadler talked with HuffPost, in partnership with Luna Bar, about her  highly unexpected  resignation, what it\u2019s been like to become one of the most public faces of equal pay, and how she\u2019s fighting to make sure fewer women have to go through what she did. Sadler, who worked at the entertainment network for close to a decade, hasn\u2019t let her job loss slow her down. Instead, she said it has galvanized her into action.    I\u2019m now really leaning into it because I know of the need for faces and voices and activists doing their part to make a change,  Sadler said of her newfound role.  I feel honored, in a sense. Every choice I\u2019m making and career move that I am engaging in is in line with all of this.  Sadler said she was overwhelmed by the  massive  support she received after she quit her E! job.   It really affirmed that it\u2019s not my story it is hundreds of thousands of women\u2019s stories, who are making 80 cents on the dollar compared to what men are making,  she said.  Sometimes it\u2019s worse if you\u2019re a Latina woman or a black woman \u2015 the statistics are even more glaringly bad.   White women make close to 80 cents for every white man\u2019s dollar, while Latina women make 54 cents, and black women make 63 cents, according to a 2018 report from the American Association of University Women. On average, Asian women make 87 cents to every white man\u2019s dollar.  While equal pay is an important topic, it\u2019s sometimes hard to discuss because so many factors contribute to pay inequality. Race, ethnicity, geography, age and privilege are components that can make the pay gap convoluted and complex.  To simplify the comparison, Sadler said there\u2019s one tool women in all industries can use today to combat pay inequality.   The thing that stands out the most to me is transparency. I feel like it\u2019s been so incredibly taboo, it\u2019s the one thing that is not talked about,  she said.  People walk around and nobody knows who\u2019s making what or why. You look at the sports industry and everybody knows what Tom Brady\u2019s making, right? What you make has been this dark little secret. I\u2019m a living-breathing example of that, I just had no idea.  Sadler pointed to the recent coverage of pay disparity between Hollywood stars in big films like  All The Money In The World  and Netflix\u2019s  The Crown.   I like what I see so far just in the last year of more and more news stories and things that are hitting the media and the companies that are at least responding to that,  she said.  I think companies are going to start responding in ways that they haven\u2019t been pressured to in the past, and that\u2019s huge. ... With more and more responses to what\u2019s happening, I think we\u2019ll be left with change.  Another piece of the puzzle is men. Male allies are integral in the fight, Sadler said.   I\u2019d like to hear from more guys, we\u2019re all on the same team at the end of the day,  said Sadler, who noted she\u2019s raising two boys of her own.  You know you look back at red carpet season even a little bit, and a lot of women were finally having this platform to use their voices and that was wonderful. But I would\u2019ve liked to have heard from more men. I would\u2019ve liked that question pointed at the guys. Because, again, we\u2019re all in this together. I would ask men to continue to speak up and if they\u2019re not already, please start.  Although structural changes are needed to close the pay gap, Sadler said women\u2019s livelihoods are  ultimately up to us.   I\u2019m a journalist. I\u2019m educated. I read a lot. But I wasn\u2019t even aware until it happened to me,  Sadler said of the pay gap.  So I think it\u2019s important for everybody, regardless of race or gender \u2015 the guys too \u2015 to invest enough to really become aware. Because at the end of the day, when women make more money, everybody \u2015 society as a whole \u2015 benefits.  "

In the article published on Monday, D\u00edaz describes dodging a question from a fan he met at a book signing who he refers to as  X.  According to D\u00edaz, X confronted the  This Is How You Lose Her  author about the abuse present in his novels and asked if he had experienced it himself. D\u00edaz wrote that at the time he was wearing a  mask of normalcy  and was  too scared  to answer X, who left the signing disappointed. D\u00edaz said he was haunted by the interaction. In the essay, D\u00edaz apologizes to X and finally answers the question, despite it being  years too late.  He wrote:  Yes, it happened to me. I was raped when I was eight years old. By a grownup that I truly trusted. After he raped me, he told me I had to return the next day or I would be \u2018in trouble.\u2019 And because I was terrified, and confused, I went back the next day and was raped again. I never told anyone what happened, but today I\u2019m telling you. And anyone else who cares to listen.  The Dominican-American author, who is also a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, also wrote candidly about how the rapes affected his youth, leading to depression and rage. D\u00edaz said the abuse caused him to bite his tongue in his sleep due to nightmares, fall behind in school and attempt suicide. Later in life, he experienced intimacy problems and had difficulty retaining romantic relationships. It also affected his writing. D\u00edaz cites the rapes as part of the reason for an 11-year gap between his first book,  Drown,  and the novel he won his Pulitzer for,  The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao.   It fucked up my childhood. It fucked up my adolescence. It fucked up my whole life,  he wrote.  More than being Dominican, more than being an immigrant, more, even, than being of African descent, my rape defined me. I spent more energy running from it than I did living.  D\u00edaz credits hard work in therapy for finally beginning his healing process.  After long struggle and many setbacks, my therapist slowly got me to put aside my mask,  he wrote.  Not forever, but long enough for me to breathe, to live.  "

At Saturday night\u2019s match between the Winnipeg Jets and the Chicago Blackhawks in Winnipeg, players wore jerseys with the same team name,  Broncos,  printed on their back as their nameplates.  In place of individual names, \u2018Broncos\u2019 is meant to symbolize the unity and support of our hockey communities coming together as one for the Humboldt Broncos\u2019 family,  the National Hockey League said in a press release.  Tonight, we\u2019re all Broncos,  the NHL tweeted while sharing a video of the teams\u2019 touching pre-game tribute that included a photo of the young players, aged 16 to 21, on the arena\u2019s jumbotron. Similar moments were seen before matches in cities including Edmonton, Toronto, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Boston, Philadelphia, Detroit, Nashville and Denver.  Hockey is family,  the Arizona Coyotes organization tweeted following a moment of silence during the team\u2019s match against the Anaheim Ducks. The Broncos\u2019 emblem was also seen on players\u2019 helmets, including the Toronto Maple Leafs and Las Vegas\u2019 Golden Knights.  A GoFundMe account created for the Broncos\u2019 players and family members had received more than $3 million in donations as of Sunday. The Los Angeles Kings also announced that they will donate the proceeds from their Saturday night raffle to those affected by the crash. Other teams have vowed similar donations. The Broncos\u2019 team captain, as well as nine other players, two coaches, a radio play-by-play announcer and a statistician from the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey team, were all killed in the bus crash while heading to a semifinal playoff game. One of the players killed, 21-year-old Logan Boulet, had been on life support up until Saturday night. His family later shared that his organs would be donated to help at least six different people.  Logan made it clear previously that he signed his donor card as soon as he turned 21. Even in his eventual passing, he will be a selfless hero,  his family said in a statement obtained by Canada\u2019s Global News. "

During one of his self-help lectures last month in San Jose, California, Robbins suggested that proponents of the movement to end sexual harassment and assault were failing to take responsibility for their own actions. Tarana Burke, who created the #MeToo hashtag, slammed Robbins in a series of tweets Saturday.  This moment is so damaging especially with how influential @TonyRobbins is,  Burke tweeted.  His misogyny runs deep.  Robbins, a wildly popular motivational speaker, attempted to clarify his comments in a statement Sunday, calling the Me Too movement a  beautiful force for good.   My comments failed to reflect the respect I have for everything Tarana Burke and the #MeToo movement has achieved,  Robbins said in the statement.  I apologize for suggesting anything other than my profound admiration for the #MeToo movement.   It is clear that I still have much to learn,  he added. A video of Robbins controversial remarks went viral after Burke weighed in on them Saturday. In the video, a woman identified as Nanine McCool is seen confronting Robbins over his stance on the Me Too movement.  I think you misunderstand the Me Too movement. I think \u2015  McCool says before Robbins cuts her off.  I\u2019m not mocking the Me Too movement. I\u2019m mocking victimhood,  Robins said.  Look at these people and see what is empowerment. Anger is not empowerment.   What you\u2019re seeing is people making themselves significant by making somebody else wrong,  he continued.  And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that \u2015 it just won\u2019t make you happy. It won\u2019t make them better. It won\u2019t make you better.   "

            "text": "UPDATE: April 10 \u2015 Tony Robbins issued an apology Sunday afternoon to say his comments  failed to reflect the respect I have for everything Tarana Burke and the #MeToo movement has [sic] achieved.   \u2033[S]ometimes, the teacher has to become the student and it is clear that I still have much to learn,  Robbins continued in the statement, which did not address his praise of a male client who declined to hire a qualified woman on the basis of her good looks. Actress Jessica Chastain, an outspoken advocate of gender equality, seemingly criticized that moment from Robbin's March event over Twitter on Tuesday.    If you don\u2019t hire a qualified interviewee because of fear that you\u2019ll be tempted to sexually harass her, perhaps you should consider speaking to a mental health expert about impulse control,  she wrote.  PREVIOUSLY:  Something amazing happened during one of Tony Robbins\u2019 huge self-help lectures \u2015 but it was not his doing.   A woman identified as Nanine McCool stood up in the audience to call out Robbins\u2019 take on the Me Too movement in San Jose, California, last month after he tried to characterize some of its proponents as people who don\u2019t take responsibility for themselves. Robbins also bizarrely championed a man who chose not to hire a qualified female applicant because of her looks. As video of the event began circulating on social media, Tarana Burke \u2015 who created the #MeToo hashtag \u2015 chimed in herself.   I was made aware of this video BEFORE I ever saw it because Tony Robbins\u2019 people reached out to do damage control within 24 hours,  Burke said over Twitter.  They wanted to \u2018give me context\u2019 apparently. I don\u2019t need any. I have eyes. The full video is 11 mins. And it\u2019s gross. Bravo to this woman.  Some on Twitter replied saying the full six-hour event cast Robbins\u2019 comments in a different light, but Burke was still not convinced.  His misogyny runs deep,  she continued in her series of tweets, going on to explain exactly what the movement was all about \u2015 not victimhood, but survivors.  Robbins made a name for himself in the \u201980s and \u201990s by authoring a series of self-help books. He now tours the world giving lectures and has been featured on the Oprah Winfrey Network. McCool, handed a microphone, attempted to voice her concern over Robbins\u2019  mischaracterization  of the Me Too movement during the event while the life coach repeatedly drowned her out.   I\u2019m not knocking the Me Too movement,  Robbins said, claiming that McCool\u2019s explanation was simply her own  experience.   I\u2019m knocking victimhood,  Robbins said.  What you\u2019re seeing is people making themselves significant by making somebody else wrong,  he continued, before invoking Jesus, stones and glass houses.  Still, McCool calmly tried to tell Robbins that many of the movement\u2019s proponents are advocating for safety at home and at work, to create environments that are free from sexual harassment and violence.  I think you do the whole movement a disservice,  she said.  Robbins then tried using McCool to illustrate his argument, pushing his fist against her fist in a spectacle made more uncomfortable given the so-called guru\u2019s towering 6-foot, 7-inch stature.   When you push someone else, it doesn\u2019t make you more safe. It just makes them angry,  he said.  ( It\u2019s awareness. It\u2019s not pushing,  a voice near the source of the video can be heard saying in response.) Robbins then shared a story about a  very famous man, very powerful man  who seemed to illegally decline to hire a woman because, even though she was the most qualified candidate, he considered her good looks a liability.  Burke had something to say about that, too: HuffPost reached out to a representative for Robbins but did not receive an immediate response.  See the moment below: "

If any reader has a mind to take up golf, just watch one of the game\u2019s best players crumble out of contention in a hurry. Garc\u00eda, of Spain, came into the 15th hole at one over par while competing at Georgia\u2019s Augusta National Golf Club. In the end, he required 13 strokes for the par-5 hole, tying for the worst score ever on one hole at the tournament, ESPN noted. He hit the ball into the water five straight times at one point.   I don\u2019t know what to tell you,  he said afterward.  It\u2019s one of those things. It\u2019s the first time in my career where I make a 13 without missing a shot. Simple as that.

            "text": "Twitter announced Thursday that it has suspended more than 1.2 million accounts since August 2015 to the end of 2017 for  terrorist content.  In the latest six-month reporting period, ending Dec. 31, Twitter permanently suspended 274,460 accounts for  violations related to the promotion of terrorism,  the company revealed in a blog post detailing highlights from its 12th biannual Twitter Transparency Report. Twitter began major suspensions of terrorist-related accounts in early 2014 in the wake of criticism that it wasn\u2019t doing enough. Last year, relatives of victims of the 2015 San Bernardino, California, terrorist attack that killed 14 people filed a federal lawsuit against Twitter, Google and Facebook, accusing the tech giants of supporting Islamic State. The suit claims the companies allowed Islamic State to build an outsized online presence to draw recruits. Twitter\u2019s latest suspension count was down 8.4 percent from 299,649 suspensions in the previous six-month reporting period and down 27 percent from the last half of 2016. Of the blocked accounts in the latest period, 93 percent were spotted by internal company tracking tools and 74 percent were cut before the first tweet appeared, Twitter reported.  Twitter credits better in-house tech tools for those declines in suspensions.  We continue to see the positive, significant impact of years of hard work making our site an undesirable place for those seeking to promote terrorism, resulting in this type of activity increasingly shifting away from Twitter,  the company said.  Government reports of violations related to terrorism represented less than 0.2 percent \u2014 597 accounts \u2014 of all suspensions in the most recent reporting period, according to Twitter. A far larger number of Twitter accounts were reported by government agencies (including police departments) for  abusive  behavior \u2014 including hate speech, racism, sexism and other types of trolling, which Twitter has been harshly criticized for failing to police. Government agencies reported 6,254 Twitter accounts in the last half of 2017 for abusive behavior, but the company took action against only a quarter of those accounts. Abusive content continues to be a particular problem for Twitter overseas, where laws more sharply restrict hate speech and trolling. A new European Commission regulation last month called on social media platforms to remove illegal content within an hour of it being reported.  In the fourth quarter of last year, Twitter reported 330 million average monthly users of its platform. "

            "text": "A woman who accused a former Mormon leader of rape filed a civil lawsuit against the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on Wednesday, claiming the church did not properly respond when she reported the abuse decades ago. McKenna Denson, 55, says she was raped in 1984 by Joseph L. Bishop, the former president of a Mormon missionary training center (MTC) in Provo, Utah. Denson said she told local Mormon leaders about the assault numerous times over the years, but that the church failed to take action against the leader. Instead, she says, Bishop was allowed to continue holding leadership positions that placed him in charge of hundreds of Mormon youth.  Denson said that after trying to seek justice through the church for three decades, she\u2019s  absolutely prepared  to fight it in court.   I\u2019m ready for this,  Denson said Thursday during a press conference in Salt Lake City.  I\u2019ve been ready. I think what makes me feel even more confident [is], I\u2019m right. It happened. I was raped at the MTC. The church covered it up, and they still promoted him to higher and higher positions of the church.  Bishop, who is now 85 years old, denies the rape allegations. In an interview with police last year, he admitted that he had taken Denson to a small  preparation room  at the center and  asked her to show him her breasts, which she did.   Church spokesman Eric Hawkins told HuffPost in an email that the church is confident that the legal system will ensure a just result in this case.  Our hearts ache for all survivors of abuse, and the Church is committed to addressing incidents of abuse wherever they are found,  Hawkins wrote.  As this is now an active legal matter, we are unable to make further comment at this time.  In a previous statement, the church claimed that it did not impose formal discipline on Bishop because it was unable to verify the allegations against him. The church said it is investigating the alleged rape again and would take action against Bishop if it found the claims to be true. Denson\u2019s lawsuit names Bishop and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as defendants, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. Denson\u2019s lawyer, Craig Vernon, said his client is seeking to hold Bishop accountable and that he hopes the lawsuit will also reveal systematic problems the church\u2019s handling of abuse allegations. On March 26, the church updated its guidelines on abuse prevention. The guidelines instruct church leaders to call a church helpline when they learn of possible abuse cases. The helpline reportedly connects the leaders to  legal and clinical professionals  who provide instructions on how to assist victims and comply with local requirements about reporting abuse.  Denson also brought up the church\u2019s longheld practice of allowing local leaders, known as bishops, to conduct one-on-one  worthiness  interviews with young children. Some parents have complained that bishops are able to ask children invasive questions about their sexuality during these interviews.  The interviews have recently become a controversial subject in the Mormon church. Last week, about 1,000 people marched to the church\u2019s headquarters to demand an end to the practice and make it a requirement for a parent or guardian to sit in on the interviews. The church\u2019s updated abuse guidelines make this an option, not a requirement. In response to a petition from concerned Mormon parents, Hawkins, the church spokesman, issued a statement last December defending bishops\u2019 interviews as an important part of the church\u2019s ministry.  Denson said Bishop was able to groom her for abuse because she had already gotten used to the idea that it was OK to be alone in a room with an older man who asked her sexually explicit questions. She said the movement to change the church\u2019s policies on bishop\u2019s interviews was  absolutely vital  to her.  If I had been taught early on that it was not OK to be alone, one on one with a priesthood leader, no matter how high up he is, I honestly believe this would not have happened,  she said. "

The UFC star was charged with assault and criminal mischief after he threw a hand dolly through the window of a bus transporting other fighters, police told HuffPost. The incident was caught on video: Two competitors, Michael Chiesa and Ray Borg, suffered facial or eye injuries that will keep them out of Saturday\u2019s pay-per-view event at Barclays Center in the New York City borough, the UFC said.  The organization said it withdrew another competitor from the schedule, McGregor teammate Artem Lobov, because of his alleged participation in the mayhem, forcing the cancelation of the event\u2019s third bout. A peeved McGregor showed up unexpectedly to a Barclays press event for the matches after the UFC announced it would strip him of his 155-pound title, the New York Post reported. McGregor, who lost to Floyd Mayweather Jr. in a much-hyped boxing match in August, hadn\u2019t fought in the UFC since 2016. Khabib Nurmagomedov and Max Holloway were supposed to fight for McGregor\u2019s title on Saturday but that bout was canceled as well after doctors declared Holloway  unfit to fight.  McGregor and his entourage reportedly set upon the bus with Nurmagomedov inside.  Conor went bananas and put a beating on the van that we were in looking for Khabib,  Rick Little, a coach of one of the injured fighters, told MMA Junkie.  A million security guards had to restrain him.  McGregor surrendered to police late Thursday without incident, an NYPD spokesperson said to HuffPost. UFC president Dana White said in a video that McGregor and 20 or so men also threw trash cans while the buses were pulling out of the loading docks. He called McGregor\u2019s behavior and that of his entourage  the most disgusting thing that has ever happened in the history of the company.   "

In light of China\u2019s  unfair retaliation  against earlier U.S. trade actions, Trump upped the ante on Thursday by ordering U.S. officials to identify extra tariffs, escalating a high stakes tit-for-tat confrontation with potentially damaging consequences for the world\u2019s two biggest economies. On Wednesday, China unveiled a list of 106 U.S. goods - from soybeans and whiskey to frozen beef and aircraft - targeted for tariffs, in a swift retaliatory move only hours after the Trump administration proposed duties on some 1,300 Chinese industrial, technology, transport and medical products. Washington has called for the $50 billion in extra duties after it said a probe determined Chinese government policies are designed to transfer U.S. intellectual property to Chinese companies and allow them to seize leadership in key high-technology industries of the future. Responding to Trump\u2019s latest comments, the Chinese commerce ministry reiterated that Chinawas not afraid of a trade war even though it did not seek one, and accused the United States of provoking the conflict.  If the United States disregards the objections of China and the international community and persists in unilateralism and trade protectionism, the Chinese side will follow through to the end, at any cost, and definitely fight back resolutely,  a spokesperson was quoted as saying in a statement on the ministry\u2019s website. The ministry has called for a media briefing on Friday night, in an unusual move on a public holiday. Earlier in the day, Chinese state media had slammed Trump\u2019s threat of more trade action as  ridiculous.   This latest intimidation reflects the deep arrogance of some American elites in their attitude towards China,  the state-run Global Times said in an editorial. While Beijing\u2019s claims that Washington is the aggressor and is spurring global protectionism, China\u2019s trading partners have complained for years that it abuses World Trade Organization rules and propagates unfair policies at home that lock foreign firms out of some sectors as domestic champions are being nurtured. China has repeatedly vowed that it would open up sectors such as financial services. President Xi Jinping next week is expected to unveil fresh measures on reform and his country\u2019s opening up at the high-profile Boao Forum, China\u2019s equivalent of Davos, in the southern island province of Hainan.   While China has projected an image of multilateralism and restraint amid the escalating trade dispute with the United States, Beijing has been swift to respond to Washington\u2019s rhetoric and actions. So far, U.S. information technology products from mobile phones to personal computers have largely escaped the ire of Beijing, as well as telecoms equipment and aircraft larger than the equivalent of a Boeing 737. Among the most affected by a trade war could be the U.S. technology sector, particularly chipmakers. The U.S. semiconductor sector relies on China for about a quarter of its revenue. It also remains to be seen if the trade dispute would trigger a nationalistic travel backlash. When ties between Beijing and Seoul chilled, Chinese tourism to South Korea plummeted and Made-in-South Korea products were shunned by consumers in China. On Chinese social media on Friday, among the most searched phrases were  China hasn\u2019t grown up afraid  and  China will follow through to the end.    Analysts at Oxford Economics warned that a full-blown trade war will have damaging consequences.  Importantly, these threatened tariffs will be subject to negotiation, and therefore shouldn\u2019t be considered as final,  the analysts wrote in a note to client.  A (full-blown) trade war meanwhile would have a more pronounced effect. The U.S. and Chinawould suffer significant slowdown in real GDP growth \u2013 a cumulative loss around 1.0 percentage point,  and cut global economic growth to 2.5 percent in 2019 from 3.0 percent in Oxford\u2019s baseline scenario. The escalating tit-for-tat trade actions between the two economic superpowers have roiled global financial markets, as investors worried about the impact on world trade and growth, hitting equities, the dollar and a range of riskier assets such as copper and boosting safe-havens such as the Japanese yen and gold. The dollar fell in Friday\u2019s trade, while U.S. stock futures and most of Asia\u2019s stock markets were in the red.  This is what a trade war looks like, and what we have warned against from the start,  said National Retail Federation President and CEO Matthew Shay.  We are on a dangerous downward spiral and American families will be on the losing end,  Shay added in a statement, urging Trump  to stop playing a game of chicken with the U.S. economy.

            "text": "Victoria Higgins wants you to know that she\u2019s not a jealous psychopath, she\u2019s just a writer who needed to meet a deadline. The 22-year-old Missouri State University senior writes a weekly column for The Odyssey, a website that posts blogs targeted to various colleges and universities. Last week, she was suffering writer\u2019s block until she remembered a conversation she had with a friend a week or so earlier.  A friend of mine whose boyfriend\u2019s dad died when he was in high school said she wished she could have loved and supported him when that happened,  Higgins told HuffPost.  Higgins, who is engaged to be married in May to her boyfriend Brandon, mentioned she wishes she had been able to attend prom with him back in high school.  I grew up in a small town. There was maybe a 100 people at prom,  she said.  Prom sucked.  Higgins turned that germ of an idea into a now-viral post titled,  You May Have Worn The Prom Dress With Him, But I Get To Wear The Wedding Dress.  Higgins said she wrote the post in the character of an engaged woman speaking to her fiance\u2019s high school girlfriend. This excerpt will give you a hint about the tone of the piece:  You thought that you would marry your boyfriend and you thought that everything would work out how you had always imagined. I don\u2019t blame you though. He\u2019s great. You wanted everything with him, but you were just not right for him. Higgins explains that she didn\u2019t write the piece from her direct life, but was merely putting herself in the mindset of a woman who might feel this way.  It\u2019s not directly from me,  she said.  I was trying to reach a certain group and things they can relate to.  The blog was posted Tuesday night, and Higgins says it was well received by the Missouri State University group it targeted.  But things changed after it was posted on the main Odyssey page.  People didn\u2019t understand it and it turned into hate,  she said. The article inspired a lot of criticism on Twitter: Higgins said she was unprepared for the reaction.  There\u2019s been an insane amount of cyberbullying,  she said.  If I didn\u2019t have a support system, I couldn\u2019t take it.  The worst part, she said, is how people have gone after her boyfriend.  People are messaging him saying, \u2018Run for the hills,\u2019  she said.  He\u2019s not doing good, but he knows who I am, not what the internet is saying.  Although Higgins insists the article isn\u2019t a diary from her life, she admits she may not have added enough context or explanation in her rush to make a deadline. Still, she says there are women who do relate to her blog, and they have a right to feel the way they do.  Just because someone doesn\u2019t feel the way you do, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re psycho,  she said.  That\u2019s why I haven\u2019t taken the article down.  "

One of Edelman\u2019s Instagram followers sent him a direct message on March 25, according to the team, alerting the football player to a threatening message in the comments section of one of his posts.  Dude there is a kid in your comment section saying he s [sic] going to shoot up a school, i [sic] think you should alert the authority,  a screenshot of the comment read. Edelman contacted Moen, who found the comment posted beneath a photo Edelman had shared of himself and former teammate Danny Amendola.  I\u2019m going to shoot my school up watch the news,  the comment read, according to The New York Times. Moen contacted authorities, who responded quickly and traced the comment back to a house in Port Huron, Michigan. An article on the Patriots\u2019 website said a 14-year-old boy had confessed to police that he wrote the threat. He was taken to a juvenile detention center and charged with making a false report of a threat of terrorism. Two rifles belonging to the boy\u2019s mother were found in the home. In an interview with the Times, Edelman thanked the fan who alerted him to the threatening message. He also spoke of how the Parkland school shooting has continued to occupy his thoughts. Last month, the Patriots loaned the team\u2019s plane out to fly families of the Parkland victims, as well as students injured in the attack, from Florida to Washington, D.C., so they could attend the March For Our Lives protests. Seventeen students and educators were killed in the Feb. 14 mass shooting. "

Bahram Hojreh, 42, has been accused of sexually abusing seven of the athletes he coached at the International Water Polo Club in Los Alamitos, California, between September 2014 and January 2018, according to The Associated Press. Four of the seven girls were 15 or younger during the time the abuse allegedly took place.  The alleged abuse happened during one-on-one coaching sessions, according to court documents.  Officials told the AP that Hojreh is accused of digitally penetrating the girls, touching their breasts and genitals, and pressuring them to touch his genitals. Hojreh, who has been involved in the water polo world for over two decades, is facing more than 20 felony and misdemeanor charges including sexual battery, sexual penetration by foreign object of a minor, child annoyance and lewd acts upon a child. Hojreh\u2019s attorney, Ricardo Nico, said Wednesday during an arraignment in the Orange County Superior Court that Hojreh  adamantly denies  the allegations, the Orange County Register reported.  Christopher Ramsey, the CEO of USA Water Polo, told HuffPost that Hojreh was immediately suspended from his coaching position when the organization learned of the allegations in January. Hojreh\u2019s membership to the organization was also revoked, and he was suspended from the board of directors for the South California chapter of USA Water Polo.   USA Water Polo has zero tolerance for sexual misconduct,  Ramsey said. The allegations were initially reported to the U.S. Center for SafeSport in January. Ramsey said USA Water Polo will support the organization in its investigation efforts.  Hojreh was released on a $250,000 bond and is set to appear in court for a pretrial hearing on June 14.  Neither Hojreh nor the International Water Polo Club immediately responded to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.  Sexual abuse in Olympic and amateur sports has dominated headlines over the last few months. Former USA Gymnastics doctor and Michigan State University trainer Larry Nassar was accused of sexually abusing over 260 athletes under the guise of medical treatment. He received three concurrent sentences of 60 years, 40 to 125 years and 40 to 175 years in prison on child sexual abuse and child pornography charges. Additionally, the Southern California News Group published an explosive report in February revealing that USA Swimming has covered up hundreds of sexual abuse cases over the years. "

            "text": "USA Taekwondo coach Jean Lopez was banned from the sport on Tuesday night following multiple allegations of sexual misconduct.  Lopez, 44, is accused of sexually assaulting four female taekwondo athletes dating back to 1997, according to a report from the U.S. Center for SafeSport obtained by NPR. He had a  decades-long pattern of sexual misconduct  and allegedly used his authority as a coach to  groom, manipulate, and ultimately, sexually abuse younger female athletes,  the report states.   Given the number of incidents reported over a span of several years and by multiple reporting parties, most of whom have no reasonable motive to fabricate an allegation \u2015 much less multiple, distinct incidents \u2015 of misconduct, the totality of the circumstances clearly shows a recurrent pattern of behavior on the part of Jean,  reads another part of the report, according to USA Today.  Lopez coached the U.S. Olympic taekwondo team between 2004 and 2016, through four Olympic games. Most notably, he coached his younger brother Steven Lopez, 39, the most decorated and best-known American athlete in the sport. Steven Lopez \u2015 who won two Olympic gold medals, a bronze medal and five world championships \u2015 has separately been accused of rape by two women.  HuffPost reached out to both Jean and Steven Lopez for comment but did not immediately hear back from either. Both men have previously denied all allegations against them. Jean Lopez also trained two other younger siblings, Diana and Mark Lopez, who competed on the Olympic level as well.  The former coach was declared  permanently ineligible  as of April 3, according to SafeSport\u2019s website. Permanently ineligible is defined by SafeSport as  permanently prohibited from participating in any capacity in any activity or competition authorized by, organized by, or under the auspices of the United States Olympic Committee, the national governing bodies recognized by the USOC, and/or a Local Affiliated Organization of a national governing body recognized by the USOC.   A spokesperson for SafeSport declined to comment further on Lopez\u2019s ineligibility.  Heidi Gilbert, a former taekwondo fighter who trained under Lopez, told NPR that he had sexually assaulted her after she won a gold medal in the Pan American Games in Ecuador in 2002, when she was 19. Gilbert said Lopez drugged and assaulted her again a year later while the two were in Germany for the World Championships.   I am relieved and excited that he will no longer be able to coach young athletes or manipulate girls in these kinds of settings,  Gilbert told USA Today, adding that she\u2019s still  highly disappointed  that the process took so long to penalize Lopez.  Another elite taekwondo fighter, Mandy Meloon, filed a formal complaint against Lopez with USA Taekwondo in 2006. According to Meloon, Lopez inappropriately touched her in 1997 when she was underage while the two were traveling internationally for a competition. Meloon was also in a long-term relationship with Steven Lopez and claims that he physically abused and raped her multiple times. USA Taekwondo opened an investigation into the sexual assault allegations against Jean and Steven Lopez three years ago, but little was done. Both brothers were allowed to participate in the 2016 Rio Olympics. It wasn\u2019t until the two cases were handed over to the U.S. Center for SafeSport in March of last year that action was taken. SafeSport declined to comment on the current status of Steven Lopez\u2019s case, according to NPR. Steve McNally, the executive director of USA Taekwondo, declined to comment about the allegations against Jean Lopez. He told HuffPost,  Unfortunately we can\u2019t comment beyond what\u2019s been published on our suspension list at this time. As the decision is still subject to appeal it would be inappropriate to comment further until due process is concluded.  The U.S. Center for SafeSport was created in 2017 to investigate all sexual abuse complaints in amateur Olympic sports organizations. The nonprofit center was launched in response to the Larry Nassar scandal in the gymnastics world and various other systemic issues of sexual abuse in Olympic sports.  "

            "text": "Women in China are covertly resisting government crackdowns on discussions over their Me Too movement with a clever workaround. The phrase  rice bunny  (\u7c73\u5154), pronounced as  mi tu,  has popped up on social media networks after censors removed posts that mentioned sexual harassment or the hashtag #MeToo. While those phrases are heavily monitored, Rice Bunny isn\u2019t. In addition to the rice and bunny emojis, social media users also use the phrase in popular hashtags #\u7c73\u5154\u4e0d\u80fd\u5fd8# ( Rice Bunny Never Forget ) and #\u7c73\u5154\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd# ( Rice Bunny In China ). Social media users have used them in campaigns, forums and various accounts on platforms like Weibo and WeChat to discuss topics such as opportunity inequality, domestic violence and sexual harassment. The new phrase is harder for censors to follow, as  rice  and  bunny  are both common enough words that banning them from a platform would be too difficult. One recent post on Weibo that uses the hashtags calls on others to stand up to gender inequality, fight discrimination and violence, and criticizes the censoring of feminist messages, according to a HuffPost translation. Another post shows a woman holding a sign that reads,  The fight against sexual harassment is far more important than shopping.  The feminist movement in China experienced a resurgence in the past few years, particularly among the younger generations, oftentimes drawing influence from Western countries. But the rise of feminism has amplified the country\u2019s complicated relationship with gender equality.  Women in China, particularly from urban areas, have seen considerable job mobility in recent decades in certain industries like tech. Almost 80 percent of companies have women in top positions, according to The Atlantic. To compare, about half of U.S. tech companies employ women in such spots. And in December 2015, the country passed its first legislation against domestic violence \u2015 a landmark law for China. But much like the slew of other social and political movements, like the 2014 Umbrella Revolution and the pro-democracy protests of 2011, feminism has been met with resistance from the government. In one of the most high-profile cases, Beijing police arrested and detained five gender equality activists, known as the  Feminist Five,  in 2015 for planning to stage protests against sexual harassment.  The #MeToo movement in China was largely inspired by Luo Xixi, a former student who shared an online essay describing being sexually assaulted by Chen Xiaowu, a professor at Beihang University. Chen was quickly fired after Luo\u2019s piece went viral and an investigation found he\u2019d had a history of sexual harassment. Her piece prompted lengthy debates about sexual harassment on Weibo and other online platforms. Since then, however, popular Weibo accounts #MeToo and Feminist Voices have been suspended several times due to their criticism of gender inequality in Chinese society. Profiles and hashtags on Chinese social media continue to be monitored and frequently taken down. Yet with the shutdown of each profile, new ones under different monikers are launched. The creative Rice Bunny hashtags are just another example of the resilience inside China\u2019s feminist movement.   Chinese women feel very unequal every day of their lives, and the government cannot make women oblivious to the deep injustice they feel,  Lu Pin, the founding editor of Feminist Voices, told NPR after the account was put on a 30-day ban.  The feminist movement is about building a community to address women\u2019s everyday concerns.  In the past, activists have used wordplay to both avoid China\u2019s censorship and even criticize it. In 2009, social media users used  grass-mud horse  \u2015 a phrase that\u2019s pronounced similarly to the Chinese words for  fuck your mother  \u2015 to convey opposition to internet censorship.  River crab,  which is pronounced similarly to the Chinese phrase for harmony, became a euphemism for censorship itself. Online users who\u2019d been censored could tell others that their posts had been  harmonized.  John Zhou helped with translations for this post.  "

            "text": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wants you to know he\u2019s super sorry. And for the most part it really does seem like he means it \u2015 so long as apologizing and trying to earn back users\u2019 trust doesn\u2019t cut into company profits. On Wednesday afternoon, the social media company made its founder available for questions from the media shortly after it announced plans to restrict who can access user data and to clarify how it uses that data in the first place. At the same time, Facebook also increased its estimate of users whose data was harvested and shared with the political research firm Cambridge Analytica, from 50 million to as many as 87 million. Needless to say, there was plenty to talk about. Here\u2019s a brief rundown of the bigger points of the conversation: Zuckerberg said he expects the company will revise and reassess the extent of Russia\u2019s misinformation campaign and that its numbers will undoubtedly grow.  There is going to be more content that we\u2019re going to find over time,  he said.  As long as there are people employed in Russia who have the job of trying to find a way to exploit these systems, this is going to be a never-ending battle. You never fully solve security; it\u2019s an arms race.  He acknowledged Facebook was  behind  during the 2016 election and said the company plans to hire 20,000 people by the end of the year to focus on content screening and security efforts. There hasn\u2019t been any  meaningful impact  by the movement, he said, but the company does take seriously the underlying sentiment that\u2019s driving it.  Even if we can\u2019t measure a change, it still speaks to people feeling like this is a massive breach of trust.   Facebook took Cambridge Analytica at its word that the company had, in fact, deleted the data harvested from up to 87 million users \u2015 and maybe it should have followed up to verify it was actually deleted. Zuckerberg didn\u2019t rule out the possibility of legal action against Cambridge Analytica but said Facebook will do a full audit first to determine what happened to the data and when. That said, he acknowledged Facebook can\u2019t just pass the blame onto Cambridge Analytica, as Facebook\u2019s tools enabled its behavior in the first place.  I think we understand that we need to take a broader view of our responsibility,  Zuckerberg said.  We\u2019re not just building tools, but we need to take full responsibility for the outcomes of how people use those tools as well.   Knowing what I know today, clearly we should\u2019ve done more, and we will going forward.  He\u2019s into it, with some reservations. Asked specifically if he\u2019d be willing to implement new privacy policies in the U.S. similar to the strict new privacy laws rolling out in the European Union, Zuckerberg said he was comfortable with the idea but not in the same format. When the EU law takes effect on May 25, Facebook will have to get users\u2019 explicit consent to collect data and be much more upfront about how it uses that data. Zuckerberg said Facebook  intends to make the same controls and settings available everywhere, not just in Europe.  That\u2019s subject to some flexibility, however \u2015 a variation he attributed to a patchwork of global laws on the matter. Two reporters asked variations of this question, and it seemingly caught him off guard the first time. The second time he unhesitatingly said yes, portraying the company\u2019s recent stumbles more as learning opportunities than far-reaching mistakes.  When you\u2019re building something like Facebook that is unprecedented in the world, there are going to be things that you mess up. And if we\u2019d gotten this right, we would\u2019ve messed something else up. I don\u2019t think anyone is going to be perfect. But I think what people should hold us accountable for is learning from the mistakes and continually doing better and continuing to evolve what our view of our responsibility is.  Nope. Zuckerberg disputed the premise of the question, portraying a more profitable Facebook as one that\u2019s fundamentally more useful to people. As the site gets better at targeting users with more-relevant ads, the more profitable it will be.  People tell us that if they\u2019re going to see ads, they want the ads to be good. Like most of the hard decisions we have to make, this is one where there\u2019s a trade-off between values that people care about. On the one hand, people want relevant experiences, and on the other hand, I do think there\u2019s some discomfort with how data is used in systems like ads. But I think the feedback is overwhelmingly on the side of wanting a better experience.  Zuckerberg broke this into three distinct categories, each to be combated via different initiatives by the company. The first category of bad actors he summed up as spammers who craft sensationalistic fake stories. People click, the stories spread rapidly despite being false and the author \u2015 often located in Macedonia \u2015 makes money. Simple artificial intelligence measures have helped curb this type of economically driven content. The second category belongs to Russian agents and other government actors who are interfering with and attempting to influence the outcome of an election. Zuckerberg acknowledged this is more difficult to combat \u2015 especially because it mimics and can be indistinguishable from legitimate political discussion. Facebook is making progress here, with moderate successes in the French and German elections, but Zuckerberg cautioned it will be a  multi-year effort.  And the third category he identified tracks back to political polarization in society itself. That shows up on Facebook when highly biased media outlets present a larger picture that  isn\u2019t really true even if the specific facts might be.  Zuckerberg said the site is seeking to counter by promoting  broadly trusted journalism  that does a  fair and thorough  job. "

Hilarious ladies on Twitter are having a whole lot of fun with a challenge that asked them to describe themselves the way a male author would. Late last week, young adult author Gwen Katz was reading a Twitter conversation sparked by #ownvoices, a hashtag created to recommend YA and children\u2019s books about  diverse characters written by authors from that same diverse group.  While reading the conversation, Katz stumbled upon one male author who insisted he could write female characters authentically. Katz proved that the anonymous writer was incredibly clueless by posting a few lines from his novel. It read:  I sauntered over, certain he noticed me. I\u2019m hard to miss, I\u2019d like to think \u2013 a little tall (but not too tall), a nice set of curves if I do say so myself, pants so impossibly tight that if I had had a credit card in my back pocket you could read the expiration date.

Donte DiVincenzo came off the bench to pour in a game-high 31 points and lead the Wildcats their second NCAA Tournament championship in three seasons, a workmanlike 79-62 beating of Michigan at the Alamodome in San Antonio. Mikal Bridges added 19 for Villanova, which overcame an early deficit with a late first-half run fueled by DiVincenzo before pulling away in the second half behind more balanced contributions and its underrated defense. The Wildcats (36-4) became the first team since North Carolina in 2015 to lead the country in scoring and win the national title. The 2009 Tar Heels were the last team to win every tourney game by double digits. Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman scored 23 points for the Wolverines (33-8) and Moritz Wagner hit for 16, but they didn\u2019t have enough help. Michigan made just 43.6 percent of its field-goal tries and went a paltry 3 of 23 from the 3-point arc. After Wagner scored the first bucket of the second half, the Wildcats left no doubt about their superiority. They went on a 14-3 run that Bridges capped with a 3-pointer for a 51-33 advantage with 14:36 remaining. The lead never dipped below 12 for the game\u2019s remainder as Villanova answered every little Wolverines run with a bucket here, a couple of 3-pointers there. DiVincenzo rattled off nine consecutive points in a 2:39 span, giving the Wildcats a 62-44 cushion with 7:57 left. Michigan rode Wagner and Abdur-Rahkman to an early lead. The senior duo scored the team\u2019s first 16 points \u2015 Wagner had nine \u2015 as the Wolverines opened a 16-11 cushion at the 12:26 mark of the first half when Abdur-Rahkman drove for a layup. Meanwhile, Villanova found during the first 12 minutes that it wasn\u2019t going to solve Michigan\u2019s defense as easily as it did Kansas\u2019 on Saturday night. The Wildcats, who made a Final Four-record 18 3-pointers in routing the Jayhawks, missed eight of their first nine long-distance attempts Monday. However, Villanova found something that worked. DiVincenzo shot the Wildcats into the lead with an all-out assault, hitting 3-pointers while also driving for buckets. He scored 10 consecutive points for the Wildcats in a 2:55 span late in the half, enabling Villanova to end the half on a 23-7 run that gave them a 37-28 halftime advantage. The Wildcats\u2019 win follows the Eagles\u2019 Super Bowl triumph, making Philadelphia the first city ever to win the Super Bowl championship and the NCAA championship in the same year, according to TBS.

Taking an inbounds pass in a tie game with three seconds left, Ogunbowale drove into the right corner before firing up a high-arcing 3-pointer from the that was pure to give the Fighting Irish their first national championship since 2001.  Mississippi State was up by five with 2:01 to play, but Notre Dame\u2019s Marina Mabrey hit a 3-pointer and Jackie Young knocked down a jumper to tie the score 58-58 and set up Ogunbowale\u2019s heroics. Jessica Shepard finished with 19 points for Notre Dame (35-3). Ogunbowale had 18, and Mabrey added 10. Victoria Vivians scored 21 points, and Teaira McCowan capped a record-setting women\u2019s NCAA Tournament with 18 points and 17 rebounds for the Bulldogs (37-2). Mississippi State lost in the national championship game for the second straight season. McCowan recorded her 29th double-double of the season. The 6-foot-7 junior finished the tournament with a record 109 rebounds in the Bulldogs\u2019 six-game run to the final. The game featured the last two teams to knock off the Connecticut dynasty. Mississippi State beat UConn in last year\u2019s Final Four but came up short against South Carolina in the championship game. Notre Dame outlasted the Huskies in overtime on Friday, with Ogunbowale hitting the game-winner in the semifinal as well. Notre Dame averaged 92.4 points in its previous five tournament wins but struggled to establish any rhythm against Mississippi State\u2019s pestering man-to-man defense. The Fighting Irish scored only three points in the second quarter and trailed 30-17 at halftime. The three points in the second quarter were the fewest in a period in Final Four history. McCowan had a big hand in Notre Dame\u2019s offensive woes. She had nine points, eight rebounds and two authoritative blocks in the first half. During one stretch midway through the second, she hit a jumper on end and then blocked an attempted layup from Mabrey that led to a turnover. Mississippi State forced 12 first-half turnovers. Notre Dame stormed back in the third quarter. Ogunbowale converted a three-point play with a driving layup and free throw to trim Mississippi State\u2019s lead to 41-38 late in the third quarter. The Irish closed out the quarter with a 16-1 run, tying the score 41-41 on a put-back by Shepard. "

During a recent episode of David Axelrod\u2019s podcast,  The Axe Files,  Phelps opened up about his depression, and blamed the U.S. Olympic Committee for failing to help athletes transition from the grueling demands of training and competition to the letdown that inevitably follows.   The USOC, in my opinion, hasn\u2019t done anything to help us transition after an Olympics,  said Phelps, who estimated that roughly 90 percent of athletes experience post-games depression.  I think it\u2019s sad. I think it\u2019s unfortunate. It\u2019s something that we\u2019re working towards now.  Phelps revealed he had suicidal thoughts after the 2012 London Olympics, where he won several gold medals. He said he was  doing the bare minimum  to compete, and wanted to leave the sport. The feeling came to a head in 2014, he said, when he got his second DUI.   I wanted to die. I straight wanted to die,  he said.  He said he actually checked his supply of sleeping pills  and I had one Ambien left.   And I\u2019m actually happy I only had one,  he added.  That scares the living hell out of me.  The U.S. Olympic Committee didn\u2019t immediately answer a request for comment. USOC offers what it calls the pivot program to help  retiring athletes in their health and well-being as whole people beyond athletics by providing tools, techniques and a support system to discover and cultivate their next passions and goals as they transition out of elite competition.  The goal is to facilitate athletes\u2019 transition into the  real world.  Phelps said he went to rehab in Arizona after his second DUI arrest. He said he hoped the USOC will do more to help other athletes.  Current and former athletes like Olympic swimmer Missy Franklin and NBA star Kevin Love also have publicly discussed their mental health struggles. U.S. senators have called for a probe of the USOC after former USA Gymastics team doctor Larry Nassar\u2019s sexual assault convictions involving young athletes, including Olympians.   We\u2019re competing to represent our country. We\u2019re competing to do everything we can to try to win a medal or to try to do our country proud by wearing the stars and stripes on international ground,  said Phelps.  When we come home from it, you know, they\u2019re like, kind of, \u2018Okay, check. Who\u2019s the next kid coming in? Where\u2019s the next person?\u2019 And I think it\u2019s sad.

            "text": "Amateurism is beaten and bloodied. Still it stands.  Andy Schwarz and Ricky Volante want to deliver the coup de gr\u00e2ce.  Michigan and Villanova are playing tonight for the NCAA\u2019s men\u2019s college basketball championship. A lot of people will make money off this game, and none of them will be anyone who played in it. The NCAA, the television networks, the universities, the coaches and corporate sponsors \u2014 they\u2019ll all get some piece of the millions of dollars raked in annually by the tournament. The actual attraction, the players on the court, won\u2019t receive a dime. Over the last five years, the NCAA  amateurism  model that keeps players from truly sharing in the massive amount of money they create has faced significant challenges. Former UCLA basketball player Ed O\u2019Bannon sued the NCAA in 2009 over the use of college athletes\u2019 names, images and likenesses in video games and won a victory in federal court. Members of Northwestern University\u2019s football squad fought for and won the right to form the first players\u2019 union in college sports history. But each time, the celebrations that accompanied those victories proved premature: A key provision of the O\u2019Bannon ruling that would\u2019ve lifted the NCAA\u2019s ban on compensation was tossed out on appeal; the National Labor Relations Board ruled that Northwestern\u2019s players couldn\u2019t, in fact, form a union.  In 2017, Schwarz, an economist and frequent critic of the NCAA, and Volante, a lawyer, announced the creation of the Historical Basketball League, an alternative to the NCAA that would pay the players on teams at historically black colleges and universities, or HBCUs.  The HBL hasn\u2019t launched yet, but the proposal arrives at an important juncture in the war on the NCAA. Last fall, word came down of an FBI investigation into how major college basketball programs managed to pay their best players, a dubious and destructive exercise in federalizing the NCAA rulebook. The likely immediate outcome will be an entrenchment of the NCAA\u2019s power to police its amateurism ideal, what with the G-Men now working in concert with the governing body\u2019s rent-a-cops.  But other effects likely will be less friendly to the NCAA. For one thing, the possibility of federal criminal charges will surely change the risk calculus for people connected to the bootleg economy of big-time college sports \u2014 the assistant coaches, the sneaker company reps, the bagmen. At some point, you figure, they\u2019re going to start looking for alternatives to the current model. Into this uncertain moment comes the HBL. The proposal is an extension of the argument against the NCAA being heard in the courts and from certain corners of the media. The HBL wants to test the notion, frequently offered by NCAA dead-enders, that people will stop caring about college sports if the athletes are compensated in something other than company scrip. And the league\u2019s focus on black colleges is a reminder that the NCAA\u2019s ruinous attachment to the amateurism ideal creates racist outcomes in which revenue generated by black athletes is redistributed among predominantly white coaches, white administrators, white executives. But Schwarz and Volante want to do more than just mount an argument; they\u2019re trying to build a real basketball league. Last week, HuffPost sat down with them to talk about their proposal, how it would work and who has expressed interest thus far. The following is a transcript of the discussion, edited for length and clarity. HuffPost: What exactly is the HBL? Schwarz: The HBL, it stands for Historical Basketball League, and the  H  is doing double-duty. One is because we\u2019re going to be partnering with historically black colleges and universities. The other thing is, in the formative years of college sports, there were no NCAA rules against pay, and many of those athletes were paid. So we\u2019re returning college basketball to the historic roots of college sports played by college students, but by paid college students. We are a professional college sports league. All of our athletes will be full-time students at HBCUs. Our season is in the summer to make sure it minimizes the conflict between athletics and academics.  The idea here is to essentially put on a great college basketball program, played at great colleges with deep history, with three future NBA or European basketball stars on the court playing each other. The only thing that\u2019s going to be different from what people are used to is that the athletes will be sharing. It\u2019ll be like fair trade basketball \u2015 the workers will be getting a fair share of the revenue that we\u2019re generating. HuffPost: How did the idea come about? Schwarz: So, the two precipitating events were our success \u2015 and I say our because I worked on the case \u2015 in the O\u2019Bannon case, where a judge found that what the NCAA does when it sets a maximum scholarship is price-fixing, and the success of the unionization effort at Northwestern, where a local administrator acknowledged that the duties of a college football player met the definition of an employee under federal labor law. And then the consequent rollback by appeals courts of both of those decisions.  It felt like years of effort to get real change and succeeding and convincing two finders of fact and law were gone in a heartbeat because of older, less-informed people one step up the chain. It was frustrating.  So, if you can\u2019t unionize and you can\u2019t sue them, the other way to beat a cartel is to out-compete them. And the idea here is that by depressing the salary of college athletes, you create an opportunity for entry. Sort of like how by being a horrible taxi company, you create the ability for Lyft or Uber to start grabbing customers. It\u2019s the same thing here, and what we want to do is effectively force the industry to recognize the value of the talent by paying them more. Either they will compete with us, or they won\u2019t.  Volante: Our mission has three different prongs: First and foremost, to create a sports economy that the athletes actually get to participate in. Number two is empowering these schools that historically have considerable significance, especially in the South. And number three is disrupting the concept of amateurism and proving that the concept of amateurism isn\u2019t necessary for college sports to be successful, and furthermore, that amateurism is not necessary for people to tune in and watch, as the NCAA repeatedly claims.  HuffPost: Is this a real plan with a chance to come to fruition, or is it an effort to say,  This is possible for the NCAA to do ? Volante: This is definitely a real plan. We already have several investors from Silicon Valley. We have an investor from the New York tech community. They certainly see the value from a monetization standpoint.  For me, this is a full-time job. We have a team. We have at least 30 people across the country that contribute in some way, shape or form. We have Keith Sparks, who is our chief development officer and was formerly an associate athletic director at Stanford University. And he was able to bring us our CMO, Ralph Greene, who used to head Nike Football and also started Nike Basketball\u2019s international pipeline. This is absolutely a real thing. HuffPost: Why HBCUs? What makes, say, Howard or Grambling the right place to do this? Schwarz: The schools within the NCAA cartel who are getting the short end of the deal are the HBCUs. A Division I HBCU gets less than a million dollars from the NCAA and its conference combined. A [Southeastern Conference] school can get over $40 million. That\u2019s a huge disparity. So what they are getting for the exploitation of black labor is a small amount. And they are, of the people receiving some of these profits, the ones that most recognize that a system in which black labor was more valued would be mission-consistent with their raison d\u2019etre, in a way that some other small schools might think about but not care about. That\u2019s my theory. Volante: Beyond the economic piece of it, historically, these universities have been involved in a number of selfless efforts to offer educational opportunities and further the economic opportunities for African Americans as a whole. A lot of these schools started right after the Civil War during the Reconstruction Era, so there\u2019s the opportunity there that taking these brands which are very strong within the HBCU community and the African-American community and breathing new life into them and showing to the rest of the U.S. how great of institutions they truly are, and how well they prepare individuals for life after college, whether they\u2019re an athlete or not. We think there\u2019s significant upside for the schools to get involved, but also significant upside for these players to go onto campuses where they will be welcomed with open arms and there will be a holistic approach to preparing for life after basketball, or getting all the tools they need to go to the NBA.    HuffPost: Do you worry about the perception of white guys creating a business model that\u2019s, for lack of a better word, experimenting on HBCUs and black athletes? Schwarz: I know people are wary about it because that\u2019s almost always the first question that Ricky and I get when we go in and talk to university presidents. There\u2019s a suspicion of a carpetbagger coming in here and feeding us a line. The good news is, if you go to our website and look at the seven or so people who are really leading the charge here, it\u2019s not a majority white organization at this point. It was my idea, Ricky wrote the original business plan, but we have expanded so that some of that problem has gone away. And when we go to these meetings, generally we\u2019re a mixed group. I think it\u2019s a perfectly valid question to ask:  Why do I care about HBCUs? Isn\u2019t this just me trying to prove a point?  But I hope that anybody who goes to our website thinks about who\u2019s investing in us \u2015 we have an important executive in Silicon Valley who is black and is involved with programs connecting the tech community with HBCUs, we have people who\u2019ve done their Ph.D.\u2019s on the experience of black athletes at predominately white institutions.  HuffPost: Time for the classic question: Where does the money come from to pay these guys, and how much would they make? Volante: We are not asking for a single dime from any school that\u2019s participating in this. The way the plan\u2019s been structured ... it\u2019s club teams on these campuses. That\u2019s done with the sole purpose in mind of protecting the universities. It\u2019s not a fork in the road. It\u2019s not, I turn right and stay with the NCAA, I turn left and go with HBL. This is very much a parallel path that we are going to be operating this club team on the campuses of these HBCUs and the varsity teams will continue to exist. They\u2019ll still get their distributions from the NCAA for March Madness every year. This is complementary revenue, not replacement revenue. The salaries and all the costs of the league are going to be covered initially by private investors. It will shift at a point, hopefully within the first season or two, that our revenues will cover any and all costs and there will be excess left over to not only provide additional payments and grow the salaries of our players, but also ensure that the financial incentive is there for the schools to want to continue to participate. As to determining who gets paid what, much like in professional basketball, it will be driven by talent. Right now, the salaries will range from $50,000 to $100,000 per season. But that\u2019s just a piece of what they get. If you\u2019re Zion Williamson you\u2019re going to get the maximum amount because you\u2019re an elite talent. If you\u2019re a guy who\u2019s a very good basketball player but doesn\u2019t have NBA potential, in that first season he might get $50,000 with the opportunity to grow his salary. The salary is determined year to year.  Schwarz: But to be clear, the scholarship piece is completely unconditional on quality of play. You get a five-year scholarship even if you go to the NBA after one season \u2014 you can come back and use that scholarship.  HuffPost: So you\u2019re guaranteeing a full scholarship plus at least $50,000 a year?  Volante: The thing that gets the headlines is the compensation. Number two is the five-year guaranteed scholarship. Number three is where we start to get into the fringe benefits that any other employee at any place has: having a 401(k) set up, having an appropriate insurance plan, so these guys are going to be protected for injury. We\u2019re going to help them monetize their social media accounts. So a player might walk out of college with a degree \u2015 a real degree \u2015 and also with savings that might be $300,000 to $500,000 or more. HuffPost: Who are you targeting on the recruiting trail? The one-and-dones superstars of the world, or more of the mid-tier college basketball player whose NBA hopes are a little less real? Volante: The shortest answer is both. We want all of them. Schwarz: It\u2019s not just a one-and-done. For that very next tier of folks who are really the bread and butter of what makes March Madness exciting to people \u2015 we want to get that player. And we think, there, [that] the contrast in earnings is the greatest, between what that guy will earn maybe playing in the G-League for a couple years, or playing in Australia or wherever, and losing out on not just the best four years of his earnings but maybe the best six years of his earnings. We think our package is really superior in that spot. HuffPost: What\u2019s been the level of interest from the HBCUs? Volante: We\u2019ve spoken with between 12 and 15, including some of the biggest ones out there. We have a couple of schools that have told us that they would like to be involved, they would like to participate, however they do not want to be the first school to say yes. So finding that first-mover has definitely proven challenging for us.  HuffPost: There are 102 HBCUs across the United States. Are you trying to get all of them to join? Volante: No. There\u2019s a reason why, at least in the U.S., every sports league ends up hovering between 20 and 35 or so teams. Once you go beyond that, the overall cost of a single-entity operation becomes a net-negative as opposed to finding that optimal place. We\u2019re hoping to reach that within five seasons. But the actual profile of the schools we\u2019re trying to get falls into three buckets. Bucket one is an HBCU that you generally know, even the average person, so a Howard or a Hampton. [Number two is] schools that once upon a time, pre-desegregation, were athletic powerhouses, so examples there would be like Florida A&M or Texas Southern. And number three would be smaller institutions that unless you\u2019re in that niche community you probably wouldn\u2019t know, but the school is situated in a major metropolitan area. An example might be Xavier in New Orleans or Fisk in Nashville.  In year one, we want 12 or 16. Once we hit 12, the green light goes, we start recruiting players rapidly, and ramping things up. Schwarz: I think the audience is ready for it. People your age, people Ricky\u2019s age, are ready for it sooner than it feels like legislators would be ready for it. This is a situation where maybe democracy is lagging behind capitalism, in some sense. We don\u2019t need every person in America to tune into our product to be successful. We just need a solid fan base that can cover the cost of a solid league, and we can grow from there. The idea that if some college programs paid their athletes, college sports will die is so silly. And we, among other things, are going to prove that. HuffPost: Has the FBI investigation into college basketball changed your calculus? It seems to me that, say, an Adidas executive or an AAU coach might look around and say,  Why participate in a system that could get me thrown in jail, if there\u2019s another league where all this is legal?  Volante: That\u2019s part of the pitch, at least to certain audiences.  Apparel company conversations have started. Adidas and some of the other bigger ones are going to be forced to change their business model soon if this DOJ investigation really does result in people going to prison. Because otherwise every time you send a representative out, you risk them being arrested. Those companies, sooner rather than later, are going to have to realize that either they continue going down the path they\u2019re on with the NCAA, and don\u2019t change the model and risk people and their lives \u2015 or they align themselves with a model that doesn\u2019t care, that realizes what they\u2019re doing are everyday business practices in every other industry. So Adidas and Nike are primary targets of ours, but they\u2019re certainly not the only ones out there. Schwarz: One of the things we\u2019re offering our athletes is that they can make their own shoe deal.  Volante: What has been the end goal of Adidas\u2019 business model? It\u2019s to eventually have those elite players who have gone to Louisville and other schools, that once they go to the NBA, they\u2019re wearing Adidas shoes. Here you don\u2019t have to have all those intermediate steps. Adidas or Nike can sign those players while they\u2019re in the HBL, and they already have their shoe deal, and those companies can start building their brand around these guys. There\u2019s a lot of potential value here, to Adidas or Nike or whatever company, to the players, and the schools will be getting the benefit the entire time. If the next Zion Williamson is playing for Grambling or Hampton or Howard, that school is going to constantly be in the forefront of peoples\u2019 minds when they\u2019re watching college basketball. You\u2019re not going to think about Duke or Kentucky. You\u2019re going to think about them. HuffPost: So when\u2019s the first game? Volante: There are a ton of chicken-and-egg things going on. Every group of stakeholders is looking at each other and saying,  Are you in? Are you in? Are you in?  However, we are starting to break through those. We\u2019ve been most successful on the investment front, and when you have more money, you\u2019re able to do more things. So I think we\u2019ll be able to ramp up our school recruitment effort significantly in the next couple months. And I would say realistically, the HBL\u2019s inaugural season will tip off on Juneteenth 2020. "

Clark of the Tacoma News Tribune shows the children at Safeco Field kneeling alongside their standing classmates from Seattle\u2019s Mount View Elementary School. Colin Kaepernick retweeted the picture. There was video, too. The apparent protest before the Mariners played the Cleveland Indians follows more than a year of controversy. Athletes have been kneeling during the anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. A spokeswoman for Seattle\u2019s Highline Public Schools called it an  individual act by the students.   Obviously, the school district respects the First Amendment rights of our students,  Catherine Carbone Rogers told HuffPost. Kaepernick began the practice of  taking a knee  during  The Star-Spangled Banner  as a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers. The movement spread to other players and NFL teams \u2015 and even eventually to members of youth teams. President Donald Trump has repeatedly objected to the on-field activism.  On Sunday, the sight of young performers kneeling during the anthem \u2015 and in front of the presentation of flags \u2015 at an MLB game predictably divided Twitter users. While many had praise, others speculated the kids\u2019 parents were behind the demonstration. Some sports outlets applauded the move.  The two young girls who kneeled during their performance at Sunday\u2019s Mariners game are trailblazers, demonstrating that the quest for racial equality and social justice has support from a new generation,  Yahoo Sports wrote. USA Today\u2019s For The Win said:  Kids these days are not going to accept being spectators for important discussions regarding the communities in which they live. The future is in good hands.  "

One cyber security firm said that it has evidence that millions of cards may have been compromised, which would make the breach one of the largest involving payment cards over the past year, but added that it was too soon to confirm whether that was the case. Toronto-based Hudson\u2019s Bay said in a statement that it had  taken steps to contain  the breach but did not say it had succeeded in confirming that its network was secure. It also did not say when the breach had begun or how many payment card numbers were taken.  Once we have more clarity around the facts, we will notify our customers quickly and will offer those impacted free identity protection services, including credit and web monitoring,  the statement said. A company spokeswoman declined to elaborate. The breach comes as Hudson\u2019s Bay struggles to improve its financial performance as a tough retail environment has weighed on sales and margins. Last June, it launched a transformation plan to cut costs and is working to monetize the value of its substantial real estate holdings. Hudson\u2019s Bay disclosed the incident after New York-based cyber security firm Gemini Advisory reported on its blog that Saks and Lord & Taylor had been hacked by a well-known criminal group known as JokerStash. JokerStash, which sells stolen data on the criminal underground, on Wednesday said that it planned to release more than 5 million stolen credit cards, according to Gemini Chief Technology Officer Dmitry Chorine. The hacking group has so far released about 125,000 payment cards, about 75 percent of which appear to have been taken from the Hudson\u2019s Bay units, Chorine told Reuters by telephone. The bulk of the 5 million card numbers that JokerStash said it plans to release are likely from Saks and Lord & Taylor, but it is too early to say for sure, Chorine said.  It\u2019s hard to assess at the moment, primarily because hackers have not released the entire cards in one batch,  he told Reuters. Alex Holden, chief information security officer with cyber security firm Hold Security, confirmed that the 125,000 cards had been released by JokerStash but said it was too soon to estimate how many had been taken from Hudson\u2019s Bay. If in fact millions of records were stolen, the breach would be one of the largest involving payment cards in the past year, but it would still be far smaller than any of the biggest thefts on record, which occurred a decade ago. Hackers stole more than 130 million credit cards from credit-card processor Heartland Payment Systems, convenience store operator 7-Eleven Inc and grocer Hannaford Brothers Co, from 2006 to 2008, according to U.S. federal investigators. Cyber criminals stole some 40 million payment cards in a 2013 hack on Target Corp and 56 million from Home Depot Inc in 2014. Hudson\u2019s Bay said there is no indication its recent breach involved online sales at Saks and Lord& Taylor outlets or its Hudson\u2019s Bay, Home Outfitters and HBC Europe units. The company said that customers will not be liable for fraudulent charges resulting from the breach.

            "text": "You\u2019d think that a man whom several women have accused of sexual harassment or assault \u2015 a man who openly bragged about sexually assaulting women \u2015 would steer clear of any conversation about preventing such behavior. But here we are. President Donald Trump on Friday proclaimed that April was National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, and the irony was lost on no one.  Sexual assault crimes remain tragically common in our society,  the president\u2019s proclamation read.  And offenders too often evade accountability.  At least 19 women have accused Trump of sexual harassment or misconduct. He has yet to be charged and refuses to resign as president, despite lawsuits against him and his own comments about women. In the wake of the powerful Women\u2019s March and amid the momentum of the Me Too movement, any effort to address sexual assault prevention is crucial. But while some of the most powerful men in the country have been knocked from their positions while facing accusations \u2015 including disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein, TV host Matt Lauer and former Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) \u2015 Trump has remained noticeably untouched. Throughout his career as a real estate mogul and reality TV star, Trump has faced several sexual assault lawsuits. Summer Zervos, a former contestant on  The Apprentice,  claims that Trump aggressively kissed her and placed his hand on her breast after she asked him about potential job opportunities in 2007. She filed a defamation lawsuit against Trump after he called her allegations a  hoax.   In 1997, Jill Harth filed a lawsuit claiming that Trump had made unwanted advances toward her, harassed her and repeatedly groped her under a table during dinner. Harth eventually dropped the lawsuit but continues to stand by her story. Many other women have come forward with their accusations against Trump, with incidents ranging from sexually explicit comments to nonconsensual kisses and groping. Trump himself has even admitted to making sexual advances on women without their permission in a shocking audio recording from 2005.   When you\u2019re a star, they let you do it,  Trump told  Access Hollywood  host Billy Bush in the recording.  You can do anything.   Grab them by the pussy,  he added.  You can do anything.  In December, a group of Trump\u2019s accusers held a press conference to urge Congress to investigate their claims. The women shared their accounts of Trump\u2019s actions and explained how it felt to watch a man who had allegedly violated them be elected president after they came forward with their claims.  It was heartbreaking last year when we all \u2014 we\u2019re private citizens \u2014 for us to put ourselves out there to try to show America who this man is and especially how he views women and for them to say, \u2018Meh, we don\u2019t care,\u2019  one of the accusers, Samantha Holvey, said.  It hurt.   After Trump\u2019s National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month proclamation was announced Friday, people turned to their Twitter feeds to point out the obvious. "

            "text": "An international health organization has suspended its partnership with the Heineken beer company because of the controversial use of so-called  beer girls  to promote its products. The Global Fund launched a partnership in January with the Dutch brewer in its latest campaign to battle AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in Africa. Heineken was to use its communications and logistics expertise to help shape effective messages, identify demand and provide quality control in shipments of medical supplies, according to a Heineken statement. But the Global Fund announced on Thursday in a statement that it was suspending its partnership with Heineken  based on recent reports of the company\u2019s use of female beer promoters in ways that expose them to sexual exploitation and health risks,  National Public Radio reported.  We take these allegations very seriously and have challenged Heineken to examine their operations and make changes to protect women from sexual exploitation and health risks,  said Global Fund executive director Peter Sands.  We are suspending the partnership until such time as Heineken can take appropriate action to address these issues.  The mostly young drink promoters are paid low wages \u2014 and work for tips, largely from groups of intoxicated men \u2014 to push certain beers in bars. Heineken has come under particular pressure to end the practice in Southeast Asia, especially Cambodia. A 2011 study found that some Heineken beer girls in Cambodian bars moonlighted as sex workers for extra money and faced increased risks of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. Reporter Olivier van Beemen revealed a similar situation in West African bars in an article in the Dutch publication NRC last week. That was apparently what Sands was referencing when he said  recent reports.  Heineken could not immediately be reached for comment. The company, however, responded to van Beemen\u2019s article, saying it took drink promoters\u2019 risk of sexual exploitation very seriously.   The practices described go completely against what we stand for as a company, and therefore we strongly condemn these malpractices,  said the Heineken statement.  The beer promoters are not employed by Heineken, but are sourced via external agencies ... this makes it difficult to properly supervise the working conditions. However, we simply cannot allow them to continue to be confronted with unwanted intimacies and abuse or even with prostitution during their work.  The company\u2019s statement concluded:  We will take further steps together with our local operating companies, promotional agencies and other relevant parties to deal with these malpractices and prevent them in the future.  Critics had earlier condemned Global Fund\u2019s partnership with Heineken, saying an organization concerned with health should not work with a company pushing alcohol, which can be detrimental to health. It\u2019s been a bad month for Heineken. Earlier this week, the company yanked a beer commercial that Chance the Rapper criticized as  terribly racist.  The Heineken Light ad showed a bartender sliding a bottle along a bar, past several black people, to a fair-skinned woman as the tagline,  Sometimes, lighter is better,  flashed on the screen.  We missed the mark, are taking the feedback to heart and will use this to influence future campaigns,  a Heineken spokesperson told Newsweek. The Global Fund is an international organization headquartered in Geneva that\u2019s the largest funder of programs to battle AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in the world. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation provided seed money for the organization that began in 2002, according to Agence France Presse. "

The 36-year-old accountant and beer-league hockey player filled in as an emergency goalie in his NHL debut, helping the Chicago Blackhawks to a 6-2 victory over the visiting Winnipeg Jets Thursday night. After two goaltenders on the Blackhawks roster went down, Foster was called into action in the third period, according to reports. He stopped all seven shots fired at him in 14 minutes. In the waning moments, the United Center crowd chanted his name. Foster, a former Western Michigan goaltender (2002-06), had attended a dozen or so Blackhawks games as a fail-safe backup. He told reporters afterward (watch above) that he usually sits in the press box and eats dinner. Not this time. In one of sports\u2019 true Walter Mitty moments, the married father of two got to do what most people can only dream of: star for their local major league team. After that, balancing a ledger might not pack the same thrill.  A few hours ago I was sitting on the computer typing on a 10-key,  Foster said afterward.  Now I\u2019m standing in front of you guys having just finished 14 and a half minutes of NHL hockey.  According to the Chicago Tribune, Foster, from nearby Oak Park, will be back in goal Friday \u2015 in the Johnny\u2019s Icehouse Adult League after his shift at Golub Capital. Well, it was glorious while it lasted. "

            "text": "Michigan State University paid a public relations company $517,343 to monitor and track social media activity surrounding the recent Larry Nassar sexual abuse case, the Lansing State Journal reported on Wednesday.  Many of the social media accounts the New York-based firm Weber Shandwick monitored included accounts of survivors, their families and notable celebrities, journalists and politicians. The Lansing State Journal included screenshots of Weber Shandwick\u2019s report to MSU that quoted specific survivors\u2019 tweets, retweets and commentary. The PR firm also outlined news articles that created spikes in conversation surrounding the Nassar case.  MSU\u2019s Office of Communication and Brand Strategy had initially been collecting and tracking the information, but handed the majority of the work over to Weber Shandwick in December.   Michigan State University hired Weber Shandwick in December 2017 to provide crisis communications counsel as well as additional media staffing to handle the high volume of communications tasks related to the Larry Nassar matter,  a spokeswoman for the university told HuffPost.  The relationship ended in early March and we are no long working together.   Although this type of monitoring is not uncommon in criminal cases, the explosive report garnered intense media attention and prompted many Nassar survivors to criticize the surveillance as invasive and triggering.  Weber Shandwick responded to the criticism in a press release provided to HuffPost.  The majority of our work involved crisis counsel to address the tragedy. We were not hired to monitor victims\u2019 social media accounts. As with any assignment, we forwarded to our clients traditional media and publicly available social media pertaining to the horrible tragedy at MSU, including statements made online by the victims,  the statement reads.  The victims were and continue to be the most important voices in the conversation.   Criminal defense attorney Stuart Slotnick, who is not affiliated with the Nassar case, told HuffPost that while MSU\u2019s move may appear to be borderline unethical, it is not unheard of and usually doesn\u2019t violate any laws.  Monitoring social media accounts is not uncommon in the world of litigation. Although it may appear to be unseemly, when monitoring the accounts of victims of the crime, MSU could have been being proactive in addressing complaints by hearing them directly the source,  he said.  There are no legal implications to monitoring social media accounts, so long as they are public accounts and not private.   Still, many survivors feel the university unjustly invaded their privacy. Finding out that MSU was surveilling them the entire time they were screaming for justice has made many survivors feel they\u2019re being targeted yet again \u2015 and by the very institution that so horribly failed them in the first place.   I was absolutely disgusted to learn that MSU was using such an invasive tactic,  former gymnast and Nassar survivor Larissa Boyce told HuffPost in an email.  I felt violated all over again.   Boyce, who says that Nassar began abusing her when she was 16 years old in 1997 and continued until 2001, told then-MSU gymnastics coach Kathie Klages of the abuse the year it started. Klages, who has since retired, told Boyce she must have misunderstood the medical procedure and sent the teenager back to Nassar. After everything Boyce has endured at the hands of MSU, she said she\u2019s not surprised by the university\u2019s most recent move.   Sadly, I\u2019m not surprised, as this is yet another example of how [MSU is] more concerned about protecting their brand than survivors,  she said.  They\u2019ve been saying that they are on our side but this proves once again they are re-victimizing us and trying to find ways to attack our character. Time to start looking at their own house! That money should have been used to check all of their employees computers & social media!  Rachael Denhollander, the first woman to publicly accuse Nassar of sexual abuse, reacted on Twitter to the surveillance news Wednesday.  If MSU wanted to know about me and other survivors, they could have just talked to us. We had outstanding offers [to] meet with them,  she wrote.  Nassar served as the team doctor for USA Gymnastics and for several different sports teams on MSU\u2019s campus. Over the course of two decades, he sexually abused over 260 young girls and women under the guise of medical treatment. He recently received three concurrent sentences of 60 years, 40-125 years and 40-175 years in prison for child sexual abuse and child pornography.  Although Nassar will spend the rest of his life in prison, many survivors have called for heads to roll at USA Gymnastics, the U.S. Olympic Committee and specifically MSU, claiming those institutions enabled Nassar\u2019s abuse. Several of Nassar\u2019s victims (including Boyce) say they reported the abuse to MSU coaches and trainers over the course of two decades, but their accusations were continually disregarded or swept under the rug. At least 14 MSU representatives knew about Nassar\u2019s abuse and failed to report it. Both the Michigan attorneys general\u2019s office and the U.S. Education Department have launched investigations into how the university handled the Nassar abuse allegations.  Attorney John Manly, who represents more than 100 Nassar victims, tweeted his disappointment as well:  Michigan State paid $500,000.00 in January to spy on Nassar survivors and their families on social media. The MSU Board was copied on these reports. Not one Board member had the moral courage to say this is wrong. Stop it. Not one. Shame on MSU. Shame on each and every Trustee.  Morgan McCaul, a Nassar survivor and current first-year student at MSU, explained to HuffPost how invasive it felt when she found out the university had been tracking her social media all along.   While MSU tracked our social media cries for accountability and justice, they ignored and enabled yet another predator \u2015 and they did it at an incomprehensible cost,  McCaul said, referring to Nassar\u2019s longtime boss, William Strampel, who was recently arrested on multiple sexual misconduct charges for allegedly sexual harassing and assaulting female MSU students.  McCaul told The State News, MSU\u2019s student newspaper, that she believes this is possibly the worst thing the univeristy has done.  "

Under Armour Inc., which owns the nutritional app, announced Thursday that an  unauthorized party  gained access to the data in late February. Information acquired by the hackers included user names, email addresses and hashed passwords, the company said. Social Security numbers and driver\u2019s license numbers were not affected since the app doesn\u2019t collect that information. Payment card information was also unaffected because the company collects and processes that information separately.  The company says it does not know the identity of the party responsible for the security breach. MyFitnessPal allows users to track their daily meals, count how many calories they consume and search for the nutritional information of specific foods. In a notice to the app\u2019s users, Under Armour Chief Digital Officer Paul Fipps said the company learned of the breach on Sunday. The company alerted its users four days later.  We are working with leading data security firms to assist in our investigation,  Fipps wrote.  We have also notified and are coordinating with law enforcement authorities.  The company is urging MyFitnessPal users to change their passwords immediately.  Under Armour is the latest victim of a string of security breaches affecting companies in all industries. Orbitz, a travel booking site, announced this month that it had a security breach that affected about 880,000 payment cards from the site\u2019s users. Equifax also announced this month that it had another massive data breach affecting 2.4 million customers in 2017, six months after it revealed a previous breach that affected 143 million additional people. Other major organizations to face widespread security breaches in recent years include Yahoo, Uber and the Pentagon. "

            "text": "A judicial oversight committee says an embattled New Jersey judge violated rules of conduct when he asked an alleged rape victim during a May 2016 hearing whether she knew to close her legs to prevent sexual assault. The state Supreme Court\u2019s Advisory Committee on Judicial Conduct detailed the incident along with three other alleged code violations in a complaint against Superior Court Judge John F. Russo filed on Monday. The woman had been seeking a restraining order against the man who allegedly raped her.  During the hearing, the plaintiff said she and the defendant had just returned from a trip to Home Depot when he raped her. The two share a daughter. Later, Russo took over a line of questioning from a defense attorney aimed at illustrating that the plaintiff could have done more to prevent the assault. When Russo asked whether she knew  how to stop somebody from having intercourse  with her, the plaintiff gave several responses, saying she would either physically harm the assailant, tell them no or run away.  Close your legs? Call the police? Did you do any of those things?  Russo continued, according to the court transcript.  The complaint stated that the judge  mistreated the victim  with his  irrelevant  and  discourteous  questions. In another instance detailed in the complaint, Russo allegedly violated rules of conduct when he ruled on an alimony case in which he admitted to knowing both parties. The judge reduced the amount of back alimony owed by the man involved in the case from $10,000 to just $300.  Judge Russo looks forward to a public hearing in which he will be able to respond to the allegations against him,  attorney David Corrigan said in a statement provided to KPVI, a local NBC affiliate.  We have respect for the process as well as the advisory committee on judicial conduct, and therefore won\u2019t comment further.  Russo was placed on paid administrative leave from New Jersey\u2019s Ocean County Courthouse in May. According to the Asbury Park Press, the decision came after he allegedly threw a file at a female law clerk, although there are other previous complaints about his behavior. Superior Court Assignment Judge Marlene Lynch Ford has told Russo he can not return to work until he submits to and passes a psychiatric evaluation, the Park Press reported. "

            "text": "Stock photography is synonymous with outdated and ridiculous gender stereotypes. There\u2019s women laughing alone with salad \u2015 a viral meme that has morphed into women laughing alone with tablets \u2015 and the many shots of alpha men sitting at the head of boardroom tables or barbecuing steaks. The models in all these examples are usually white and extremely heteronormative. But stock photo companies are increasingly trying to reflect our current culture. In the past few years, Getty, Adobe and Shutterstock have all tried to break away from the clich\u00e9s they\u2019re known for reinforcing, especially as a new crop of stock photo startups focus exclusively on diverse images. Giants like Getty started with tackling female stereotypes, teaming up with Sheryl Sandberg in 2014 to create the  Lean In  collection, which shows women working in labs and hiking, no romaine lettuce in sight. Now the company is turning its lens on men by focusing on the theme of  Masculinity Undone.  Getty recently released a compilation of images that feature men parenting, hugging one another and looking pensive as they stare out windows. Launched in January, the photos include men of color, men with long hair, and men who are shirtless despite lacking well-defined pecs and biceps.  We\u2019re trying to focus on imagery that represents a more complex version of manhood and a more gentle side,  Guy Merrill, Getty\u2019s global head of art, told HuffPost.  We\u2019re breaking away from stereotypes: the business leader, the absent father and buffoon \u2026 the lonely guy who doesn\u2019t need any friends or community.  Shutterstock has created a  Modern Man  collection full of male nurses, gay couples and guys who love to garden, while Adobe is showcasing  The Fluid Self,  which includes photos of men wearing makeup, earrings and dressed in drag, as well as portraits of the transgender community. The shift comes amid an ongoing cultural conversation about what it means to  be a man.  There\u2019s been a backlash against the type of aggressive, authoritative manliness embodied by President Donald Trump and white nationalists, along with a growing awareness that men struggle with mental illness and high suicide rates. Today\u2019s hip young male celebrities are less macho in appearance and demeanor \u2015 think Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Harry Styles. Jay-Z talks openly about being in therapy, Jaden Smith wears dresses, and in every episode of  Queer Eye,  the Netflix makeover series, a man breaks down in tears. Advertisers have taken note: Last year Axe body spray launched a campaign called  Is It OK For Guys?  that tackles the vulnerabilities men are taught to suppress (Is it OK to be skinny? Is it OK to be depressed?). And Lululemon released videos of men talking about emotional strength. Stock photo companies say data, client feedback and cultural trends have pushed them to focus on changing definitions of masculinity and gender fluidity. In the past few years, Getty searches for  man meditation  went up by 126 percent,  man looking worried  by 100 percent and  gay dads  by 53 percent, according to the company. A recent Shutterstock survey found that 41 percent of U.S. marketers think it\u2019s important to use images that reflect  modern day society.   Younger people are getting into college and moving into the workforce and they have much more modern ideas about masculinity and femininity,  said Robyn Lange, Shutterstock\u2019s curator.  There\u2019s no longer buckets you place these [genders] into. It\u2019s more of a spectrum.  In theory, stock photography is well-poised to help people think more progressively about gender. These images are ubiquitous, appearing on billboards and storefronts and in online articles and videos, where they are constantly tempting us to take out loans, travel to Hawaii and whiten our teeth.   People aren\u2019t aware of how much stock they\u2019re seeing every day, everywhere, on every platform,  said Brenda Mills, Adobe\u2019s principal of creative services and visual trends.  And so it has a huge influence over people\u2019s lives.  Raising the visibility of men with regular bodies being emotionally vulnerable or working in traditionally  female  jobs would allow them to become normal aspects of masculinity, rather than effeminate anomalies.   Part of what we need are images to help us create a new reality,  said Tristan Bridges, an assistant sociology professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.  What would it look like if men and women didn\u2019t have to wear different types of clothes or we didn\u2019t have to imagine them in different types of jobs?  But Giorgia Aiello, an associate media and communication professor at the University of Leeds in England who studies stock photos, sees these diversity collections as  branding exercises  \u2015 a way to appear  cutting edge  rather than to truly change gender norms.   Although Getty images in particular tries to really confer a political kind of tone to what they are doing with stock photography, in the end the bottom line is purely commercial,  she said.  In some ways it is good they are doing it, but it\u2019s certainly not going to really deeply affect their business model.   Stock photo businesses have little control over what their photographers shoot and how clients use those images. Getty and Shutterstock both have more than 200,000 contributors, ranging from iPhone amateurs to professionals, who all earn royalties every time their work is licensed. While companies send out reports detailing the type of shots they want \u2015 more men sitting in half lotus, please \u2015 once contributors have been accepted onto the platform, they can upload whatever images they choose, so long as they aren\u2019t offensive or illegal. Getty\u2019s  Lean In  collection, for example, represents just 0.01 percent of the company\u2019s more than 190 million images.  If someone wants to shoot pictures of women eating salad, despite all the memes, we can\u2019t stop them,  said Merrill, though he noted that Getty art directors are working directly with some of their professional contributors on  Masculinity Undone -themed shoots.   Stock photo companies also have no control over how clients use the photos. In 2007, Getty\u2019s top-selling image for the search term  woman  was a half-naked woman lying on a bed. Now it\u2019s a woman hiking a rocky trail. But Aiello said that doesn\u2019t necessarily equal progress. She has found that photos from the  Lean In  collection most often appeared in  lightweight  lifestyle articles or articles on gender discrimination.   Quite a few of these images showing women as scientists were not used in general science journalism,  she said,  but in articles that talked about how difficult it was for women to have a career in science.   While it\u2019s possible that images of diverse masculinity will be confined to pieces about fashion or the evolution of manhood rather than used to illustrate more general topics, Adobe\u2019s Mills doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s a problem. Her  fashion and grooming  clients currently have the biggest appetite for non-stereotypical images of men, she said, because those photos help them reach a new market. But more companies have begun to show interest.   I\u2019m surprised by some of the clients, who I thought might be more conservative, being incredibly open to this \u2018Fluid Self\u2019 trend,  Mills said.  They\u2019re actually incredibly hungry for it.  Getty\u2019s Merrill said that even if his customers aren\u2019t begging for more nuanced photos of men, his team has a responsibility to push them in a more progressive direction.   It\u2019s not simply our jobs to create the images our customers want \u2015 we also want to re-picture clich\u00e9s for them,  he said.  This is where we need to be in a year or two. Our customers might not be there yet, but we know they are going to be. And we want to make sure they have the pictures and the imagery when that happens.   "

            "text": "A sixth woman has come forward to complain about sexual discrimination at Monster Energy, a male-dominated beverage company that appears to be plagued by a toxic work culture.  The woman, Karen Simmons, a 50-year-old former sales representative based in Alabama, spent nearly two years with Monster. She amassed a strong track record, even as she fended off one of her Atlanta-based managers, Ted Cook, who hit on her, made comments about her breasts, tried to get her drunk and invited her more than once for an  evening nightcap  in his hotel room on work trips, she told HuffPost.  Robert Duck, Simmons\u2019 direct boss who works out of Monster\u2019s office in Florida, also witnessed Cook\u2019s behavior, but told her to brush it off, she said.  He said Ted was harmless, \u2018a dirty old man,\u2019  Simmons recalled.  Through a company spokesman, Duck said Simmons never complained. When reached by phone by HuffPost, he hung up. He did not respond to follow-up texts. Cook also did not respond to a call, text or LinkedIn message.  Simmons took her complaints no further.  What was I gonna say? I loved my job. I needed my job,  she said.  Simmons had worked for about 20 years in the beverage industry, a notoriously unfriendly business for women.  I knew saying things gets you retaliation.  What Simmons did not realize was that whether or not she spoke up, she was already trapped inside a company where the odds are stacked against women.   Last April, Simmons was fired for reasons she still doesn\u2019t quite understand. Monster says it was for poor performance, according to a spokesman for the company. Simmons says her dismissal occurred a few months after receiving a generally positive performance review and just as she was poised to win an internal sales contest. In the fall, she filed sex and age discrimination charges against Monster at the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Monster is also facing lawsuits from five other women over complaints of sexual discrimination and other issues, as first reported in a HuffPost investigation in January. One Monster executive, head of music marketing Brent Hamilton, is facing felony assault charges for allegedly strangling his girlfriend on a company business trip. He is still employed by the company. Another executive, John Kenneally, a vice president accused of sexually harassing two women at the company, resigned after HuffPost published details of the accusations in January. He ran the business unit that Simmons worked in. In public statements at the time, the company painted the women as disgruntled employees and said that the suits were unrelated.   Monster Energy has zero-tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind,  the company said in January.  Monster takes all reported complaints very seriously. Any suggestions to the contrary are false.  Just as HuffPost was set to publish this story, Monster announced it was hiring a third party to review its human resource policies and procedures. The investigators will report straight to the company\u2019s board of directors.  We are confident that the recent portrayal of the company in the media is not representative of [our] culture and practices,  Monster chairman and CEO Rodney Sacks and vice chair and president Hilton Schlosberg said in a statement. But they added that  in the context of the allegations made by the women bringing these lawsuits, we believe it is prudent.  The company declined to provide more details on the third party.  If there are areas where there are deficients, we will correct them,  Sacks and Schlosberg said. In a statement to HuffPost earlier in March, Monster said it wasn\u2019t aware of Simmons\u2019 complaints until recently.    Ms. Simmons did not make any allegation of harassment to the company or to her manager while she was employed by the company,  the statement said. Monster only learned of the claim at a mediation session with Simmons and her lawyer in mid-February, the statement said. This was about three weeks after HuffPost published its investigation, the statement points out. Monster also said that Cook is no longer with the company. Simmons\u2019 former boss Duck, who she said witnessed Cook\u2019s behavior, is still working at Monster.   Through a spokesman, Monster also told HuffPost that Simmons\u2019 account was  not accurate.  Simmons\u2019 last employee evaluation included significant feedback about areas for improvement, the spokesman said. It was not positive. In response to other questions and requests for information, the spokesman wrote:  Many of the other allegations or questions are untrue, are missing facts or are irrelevant but we are not going to engage in a back and forth about this.   After reading HuffPost\u2019s reports, and looking into the cases filed against Monster, Simmons was shocked to learn that another female employee at the company, Page Zeringue, had gone to the human resources department to complain about Cook \u2015 well before Simmons started working under him.  In a lawsuit against Monster, Zeringue alleges that her complaint to HR helped trigger her firing, ostensibly for bad performance. Meanwhile, Cook was sent to sexual harassment training, according to internal documents viewed by HuffPost. This was around the same time Simmons was hired.   Monster Energy markets its drinks primarily to men using cliched tropes about masculinity. Scantily clad Monster Girls in leather bikini tops serve as brand ambassadors. One beverage is actually called  Assault.  A few years ago, the company gave out Monster branded condoms as a promotional gimmick. That toxic male culture translates into policy where sexual harassment is not taken seriously. Monster\u2019s employee guidelines \u2015 reviewed by HuffPost  \u2015 require that managers who observe sexual misconduct must report it. But in Simmons\u2019 case, it appears that her direct boss, Duck, never informed HR about Cook\u2019s conduct.   Even if HR learns about misbehavior, what passes for an investigation into sexual harassment complaints seems to amount to a surface questioning of the parties involved, where the accounts of men are weighed more seriously.   At Monster, terminations may be helped along by a confusing performance review process where managers are allowed to add damaging comments into evaluations, months after employees read their reviews, according to documents reviewed by HuffPost.  Even in an industry known for being heavily male, Monster stands out \u2015 particularly in the sales division where Simmons worked.    Overall, only 13 percent of the company\u2019s 505-person U.S. sales team are women. If you include administrative assistants, the percentage rises to 18 percent female, according to an internal employee directory from January obtained by HuffPost. None of the company\u2019s 11 vice-presidents in sales are women.  Monster said some of the numbers HuffPost obtained were incorrect, but declined to offer specifics or provide its own data. In an earlier statement to HuffPost the company said  many women hold top leadership positions within Monster,  and pointed to its chief commercialization officer, Emelie Tirre. Still, sales is so male-dominated at Monster that at a 2016 national sales meeting in Las Vegas \u2015 even with human resource representatives in attendance \u2015 a vice-president told a blatantly misogynistic joke to a packed room, according to three separate accounts from current and former employees.  The joke goes like this: There is an old bull and a young bull on a hill, overlooking a field of cows. Young bull says to the old bull:  Let\u2019s run down there and fuck a cow.  Old bull says, nah:  Let\u2019s walk down there and fuck them all.  It was meant to inspire. Simmons recalls being appalled. But she was used to hearing sexist talk from male colleagues. After all, she had spent most of her career in beverage sales, a notoriously sexist culture. She knew how to handle herself.  Over the past three years, at least four other women in the east division, where Simmons worked, were fired or pushed out. They include Simmons, two other women who are suing the company for sex discrimination, and one who declined to speak on the record with HuffPost but has since quit. As of January 2018, there were only 16 women out of 153 employees working in the east division. Simmons was often the only woman at the dinners and events where she would meet up with Cook and Duck. Given the company\u2019s cultural penchant for partying, drinking alcohol at these meet-ups was a given.  She didn\u2019t drink, and repeatedly rebuffed Cook\u2019s efforts to  get her drunk,  she said. She declined his invitations for a  nightcap  in his hotel room.   The more Ted drank, the more handsy he got,  Simmons told HuffPost. On one occasion when he asked for a hug, Simmons said she uncomfortably gave him a half-hug. He wasn\u2019t satisfied, and pulled her in for a do-over, she said.  He said, \u2019I felt that,  Simmons said, meaning he could feel the pressure of her breasts on his chest.   Arguably, Simmons should never have had to deal with Cook in the first place. Two years earlier Zeringue had filed her complaint about him with the human resources department, according to the lawsuit she filed last year against the company. Huffpost obtained Zeringue\u2019s original complaint to HR. In it she said Cook had a reputation for getting grabby when he drinks, and was known as  Touchy Ted  around the office. She detailed an incident where he talked to her about her breasts and those of a coworker; he also pulled the hugging-close move on her, she said. The HR department reached out to Cook\u2019s boss, Kenneally, the executive who recently resigned in the face of harassment allegations after HuffPost\u2019s investigation published. Kenneally defended Cook, telling the HR representative he had already spoken with him about the incident and there were  no noted recurrences,  according to a review of an internal HR report obtained by HuffPost. Kenneally also made a point of criticizing Zeringue. Her  performance is not where it needs to be,  he is quoted as saying.  When Cook was confronted by HR, he confessed and said  he learned his lesson,  according to internal notes. He also conceded that  touchy Ted  was one of the nicknames he was known by inside the company, another being  Uncle Ted.  He was assigned to sexual harassment training, called  stop sexual harassment training for supervisors,  and given a warning. It\u2019s unclear if HR ever planned any kind of followup to make sure he stayed on track. Zeringue was fired a month later. In her complaint against Monster she claims her firing amounted to retaliation for speaking up. That suit is now headed to private arbitration \u2015 outside the public court system. It was around this time, at a dinner in New Orleans that Simmons attended with Cook, Duck and several other male Monster employees that she said she heard them joking about  having to go to HR classes,  if they misbehaved.  It was just like a big joke,  Simmons said Simmons\u2019 last few months at Monster played out like a corporate gaslighting.  In February 2017, less than two months after she had received a decent performance review from Duck, he asked to meet up with her in Florida where they had both traveled for business.  What happened next came as a total shock. Duck showed her a disciplinary write-up.   For stuff I didn\u2019t do,  Simmons said. The writeup \u2015 which HuffPost has reviewed \u2015  claimed she was unwilling to leave her hometown for work. Yet, she was in Florida on a business trip at the time she was given the writeup.  I was out of town every week,  she said. The writeup also claims that Duck spoke with Simmons in January about these issues. Simmons said the only feedback she got that month came when she downloaded her performance review from the company\u2019s internal website. Monster provided HuffPost with a copy of the document. Dated Dec. 31, the review judges Simmons\u2019 performance as  Meets Standards,  giving her a 2.14 rating out of 4, and was generally upbeat and positive but is peppered with constructive criticism.   At this point the only thing I can ask Karen to improve on is slowing down,  Duck wrote.  She also needs a little more work on time management.   He called her a  great problem solver,  who sometimes needs help prioritizing,  I have asked her to make sure when she schedules a meeting...to ALWAYS make sure she can do it\u2026  In the category of  job knowledge and skill,  Duck gave Simmons a rating of 3 or  exceeds expectations.  So the negative writeup baffled Simmons.  She cried.   Where is this coming from?  she asked him. She wanted to understand what she did wrong, so she could fix things. He refused to provide more details.  He said I was making things worse and to go home and forget about it,  Simmons said. For about a month-and-a-half after that, Duck, still Simmons\u2019 direct supervisor, did not talk to Simmons. She said he wouldn\u2019t respond to texts or calls. One thing he apparently did do: update Simmons\u2019 Dec. 31 performance review \u2015 topping the document off with an extremely harsh  summary paragraph  slamming her for poor performance.  The added paragraph is dated March 3, 2017. The tone of this text is vastly different from the rest of the document.  At this point, Karen has lost the trust of some of her bottlers and needs to \u2018fix\u2019 this soon or she will struggle,  Duck wrote.  Karen acts disconnected in meetings and face to face with her Coke partners.  Duck used gender-coded words like  abrasive  and  demanding  to describe her demeanor with outside contacts at Coca-Cola bottlers Simmons worked with. The final comment was meant to assess Simmons\u2019 work from the end of December through March, a Monster spokesman told HuffPost.  The final comments reflect not only her manager\u2019s assessment of her work through 12/31/17,  he said.  But the final comment on 03/03/17 was also influenced by her performance in the months after 12/31/17 and before the final comment.  Simmons said she had not seen this paragraph until she was asked about it by HuffPost.  Monster, which provided HuffPost with the review, claimed that Simmons had likely seen the additional paragraph. However, Monster could not provide evidence that she did. According to Monster\u2019s records, Simmons signed her review on March 1 \u2015 two days before Duck signed off on the harsh additional paragraph.  Finally, in late April, Duck broke the silence. He called Simmons and said he needed to meet in person. But when he met her in a hotel lobby in her hometown of Daphne, Alabama, he was there with Cook and they had an HR representative on the phone to talk to her.  She was fired.  It was like somebody just punched me in the stomach,  Simmons said. She cried and begged, she said, telling them she needed the insurance and that her family would suffer. She was offered two weeks severance \u2015 if she signed a document promising not to sue.  I didn\u2019t sign. I just think it was wrong. It was totally wrong,  she said.  Two weeks pay for what they did is wrong.  Zeringue  \u2015 the woman who had complained about Cook years earlier \u2015 also was offered two weeks severance when she was fired. She declined, too. Interestingly, Cook retired less than a month later. It\u2019s unclear why. His colleagues threw him a going away party.  And just a few months later, during Christmas time in 2017, Cook returned to Monster\u2019s Atlanta office dressed up as Santa Claus. Young women at the office sat in his lap and posed for pictures. One woman posted a shot on Facebook captioned #UncleTed.  Simmons, meanwhile, took her dismissal hard. She was so embarrassed about being fired that she stopped leaving her home during the day, not wanting anyone in her small Alabama hometown to ask her why she wasn\u2019t working.  The first six months were awful,  she said.  If I needed to go out, I\u2019d go at three or four in the morning or ten or 11 at night.  Because she lost her job, Simmons\u2019 husband, a 68-year-old who supervises utility crews in Tampa, has had to put off his retirement. He had relocated to Tampa temporarily to make a little extra cash before finishing his career. Now it\u2019s unclear when he can come home.    This has affected my marriage, my life. It\u2019s been really tough on my family,  she said, breaking down in tears. Simmons is responsible for paying college tuition for her 21-year-old daughter.  My daughter worries all the time. I told her don\u2019t worry about it; we\u2019ll figure a way around it.  Do you have a story to tell about sexual harassment or discrimination at Monster or another workplace?

            "text": "In the face of the chaos and confusion that come with raising a family today, parents across America turn to a very specific place for sanctuary and relief. While it may not be fancy or private, it\u2019s got an air of sophistication and serenity. What is this magical place? Well... Target, apparently. It\u2019s no secret that parents, particularly moms, love to love Target. They write rhapsodizing blog posts, create fan Instagram accounts, draw comics and tweet endlessly about their Target obsessions. At least one mom chose to take her maternity photos at a Target store, and another even gave birth to her child in one (albeit unintentionally). But what exactly is it that makes Target so appealing to moms and dads? We spoke to marketing experts, therapists and parents themselves to find out.  I never thought dashing to Target without kids would feel like a mini-vacation, but it does. And sometimes that\u2019s all a mom of little kids needs to recharge,  mom and blogger Jennifer S. White told HuffPost. Indeed, many parents find that Target offers them an opportunity to escape the chaos and stress at home without feeling guilty \u2026 because, after all, they\u2019re running errands and buying necessities (and some non-necessities, too) for their families.   Target is close by and a more socially acceptable place for parents to sneak away to solo than, say, a bar,  said mom and blogger Samantha Taylor, who also told HuffPost she sees solo Target trips as  mini-vacations.  Jennifer Cutler, an assistant professor of marketing at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management, believes Target offers a sense of  whimsical escapism  that particularly appeals to parents.  Part of its brand is trying to make the shopping experience a treat. One thing that parents have in common is a shortage of time. Being able to reframe the drudgery of running errands as whimsical escapism is really powerful,  she told HuffPost, pointing out the colorful \u2015 and even magical \u2015 imagery in the brand\u2019s marketing materials.  It\u2019s saying, \u2019Come to this magical place where you can get whatever your heart desires; a clean, friendly place with Starbucks coffee and popcorn waiting for you,\u2019  Cutler added.  I think that really resonates because it joins a productive activity with something whimsical and almost vacation-like in the experience.  The convenience and affordability of a big-box store are undeniable as well.  Target is so addictive because it has everything you need: from batteries, to groceries, to cat litter. And it has a bunch of stuff you don\u2019t need but really want when you see it, like super-cute earrings for you and cheap, adorable outfit separates for your kids,  Taylor explained.  We feel guilty about going on a frivolous shopping binge but not about throwing a $5 pair of clearance earrings in with the cleaning supplies inside our cart.  Still, it goes beyond the convenience and low prices, which many major stores offer. The physical experience of being in a Target store is another reason parents give for their fandom.   Walking into a Target is a mild high in itself,  said Taylor.  That food court and smell of popcorn. That cute little dog. That comfortingly simple logo. That Dollar Spot where everything is actually $3, but that\u2019s OK.  The blogger also also cited the presence of Starbucks in many Targets:  HELLO strolling the racks under the guise of shopping for necessities with a steaming Caramel Macchiato.  The neat appearance of the stores can also feel refreshing for parents, as households with young kids are not necessarily so clean and organized, said Mabel Yiu, a licensed marriage and family therapist and mother of twins.   You walk into Target, and the lighting, the colors, even the smell really capture you because it feels great,  said Yiu.  It\u2019s like it increases the dopamine in the brain. You see that everything is really well-organized and even color-coded. As a mom, my home doesn\u2019t look like that. So you walk in and think, \u2018This is really great.\u2019   Dad and blogger Beau Coffron echoed this sentiment.  They do a great job of keeping the aisles organized, so you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re in the middle of a tornado with stuff everywhere, like some stores are,  he told HuffPost. The look and feel of Target stores appeal to consumers\u2019 different senses \u2015 from the sound of upbeat music to the scent of coffee and popcorn. Rima Tour\u00e9-Tillery, an assistant professor at the Kellogg School who studies the intersection of motivation and self-perception in marketing, said the inviting appearance of Target relates to the brand\u2019s colors: red and white.   Research shows that people see red as a fun, fiery, daring color and  the color of love.  Meanwhile, white gives a sense of cleanliness, spaciousness and elegance.   These associations are not things people consciously think about, but they influence you,  said Tour\u00e9-Tillery.  So just being exposed to the red and white in the store can give you an impression of sophistication.  Maybe that explains why people say  Tar-jay  to make the store sound fancier. Collaborations with high-end brands like Proenza Schouler, Missoni and Jason Wu also add to this classier image. Store layouts and color schemes are typically very conscious choices meant to appeal to consumers.   Brands aren\u2019t stupid. They\u2019re studying this, and the retail environment they\u2019re trying to create is to maximize the experience, the memories, the emotion,  said the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania marketing professor Americus Reed, noting that there are design principles meant to pique shoppers\u2019 curiosity and guide them through the store. Store designs can also appeal to children shopping with their parents.  Aisles are designed a certain way. Things that are going to be important for kids are lower to the ground. That\u2019s for a reason,  Reed told HuffPost.  In the case of Target, parents can use the presence of toys and other fun things for kids to their advantage \u2015 by using them as potential rewards for good behavior in the store.   I prefer to shop Target alone as a sort of pathetic mini-vacation, but if I bring my kids, I like to keep them strapped in to the baby seat whenever possible,  Taylor told HuffPost.  Usually I\u2019ll reward them with a trip to the toy aisle, just to look, if they behave.  Creating a memorable, appealing shopping experience is crucial in the age of online retail giants. Indeed, recent reports have shown disappointing profits for Target as it competes with Amazon.   Behemoths like Amazon are commoditizing convenience. People don\u2019t want to go out and be physically in stores as much anymore because you can just hop online and get a box in a few hours,  Reed said.  You have to create other experiences in a shopping context that are going to make it worthwhile to go out and do that instead of going to Amazon.com. So maybe that\u2019s creating some more motivational impetus for these brands like Target to craft a richer experience for parents and children going in the store.  One way to combat the growing influence of Amazon happens to be another reason experts cited when exploring why parents are so obsessed with Target: identity loyalty.    The concept is that there are some brands for which the brand itself transcends the functional features, the utilitarian benefits in terms of what it does, and it becomes something that is part of who you are,  Reed explained.  When the brand becomes part and parcel with some important aspect of your desired self-expression, then the brand\u2019s identity and your own identity become fused. It\u2019s like the brand is part of who you are, and you have loyalty to it because it\u2019s a symbol of what you aspire to express to other people.  Kellogg marketing professor Angela Lee echoed that.  Many young moms identify with Target, with the image of \u2018fun and fashionable\u2019 that the store projects. That\u2019s what it means when one is a committed loyalist \u2015 the brand becomes part of the self.  When brands achieve identity loyalty, they essentially have a free marketing department. Loyal followers proselytize and also defend the brand against criticism, because an attack on the brand feels in some way like an attack on the self.  In some ways, one\u2019s identity as a parent can become wrapped up in a store like Target.  At the end of a shopping trip, you have shopped for many aspects of your life \u2015 you got birthday gifts for a kid\u2019s party, gifts for your in-laws, yoga pants for exercising, work clothes, etc. You walk out feeling very accomplished and competent,  Yiu explained.  And your self-image matches the idealized self you see in Target ads showing happy, competent parents.  White told HuffPost she\u2019s noticed many kids love Target almost as much as their parents do.   Once I took my kids out for ice cream. It was a surprise, and I expected them to be thrilled,  White recalled.  They weren\u2019t. They looked out the window, across the street to Target and said they wanted to go there for their \u2018surprise\u2019 instead.  In this way, the store creates opportunities for parenting wins, ways to live up to an idealized image of a perfect parent.  The connection between Target and identity might also involve the company\u2019s values and stances on specific issues \u2015 like its support for breastfeeding mothers and transgender people. White told HuffPost she supports the company\u2019s attention to many issues that matter to parents.  Target has done an incredible job attempting to stay on top of current parental concerns, like clothing and gender, and making the store accessible for families with special needs.   They\u2019re family conscious and socially conscious, so it\u2019s a cool brand to be behind and something to be proud of,  said Kathy Morelli, a New Jersey-based mental health counselor. Target as a company is clearly quite aware of its cult-like status among moms.  Target is much more than a place that just sells stuff. We\u2019re a meaningful part of the community and our guests\u2019 lives. From our registry benefits to baby must-haves to the many ways moms can shop and get their orders quickly and all at affordable prices, we often hear that Target is her \u2018happy place,\u2019 and that\u2019s a badge of honor we never take for granted,  Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer Rick Gomez told HuffPost. The company has even played into its friendly image with family-focused initiatives, like their  First Target Run  onesies.  [W]e see a number of moms share on social that their first outing with their new baby is often to Target \u2015 it\u2019s where they feel safe, comfortable, and know they can check off a few errands and maybe sneak in a treat or two for themselves,  said Gomez.  We decided to have a little fun with this and thank moms who registered at Target by sending them a surprise \u2018First Target Run\u2019 onesie for their new baby. It was a huge hit and a way to bring a little extra joy to moms during this special time.  Of course, Target mania is not just a mom thing. With studies showing dads are more involved in their children\u2019s lives than ever (and the growing number of same-sex couples raising kids), it\u2019s no surprise many fathers are tweeting about their Target runs, too.   Usually I feel great because I can pick up anything I want there, and there\u2019s a location everywhere. So I can stop on my way home from work, or when I\u2019m just trying to get my kids out of the house for a bit,  Coffron told HuffPost.  Let\u2019s drink this Icee while we look at bikes and Easter candy, and also pick up an entertainment center on our way to the checkout.   Coffron said he and his wife also go to Target on date nights.  We usually don\u2019t have much time with our kids being babysat, so we grab a quick dinner and then go to Target. We are pretty much hopeless romantics, I guess,  he said.  But seriously it\u2019s fun because we can goof off and be silly but also be efficient because we\u2019ll just buy light bulbs at the same time.  Reed said his 7-year-old daughter loves going to Target \u2015 especially because she loves the popular  L.O.L. Surprise!  dolls you can buy there.  The professor said he\u2019s more than happy to take her on his Target runs and occasionally indulge her with a toy.   Parenting is the hardest job on the planet. Period,  he said.  Anything that makes life a little easier, that brings a little bit of joy to a child vis-\u00e0-vis what the parent is doing \u2015 in this case, running errands \u2015 is seen as this fantastic elixir. It\u2019s fantastic. I can take her to Target and she\u2019ll be happy, and I can also do some shopping and get some stuff done.  Of course, there are always concerns about spending and unhealthful materialism when it comes to fanaticism around a specific brand, given that the underlying mission is to sell you more products.   Unfortunately this Target movement is centered around consumerism, so I can\u2019t say for sure if it\u2019s good or bad,  Morelli told HuffPost. But Tour\u00e9-Tillery believes those concerns don\u2019t really apply to a brand like Target.    I think if we were talking about a luxury brand that sells thousand-dollar shoes, then that would be more relevant to the discussion. But Target is not a luxury brand. You\u2019re going to buy toilet paper and yogurt because you need those kinds of things. And if you can go there and feel good about yourself and have fun in the process, it really doesn\u2019t get better than that.  To say it all boils down to materialism also ignores another big appeal of the Target experience, something money doesn\u2019t necessarily buy: community. Overworked parents \u2015 particularly moms, who still bear most of the burden when it comes to household responsibilities \u2015 find comfort in knowing they aren\u2019t alone and tend to seek a sense of community  Let\u2019s face it. Moms still do most of the shopping, so it makes sense that they would be the ones to have this fun [Target fan] club,  said Tour\u00e9-Tillery. Because women tend to be more active on social media than men are, it also makes sense that the social media component of Target fandom would seem more mom-focused.  A lot of moms actually gather at Target, so it provides some social support,  said Yiu. Jennifer White told HuffPost she finds a sense of comfort and community in her Target runs, even if she\u2019s only shopping with her children.  After my second child came along, errands became stressful, and overwhelming. Toting two young children, and all their supplies, suddenly I didn\u2019t run a quick errand anymore. Nothing was \u2018quick,\u2019  White said.  Many times when I attempted a cute, easy errand to Target and it turned into a migraine, I\u2019d see other moms and we\u2019d smile knowingly at each other, or we\u2019d make jokes over our kids\u2019 heads,  she added.  That felt something like the \u2018village\u2019 everyone wants but not all of us have.   "

            "text": "Model Winnie Harlow is sure as hell not a  vitiligo sufferer.   The 23-year-old Canadian model made her message clear in a Tuesday Instagram post blasting British tabloid the Evening Standard for describing her as a  vitiligo sufferer.    I\u2019m not a \u2018Vitiligo Sufferer.\u2019 I\u2019m not a \u2018Vitiligo model.\u2019 I am Winnie. I am a model. And I happen to have Vitiligo,  Harlow wrote in the caption.  Harlow has the skin condition vitiligo, which causes the loss of skin color in blotches. She burst onto the modeling scene in 2014 as a finalist on the show  America\u2019s Next Top Model.     Stop putting these titles on me or anyone else. I AM NOT SUFFERING!  Harlow continued.  If anything I\u2019m SUCCEEDING at showing people that their differences don\u2019t make them WHO they are! All our differences are apart of who we are but they don\u2019t define us! I\u2019m sick of every headline ending in \u2018Vitiligo Sufferer\u2019 or \u2018Suffers from Vitiligo.\u2019 Do you see me suffering?  Harlow has modeled for brands like Diesel and Desigual and has been featured in Vogue Italia, Ebony, Glamour and Cosmopolitan. In 2016, she was chosen as one of BBC\u2019s 100 Women.  The young model has made it clear she\u2019s very comfortable in her own skin, but wishes people would stop defining her as her skin condition. In a 2016 interview with Elle Canada, she explained that she wants to be known for more than just her vitiligo.   I\u2019m very sick of talking about my skin,  she said.  I am literally just a human. I have the same brain as you; there\u2019s a skeleton under my skin just like yours. It\u2019s not that serious.  She said that she\u2019s just  living life,  adding:  And if that inspires you, I\u2019m proud, but I\u2019m not going to put pressure on myself to be the best person in the world and tell everyone I have vitiligo. If you want to know about it, you can do your research. Either way, I\u2019m not in the dictionary under \u2018vitiligo.\u2019   Well said, Winnie.  "

            "text": "Customers at some 5,000 Walmart locations around the United States will no longer see Cosmopolitan magazine among the publications for purchase in the check-out line.  That\u2019s because the retail giant decided to remove the magazine so customers would not be exposed to its  sexually exploitative  content, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation said in a press release on Tuesday.   This is what real change looks like in our #MeToo culture, and NCOSE is proud to work with a major corporation like Walmart to combat sexually exploitative influences in our society,  said NCOSE executive director Dawn Hawkins. The conservative organization, formerly known as Morality in Media, has been targeting Cosmopolitan magazine for some time \u2015 long before the Me Too movement came about. NCOSE has even named its fight against the magazine  a longtime priority.  NCOSE argues that the magazine  relentlessly glamorizes things like public, anal, group, and violent sex to its young female readership  and that minors should be protected from such material. The content, NCOSE argues, goes against the organization\u2019s mission is to  defend human dignity and to oppose sexual exploitation.   We are grateful for Walmart\u2019s cooperation and for Walmart leadership\u2019s recognition that corporations must do their part to change #MeToo culture,  Hawkins added. In a statement to Newsweek, Walmart said the store would still carry Cosmopolitan, but just not locate issues in the checkout aisles.  While this was primarily a business decision, the concerns raised were heard,  the statement said.  Yet critics were quick to point out how removing the magazine in the name of the Me Too movement seemed misguided, counterproductive and opportunistic.   The real world took another step toward its slow and sure conversion to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale this week,  Vogue.com\u2019s Michelle Ruiz wrote.  I\u2019m embarrassed for Hawkins because she just broadcasted to the entire country that she is a woman who has no idea what #MeToo means. ICYMI: #MeToo is about unwanted sex and sexual attention, sexual assault, and harassment. While Cosmopolitan is a magazine and a brand best known for its sex tips (including my personal favorite, a suggestion to ring a donut on a guy\u2019s penis)\u2014it is all about consensual adult sex.  More people piled on with criticism over Twitter. Other retailers have moved to relocate or block Cosmo\u2019s racy covers in the past, though they didn\u2019t invoke the Me Too movement while doing so. In 2000, supermarket giant Kroger installed blinders on some of the magazine\u2019s covers in 2,200 stores. The magazine did not immediately return HuffPost\u2019s request for comment, but did provide a statement to Buzzfeed about the publication\u2019s success in serving female readers.  Cosmopolitan is the most successful global media brand for young women, with award-winning content produced by leading female journalists. With our focus on empowerment, we are proud of all that the brand has achieved for women around the world in the areas of equality, health, relationships, career, politics and social issues.   "

William Strampel is currently lodged at the Ingham County jail,  Ingham County Sheriff Scott Wriggelsworth told Reuters.  Wriggelsworth declined to say on what charges Strampel, 70, was arrested until the defendant was arraigned at a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday. A jail website listed the former dean of Michigan State\u2019s College of Osteopathic Medicine as an inmate there but gave no other information. The Detroit Free-Press newspaper reported that he faces multiple charges, at least one a felony. An attorney for Strampel, who has been on medical leave from the university since December, could not be reached by Reuters for comment on Monday evening. Michigan State University President John Engler said in February he was moving to revoke tenure for Strampel for failing to enforce 2014 guidelines created for Nassar in treating young athletes after complaints of sexual misconduct against him. The college has been criticized for its handling of complaints about Nassar stretching back for years. Michigan State terminated Nassar in September 2016 for his failure to follow those protocols, including having another person present when he performed the procedures. Numerous women said they were assaulted even after the guidelines were put in place. Nassar was sentenced in February to up to 125 years in prison after some 200 young women testified about decades of abuse at his hands. He had already received a sentence up to 175 years in a neighboring Michigan county, and was sentenced to a 60-year federal term for child pornography convictions.

The permit is set to expire March 31, but Uber indefinitely halted its autonomous vehicle testing nationwide following a fatal crash last Sunday night in Tempe, Arizona. The collision killed 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg as she walked her bike across a road, and was the first fatal crash between an autonomous vehicle and a pedestrian.  In addition to this decision to suspend testing throughout the country, Uber has indicated that it will not renew its current permit to test autonomous vehicles in California,  California DMV deputy director and chief counsel Brian Soublet wrote to Uber. Uber confirmed the news in a statement to PBS NewsHour: Should Uber want to begin testing in California again, the company will need to re-apply for a permit, a process that will require it to provide a thorough explanation of the crash in Arizona, Soublet wrote in his letter.  Prior to resuming autonomous vehicle testing operations in California, Uber must apply for a new autonomous vehicle testing permit  he added.  Any application for a new permit will need to address any follow-up analysis or investigations from the recent crash in Arizona and may also require a meeting with the department.  In deciding to let its permit lapse in the state where it\u2019s headquartered, Uber\u2019s decision carries more symbolic weight than strategic significance. The bulk of the company\u2019s testing takes place elsewhere. Uber\u2019s Advanced Technologies Group, the unit tasked with developing self-driving cars, is headquartered in Pittsburgh. Uber also has self-driving cars in Phoenix, San Francisco and Toronto. Uber was already on thin ice with California regulators. In 2016, the state gave Uber\u2019s self-driving cars the boot after the company refused to get government approval to test there. Instead of applying for the $150 permits, Uber shipped its autonomous Volvo SUVs to Arizona, where regulations are more relaxed. Unlike Arizona, California requires car companies to report how often human drivers have to take over from the autonomous system, a hard measure of just how capable the car\u2019s driving abilities really are. Given Uber\u2019s reported engineering struggles, it would be to the company\u2019s advantage to log more miles elsewhere. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) ordered the company to indefinitely suspend testing in his state Monday.  "

Fahmy lives in the suburbs of Houston, and one question she hears a lot \u2015 especially in the summer \u2015 is whether she\u2019s hot in her hijab. When she was younger, Fahmy said, she always felt like she needed to say  no.  She didn\u2019t want people to feel sorry for her, or to think the hijab was somehow oppressive. She also didn\u2019t want to  seem like a weirdo  for covering up in hot weather. But as an adult, Fahmy said, she\u2019s done trying to appease other people.  What do I care if they think I\u2019m hot? I\u2019m proud of my hijab. I\u2019d wear it no matter what,  Fahmy told HuffPost in an email.  But also, YES, I\u2019M HOT. It\u2019s 112 degrees out here, WE\u2019RE ALL HOT.  The 33-year-old is now the artist behind the popular Instagram account @YesImHotInThis, where she posts comics about life as an American Muslim woman. Fahmy\u2019s comics, which are often inspired by her own experiences, poke fun at married life and cultural taboos. She also uses humor to address misconceptions people have about women who wear the hijab. Her account depicts mundane yet meaningful slices of American life. There are comics about Fahmy\u2019s love of Girl Scout cookies and Rice Krispies Treats, her mission to declutter her house, and her efforts to exercise. But mixed in are comics about less lighthearted subjects \u2015 concerns about police surveillance of Muslim communities, for example, or being anxious about unwanted attention on public transportation. American Muslim women who wear the hijab often experience bigotry and hate. It\u2019s important to tell their stories, Fahmy said.  Muslim women don\u2019t often get a platform to tell our stories or share the silly \u2015 sometimes stressful \u2015 idiosyncrasies of our day-to-day lives,  she said.  Fahmy has found web comics an  incredibly useful  way to share stories about Muslim life.  They\u2019re short, to the point, and usually get people to chuckle,  she said.  They make people laugh and think.  The self-taught artist started posting her comics online in March 2017. A year later, she\u2019s accumulated more than 145,000 followers on Instagram.  Fahmy has recently started reaching out to other Muslim women cartoonists on Instagram in an effort to elevate more women\u2019s voices. With these collaborations, she\u2019s hoping to highlight the themes of solidarity in sisterhood, fighting Islamophobia, and breaking misconceptions about women who wear the hijab.   One thing I hope my comics do for my audience is to make them more aware of the marginalized folk around them,  she said.  Awareness gives way to understanding, which gives way to empathy, which gives way to compassion. And the world could definitely use a little more compassion.

            "text": "It\u2019s always been clear that President Donald Trump views women as commodities, pretty objects to be bought and sold. After all, this is a man who owned a beauty contest, openly rates women by their looks, and feels empowered enough by his fame and wealth that he\u2019s allegedly committed, and openly bragged of, sexual assault. Still, the revelations around his alleged affairs with adult film star Stormy Daniels, who told her story in explicit detail on  60 Minutes  Sunday night, and former model Karen McDougal are instructive. In their broadest outlines, the affairs actually look a lot like workplace sexual harassment: Men leverage their power to get sex, manipulating women who are looking for opportunities and advancement. In addition to some outrageous strong-arm tactics and possible violations of federal election law, Daniels and McDougal\u2019s stories \u2015 as well as that of former  Apprentice  contestant Summer Zervos \u2015 are classic examples of sexual harassment. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, fell into a  casting couch  harassment trap, the outlines of which resemble tactics used by so many of the men recently exposed by the Me Too movement. The move isn\u2019t terribly original: A powerful (and typically older) man uses the possibility of a new job or acting role to get sex. It\u2019s a sexual harassment play out of Hollywood\u2019s Golden Era, long solidified in the workplace. Though exposed and condemned by the Me Too era, it has hardly gone out of fashion. According to Daniels\u2019 account, Trump invited her to dinner \u2015 without mentioning that they\u2019d be eating alone in his private hotel room. She was just 27 years old and, by all accounts, extremely bright and ambitious. He was 60 years old, married with a new baby at home and a lot of money. Trump then went about using his more powerful position to seduce Daniels with a career opportunity \u2015 a role on his show  The Celebrity Apprentice.  Unlike disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, whose tactics allegedly included physical assault, Trump didn\u2019t force Daniels. She submitted to sex with him because, she told Cooper on  60 Minutes,  she felt she had no real choice in the matter.  I realized exactly what I\u2019d gotten myself into,  she said.  I had it coming for making a bad decision for going to someone\u2019s room alone.  Daniels insisted on Sunday night that her encounter with Trump was consensual, but it\u2019s clear who had the upper hand.  In the months and weeks following their original meeting, Trump continued to dangle a slot on the TV show in order to get Daniels to meet up with him again, according to Daniels\u2019 account. (Trump, through spokespeople, has repeatedly denied the affair.) When she finally did \u2015 showing up to his private bungalow at the Beverly Hills hotel \u2015 she did not sleep with him again. The next month, he called to let her know the TV show thing wasn\u2019t happening.  One wonders if she would have nabbed the role if she had succumbed to sex again. Trump unleashed a similar play on Summer Zervos, according to a lawsuit filed by the former  Apprentice  contestant. Zervos was also looking for a career opportunity and gladly accepted Trump\u2019s dinner invitation in 2007. But when she arrived at the restaurant of the Beverly Hills hotel, she was directed to Trump\u2019s private bungalow, according to her complaint. When she got there, she says Trump kissed her and placed his hand on her breast. She declined his advances, pushing him away. But after that, she says she kept seeking Trump out for advice and job opportunities. Zervos is now suing the president for defamation \u2015 after he called her a liar.  These stories recall so many Me Too tales: the young woman who says she showed up at Charlie Rose\u2019s home to talk about a job and was greeted by the elderly TV host wearing a robe with nothing underneath. Or venture capitalist Justin Caldbeck, who allegedly propositioned women who were looking to him to invest in their startups.   Karen McDougal says she was manipulated in a similar fashion. In order to get her to sign away the right to tell the story of her alleged affair with Trump, American Media Inc. promised the former model essentially a fresh start in her career, according to the lawsuit she filed against AMI. (The White House has denied that the affair happened.) AMI owns The National Enquirer, along with Star and OK magazines. According to McDougal\u2019s lawsuit, AMI representatives told her she\u2019d have the opportunity to write several columns each month on health and beauty for the publications, and could also appear on magazine covers.  What model wouldn\u2019t want that,  McDougal told Anderson Cooper in an interview last week.  Especially as an older model like, you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, this is great right?\u2019   Not exactly. The columns and covers didn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s now clear the company was just trying to keep her quiet about her alleged affair.  This was a sex and power exchange of a slightly different order \u2015 since Trump\u2019s involvement is not quite clear. Still, at the end of the day, AMI appears to have used McDougal\u2019s ambition to manipulate her. Now McDougal is suing AMI to get out of the contract. This isn\u2019t about money for her, she said.  I\u2019m out to get my rights back, to prove a contract was illegal, that I was taken advantage of and go back to my life. Period.  Considering the amount of scrutiny these women now face, it\u2019s doubtful they\u2019ll ever quite be able to go back to their lives. And that\u2019s one of the many horrid ways women lose when they speak up about harassment.  The three women\u2019s stories also raise the possibility, of course, that there are more out there. About a dozen women have already accused Trump of sexual misconduct. Harassment stories have been a little more scarce, but Trump clearly has a playbook. It\u2019s doubtful that he only used it a few times. "

            "text": "Aly Raisman is not here for any victim blaming. The Olympic gymnast and sexual abuse survivor made it clear in a series of tweets on Sunday that she does not believe banning leotards from gymnastics will prevent future abuse in the sport.   I was recently asked if gymnasts should continue wearing leotards,  she tweeted.  Leotards [are] not the problem. The problem is the many pedophiles out there & the adults who enable them. By saying clothing is part of the issue, [you] are victim shaming/implying survivors should feel it\u2019s their fault.   Recently, Raisman has been at the center of the sexual abuse scandal involving former USA Gymnastics trainer Larry Nassar. Nassar sexually abused Raisman, along with hundreds of other young athletes, under the guise of medical treatment for over two decades.  The scandal has forced not only USA Gymnastics but other Olympic sports organizations to reckon with how they handle sexual abuse and how it can be prevented in the future.  Rasiman directed her Twitter followers to her recent campaign Flip the Switch to learn more about victim shaming and how to prevent child sexual abuse.  Female gymnasts\u2019 leotards weren\u2019t always so form-fitting, according to a 2016 deep-dive from Elle. In the 1930s and \u201940s, gymnasts wore loose-fitting leotards that had full butt coverage and often covered their shoulders. At that time, however, gymnastics was less physical and consisted mostly of dancing. As the sport progressed, the leotard became more form-fitting to accommodate larger muscles and more physical routines.  The 23-year-old has long-been a feminist advocate who\u2019s used her platform time and time again to call out slut shaming and victim blaming. In a 2017 Instagram post, Raisman posted a photo of herself in a bathing suit and reminded her followers that women don\u2019t need to cover up to be respected.   Wear whatever makes you feel happy and confident,  Raisman wrote.  Don\u2019t EVER let anyone tell you how you should or shouldn\u2019t dress. We are all entitled to wear what we want. Females do not have to dress modest to be respected.   "

            "text": "Last week, France announced a bill to its Council of Ministers that would allow some of the sexual misbehaviors and crimes brought to light in recent months to be more easily punishable by law. There are four sections of the legislation: First, street harassment would be punished on the spot with a fine anywhere from 90 to 750 euros. Second, the law would set the age of sexual consent to 15. Third, the limitation period for sexual crimes committed against minors would be extended to 30 years (up from 20 years) after the victim turns 18. Finally, there would be tougher sanctions against online group harassment (this means that any person who takes part in harassing someone online, even if they just sent a few tweets, will be considered responsible). Though the Harvey Weinstein scandal, France\u2019s #BalanceTonPorc movement, and the worldwide Me Too movement have clearly put more attention on sexual assault worldwide, behind each of these pieces of legislation exists a person or a story that began debates in France long before these issues became daily top news stories.   In 2012, a Belgian woman named Sofie Peeters released a documentary called  Woman of the Street.  Using a hidden camera, she recorded and denounced sexist remarks and behaviors that she heard from men while simply walking down the street. Insults such as  bitch  and  slut  rained down on her, as well as indecent behavior and propositions. The young woman, then a student, said she was surprised that she experienced this kind of harassment  5 to 10 times a day.  As the French website Madmoizelle noted, the video\u2019s widespread impact caused politicians around Europe to react. The city of Brussels, for example, decided shortly thereafter that this type of sexual harassment would be punishable by law. Last Wednesday, the French government joined Brussels by proposing the establishment of a fine for street harassment and sexist insults.   In October 2016, French television and radio presenter Flavie Flament revealed in her book The Consolation that she had been raped by a well-known photographer (though she didn\u2019t reveal his name in the book) almost 30 years before. She explained to the JDD, a French weekly newspaper, that she withheld her aggressor\u2019s identity because of the  justice of the limitation concerning this type of crime.    Today this man is legally out of reach, yet that does not make him innocent. I cannot pursue my tormentor and I will live with this for the rest of my days,  she said.  Now her focus is on fighting to extend the limitation period for crimes committed against minors. In France, the period is 20 years if the victim is an adult, and if the victim is a minor at the time of the incident, it is up to 20 years after the victim turns 18. Minors thus have until age 38 to file a case. This is not enough time for some victims, who may suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or go years without realizing a crime they have suffered.  A victim of rape sometimes \u2018wakes up\u2019 many years after. For these people, coming out about what happened can take a long time. They may decide to pursue legal action after seeing a psychologist, which can be a long reconstructive effort,  explained Laure Ignace, a lawyer from the European Association Against Violence Directed at Women in the Workplace (AVWW), to the French paper Le Monde. Flament was given the task to work on extending the statute of limitations by Laurence Rossignol, the French minister of families, children and women\u2019s rights. She will also create a documentary,  Rape Against Minors,  to highlight the subject. Since then, nearly 30,000 people have signed a petition to extend the limitation period. In November 2017, Emmanuel Macron reiterated in his anti-violence against women proposal that the government should extend the period to 30 years for minors.   Concerning the age of consent for minors, the story that has created debates is rather recent, even if the subject itself is not. The acquittal of a man tried for the rape of an 11-year-old girl caused outrage in France in November 2017. Twenty years old at the time of the trial, the girl accused the man of rape, but the defendant stated it was consensual. He also asserted that she lied about her age, which she disputed. A similar affair sparked controversy in France two months earlier. A 28-year-old man was put on trial for  sexual abuse  and not  rape  after having sex with an 11-year-old. In France, punishment for the former is much lighter.  These two cases, particularly the one in November, raised numerous voices in favor of establishing an age of sexual consent, to distinguish the difference between children (those deemed unable to consent) and sexually consenting adults. Emannuel Macron asked for the age to be set to 15 during a speech on Nov. 27, 2017, shortly after the UN\u2019s International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women.  Marl\u00e8ne Schiappa, the Secretary of State for Equality between women and men has announced that, under a certain age, a minor should no longer be considered a consenting sexual adult.  Below a certain age, it should be considered that there can be no debate, ever, on the sexual consent of a child, and that for any child below a certain age, it would be automatically considered rape or sexual assault,  explains Schiappa, adding that this legal age could be somewhere  between 13 and 15.  Following a video on harassment published on Madmoizelle in May 2016, actress and YouTube personality Marion Seclin received a wave of insults and hate comments online. More than 40,000, according to Seclin. What was the reason for this surge of hate? The actress explained that the street was not a place to flirt.  It angered me that a large number of internet users decided not to debate with me, but come at me with insults. (...) I have received nearly 40,000 death and rape threats, people asking me to commit suicide, or threatening to kill my family, or other insults,  she later recounted. This case of online harassment brought to light the impunity available to harassers, as Seclin found herself destitute and with little possible recourse. In December 2017, she told her story at a TEDx conference and explained why she was  the French champion of cyberbullying.   Everything that happens online is happening in real life,  she said.  It\u2019s not me against 40,000 people, it\u2019s me against one person and one person and one person ... I do not have the time, nor the energy, nor the means to file a suit against 40,000 pseudonyms. Have you ever tried to file a case against someone? Do you know the administrative steps to file a case against someone in France? It is very long. So imagine 40,000 people,  she said during the talk, referring to the difficulty in pursuing legal action in France against cyberbullying. In February, a report from France\u2019s High Council of Equality between Women and Men (HCE) was submitted to the government with recommendations for ensuring cyberbullying would not go unpunished. In the bill, presented last Wednesday, a sanction appears that is related to the phenomenon of  mob mentality,  or when several people harass the same person together. The bill will still need to be voted on by French Parliament before it passes, but members of the French government are clearly trying to make major strides when it comes to protecting girls and women.

            "text": "(Reuters) - Remington Outdoor Co Inc., one of the largest U.S. makers of firearms, filed for bankruptcy protection on Sunday to carry out a debt-cutting deal with creditors amid mounting public pressure for greater gun control. The company listed assets in the range of $500 million to $1 billion and liabilities in the range of $500 million to $1 billion.  Remington, America\u2019s oldest gun maker, announced the deal in February to reduce its $950 million debtload in a deal that will transfer control of the company to creditors. The filing comes after a Feb. 14 shooting at a Parkland, Florida high school that killed 17 and spurred an intense campaign for gun control by activists. The massacre inspired hundreds of thousands of young Americans to lead huge U.S. anti-gun rallies on Saturday. In some of the biggest U.S. youth demonstrations for decades, protesters called on lawmakers and President Donald Trump to confront the issue. Voter registration activists fanned out in the crowds, signing up thousands of the nation\u2019s newest voters. Major U.S. companies and retailers have taken some steps to restrict firearm sales. Citigroup Inc said last week it will require new retail-sector clients to sell firearms only to customers who passed background checks and to bar sales of high-capacity magazines. Citi also said it was restricting sales for buyers under 21, a move adopted by other large retailers, while Kroger Co\u2019s superstore chain Fred Meyer said it will stop selling firearms entirely. Cerberus Capital Management LP, the private equity firm that controls Remington, will lose ownership in the bankruptcy. Remington\u2019s creditors, which sources told Reuters include Franklin Templeton Investments and JPMorgan Asset Management, will exchange their debt holdings for Remington equity. The creditors inked the debt-cutting deal prior to the Parkland shooting, and it is unclear if any have exited. The restructuring support agreement allows creditors to sell their holdings, but the buyer is bound by the deal. One investor told IFR, a Thomson Reuters news provider, that his firm had contemplated buying the Remington loans that will be exchanged into equity, which were offered at as low as 25 cents on the dollar.  We bowed out because we were uncomfortable,  he said. After a Remington Bushmaster rifle was used in the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in Connecticut in 2012 that killed 20 children and six adults, Cerberus tried unsuccessfully to sell Remington, then known as Freedom Group. Katie-Mesner Hage, an attorney representing Sandy Hook families in a lawsuit against Remington, said in a prepared statement that she did not expect the gun maker\u2019s bankruptcy would affect their case. Remington and other gunmakers have suffered from slumping sales in the past year as fears of stricter gun laws have faded. The chief executive of American Outdoor Brands Corp, maker of the Smith & Wesson gun used in the Parkland shooting, said on March 1 that some gun retailers reported increased sales after the Florida school shooting. Remington filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. "

            "text": "An evangelical Christian pastor has put forth a troubling suggestion for how to deal with the issues highlighted by sexual abuse survivors as part of the Me Too movement.  John Piper, an influential Baptist author and speaker and chancellor of a Christian college in Minnesota, claims that a return to traditional gender roles would help keep women safe from sexual abuse. Piper\u2019s definition of traditional gender roles involves women submitting to male leadership, and men accepting their God-given responsibility to protect these  weaker vessels.  This conservative Christian approach to gender relations is known as complementarianism.  In a recent podcast, Piper argued that society\u2019s departure from these traditional roles over the past 50 years has laid the groundwork for sexual abuse.  Egalitarian assumptions in our culture, and to a huge degree in the church, have muted \u2014 silenced, nullified \u2014 one of the means that God has designed for the protection and the flourishing of women,  Piper said, according a podcast transcript published on his website March 16. Complementarianism is not uncommon in conservative Christian circles. And Piper is not an outlier in American evangelicalism. In fact, he\u2019s scheduled to speak alongside some of the country\u2019s top evangelical leaders at a conference for pastors in Louisville, Kentucky, next month.  At the same time, Piper\u2019s claims have elicited strong criticism from some fellow Christians. Advocates for survivors of sexual abuse and their allies don\u2019t believe Piper\u2019s suggestion will bring about positive change. Indeed, they\u2019re worried this traditional way of thinking about women\u2019s roles is part of the problem. These advocates say Piper needs to do more to acknowledge the ways complementarian theology has been abused, especially in evangelical settings. Christa Brown, a clergy sex abuse survivor who blogs about abuse cover-ups in church settings, told HuffPost that Piper is endorsing a gender dynamic that can easily lead to exploitation and mistreatment. Many of the survivors she\u2019s worked with have told her they were  groomed  for abuse by a patriarchal theology that taught them to be submissive and obedient toward men.  Because complementarian theology promotes a power differential between men and women, it fosters the sort of abuse of power that devolves into sexual abuse,  Brown said. Piper\u2019s remarks were from an episode of his  Ask Pastor John  podcast, in which he fielded a question about the sexual abuse allegations that have emerged against several high-profile men as a result of the Me Too movement. Asked to share his thoughts on these abuse allegations, Piper responded by bringing up an age-old debate in Christian theology between two perspectives on gender relations \u2015 complementarianism and egalitarianism. In the complementarian view, men and women are equally treasured by God, but have distinct, divinely ordained roles. As spiritual heads of the household, men have final authority over women in both spiritual and practical matters. They are expected to exercise this authority in a self-sacrificial way \u2015 the way Christians believe Jesus gave his life for the church. Women, meanwhile, are expected to submit to their husbands at home, at church and, sometimes, in society. According to egalitarianism, however, neither men nor women are automatically granted headship. They are seen as spiritual equals in the eyes of God, and divide responsibilities based on their capabilities, rather than by gender. In his podcast, Piper claimed that egalitarianism is responsible for a breakdown of the structures that previously kept women safe. As more people embrace the idea that men and women are equal, he said, men have stopped feeling the need to  protect and honor  women. Piper argued that modern ideas of gender equality are actually partly to blame for the alleged abusive behavior of people like film producer Harvey Weinstein, comedian Louis C.K. and former Senate candidate Roy Moore.  It\u2019s a firm conviction of most of our egalitarian culture that men as men do not owe women a special kind of care and protection and honor that women do not owe men. I believe they do,  Piper said in the podcast.  I believe 50 years of denying it is one of the seeds bearing very bad fruit, including all those sexual abuses... talked about in [the listener\u2019s] question. There are other seeds in our culture, but this is one of the seeds.  Advocates for victims of abuse point out that theology emphasizing the authority of men has existed for centuries \u2015 but it\u2019s only since the advent of feminism and the emergence of Christian egalitarianism that Western society has progressed to a point where the abuse of women is understood to be unacceptable.   Piper references the last 50 years as the age of egalitarianism, and posits that it is the reason we are seeing sexual abuse happen,  Hannah Paasch, an ex-Christian blogger, told HuffPost in an email.  I would counter-point that sexual abuse has been happening for thousands of years, and the past 50 years of imagining alternate frameworks for gender and gender roles is in fact what has brought a centuries-old problem to light.  Paasch is one of the founders of #ChurchToo, a hashtag inspired by the Me Too movement that focuses on abuse in church settings. Paasch said she grew up immersed in evangelical culture, listening to Piper\u2019s sermons. She said that besides erasing the existence of trans and nonbinary people, complementariansim fails to take women\u2019s agency into account. It encourages men to decide what\u2019s best for women in a paternalistic manner. Ultimately, she believes, this theology  feeds the rape culture that we see permeating American Christianity today.    Perhaps in a perfect world men could protect women in a gentle and selfless manner, but that\u2019s just simply not what we see,  Paasch wrote.  When you hand one person a position of power over someone else \u2015 a position that they did not earn based on competency or merit but simply because of some attribute or descriptor they were assigned at birth \u2015 that power will inevitably be used for the person in power\u2019s benefit.  Piper has been criticized in the past for appearing to encourage evangelical women to  endure  abusive relationships for a season. He later clarified that he believes abusive husbands are  breaking God\u2019s law  and should be reported to civil authorities. Piper did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story. Ashley Easter is an advocate for victims of sexual abuse in church settings and the founder of the Courage Conference, an annual conference that brings survivors and advocates together. Easter told HuffPost that abuse is  always rooted in a lust for power, domination, and control.  She said she\u2019s never worked with a victim of abuse who did not experience some type of power asymmetry in the relationship.  The best way to defuse abuse is to instate an ethic of equality which upsets the power and control imbalance,  Easter told HuffPost in an email.  I have seen over and over again when these survivors found new equality-based relationships they were much safer and happier.  "

The elder Musk told The Sunday Times of London this weekend that he fathered a son with 30-year-old Jana Bezuidenhout, the daughter of his former wife Heide. Jana \u2015 who is Elon\u2019s younger stepsister \u2015 was 4 years old when her mother wed Errol, a union that lasted 18 years before the pair got divorced. Errol, 72, told the publication that he did not look on Jana as his stepdaughter because she lived away from the family for the majority of her childhood. He also said they reconnected more recently after Jana had gone through a breakup.  We were lonely, lost people,  he said.  One thing led to another \u2014 you can call it God\u2019s plan or nature\u2019s plan.  Errol does not live with Jana and the boy, 10-month-old Elliot Rush Musk, but has referred to the baby as an  exquisite child  and Jana as a  delightful girl and a wonderful mother.   According to The Daily Mail, Elon went  berserk  when he learned about the pairing, which isn\u2019t particularly surprising. The SpaceX CEO referred to his father as  a terrible human being  in a Rolling Stone interview in November 2017. Another of Errol\u2019s children, his daughter Alexandra  Ali  Musk (pictured below on a happier occasion), was apparently also upset at the news. Errol told The Daily Mail that when he informed his family that the baby was his, he  thought [Ali] would be supportive and understanding.  Instead, Errol said that Ali called him  insane, mentally ill  and that now his family believes he\u2019s  getting senile and should go into an old age home, not have a life full of fun and a tiny baby.

Loyola Chicago defeated Kansas State 78-62 Saturday night in a South regional final that wasn\u2019t ever particularly close, but still a lot of fun for everyone not wearing purple. The Ramblers used a combination of surgical interior slices and backbreaking three-pointers to disrupt K-State from every angle, and the Wildcats had no reliable answer on either end of the court. Now, the unlikeliest story of the 2018 NCAA Tournament gets another chapter. Loyola began its second half against Nevada on Thursday night shooting an ungodly \u2013 wait, let\u2019s not use that word for Sister Jean\u2019s team; let\u2019s say  impressive  \u2013 13-for-13. The Ramblers followed that up by draining their first nine shots from the field on Saturday, kicked off by Cameron Krutwig. Sidelined much of Thursday night with foul trouble, Krutwig threw his beef into the fray Saturday night, thundering for seven crucial points and five rebounds at the half. On the other end of the spectrum, Kansas State couldn\u2019t get anything started on offense, and couldn\u2019t slow Loyola on defense. Barry Brown Jr. was a slashing marvel, and Xavier Sneed filled the hoop from outside, but they were the lone highlights from the KSU side. The Wildcats couldn\u2019t catch up to Loyola\u2019s slash-and-pass game, and even on the rare instances when K-State could force Loyola into turnovers, the deficit didn\u2019t shrink to any less than five. The score at the half: Loyola 36, K-State 24. The teams traded baskets early in the second half, a time when trading baskets simply would not do for K-State. The minutes shrank and the deficit didn\u2019t. The key moment, emotionally speaking, came with just under 17 minutes remaining in the game. Krutwig kicked the ball out to Richardson beyond the arc; K-State\u2019s Kamau Stokes charged out toward him, but couldn\u2019t get there before Richardson released the ball, and couldn\u2019t stop after. Three-point bucket, and-1 shot Richardson lay on the floor and spread out his arms and legs, starfish style, a broad grin on his face. And the hits kept on coming. A Donte Ingram two-pointer got changed to a three during an official timeout; Loyola was so good at scoring it was putting points on the board even during commercials. Krutwig rolled in an ugly-but-still-good layup, Custer hit a long three-pointer, and Ingram sliced right through the bewildered K-State defense for an up-and-under bucket, and suddenly Loyola was up by 19 with 14 minutes remaining, and even the most pessimistic of souls started to dare to hope. The chants of  L-U-C!  from the Gryffindor-scarved Rambler faithful grew louder and louder as K-State\u2019s hopes of a miracle comeback grew dimmer and dimmer. Kansas State\u2019s offensive sets fell into a depressing pattern of one-shot-and-gone; at the other end of the court, Loyola seemed able to finger-roll in featherlight shots from anywhere on the court. The deficit was a wall too high to climb. Even when Kansas State put together a 10-0 run with about five minutes left in the game, the Wildcats were still down 13. Richardson halted that run with another three-pointer, his sixth of the night on seven shots, and K-State\u2019s shoulders visibly sagged. And when Stokes\u2019 own attempt at a clutch three ringed the hoop and inexplicably popped out: \u2026well, that was about it for the Wildcats. Loyola began stretching the floor and devouring clock, and Kansas State could only foul and hope. Kansas State can look back on this tournament with pride, having knocked off one of the nation\u2019s marquee programs in Kentucky on Thursday night. But Loyola\u2019s got a lot more to look forward to. We\u2019re not through with you yet, Sister Jean.   Read more from Yahoo Sports: This story was originally published on Yahoo Sports. "

            "text": "In the weeks leading up to the 2017 Women\u2019s March, thousands of people knitted pink yarn hats, dubbed the  pussy hat,  as a symbol of solidarity for protestors across the world united in a quest for equality. And this weekend, at the March 24 March for our Lives events scheduled to take place in Washington, D.C., and in cities across the country \u2014 where protesters will encourage lawmakers to enact more sensible gun-violence prevention legislation \u2014 there may also be pussy hats. But the headlining accessory this time around is a pair of knit gloves with  evil eyes  sewn into the palms. Krista Suh, who created the Pussyhat Project, spearheaded this initiative for the upcoming gun control march, inspired by the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Her goal is to collect 438 pairs of gloves, to represent the 438 people killed or injured in school shootings from 2014 through today.  Individually, to show the eye on the palm, you can put out your hand in a \u2018stop\u2019 gesture \u2014 as in we must stop gun violence; enough is enough. In a group, you can raise your hands above your head to show the eyes \u2014 this is the universal gesture of \u2018hands up don\u2019t shoot\u2019 and a reminder of how vulnerable our children are in a country with weak gun control,  Suh\u2019s website reads. She says it\u2019s in perfect in alignment with women\u2019s issues, a cause she felt passionately about after the 2016 presidential election.  Women\u2019s rights are human rights, and there are a lot of issues specific to women \u2014 elder care, health care, and yes, gun control. We are mothers, students, and teachers, so I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any issue that is off limits for women to advocate for,  she tells Yahoo Lifestyle. While the meaning behind the  pussy hat  is more easily deconstructed \u2014 both a nod to President Trump\u2019s comments about grabbing women and to the cat ears knitted into the headwear \u2014 the evil eye gloves are perhaps less obvious in their symbolism.  The evil eye is the symbol of protection, just like the pussy hat was a symbol of protection for women who went to [Washington] D.C. to march,  Suh explains.  These eyes are meant to show that people are watching \u2014 history is watching \u2014 what Congress will do next. I think it\u2019s really powerful.  Of course, not everyone offered glowing endorsements of those pink hats. They were called vulgar, pointless, and gender normative. As of yet, the evil eye gloves haven\u2019t caused as loud a stir, likely because they\u2019ve been a recurring motif in fashion for years. On Fall 2016 runways, for instance, Givenchy and Alexander McQueen both showed collections with evil eyes and the Eye of Horus on garments and accessories. There are entire sections on retailers\u2019 websites devoted to evil eye jewelry.  If you\u2019re going to talk about the evil eye, you\u2019ve also got to talk about hands,  wrote Racked in 2016.  The hamsa hand may be the most popular \u2014 and ancient \u2014 protective symbol against the evil eye. An open hand with an eye in the palm, this design has origins in the Babylonian Empire as an emblem of its goddess, Inanna. \u2026 Cultures the world over agreed on one thing: This amulet embodied female power.  So maybe those knit gloves do make sense.  As for whether protest fashion encourages  slacktivism  \u2014 the idea that throwing on a T-shirt with the slogan of any given cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre replaces measurable political action \u2014 Suh, for obvious reasons, isn\u2019t so harsh to those who aren\u2019t ready to run for office but might be ready to knit a pair of gloves.  Clothing items are symbolic, but they\u2019re also a gateway to larger action,  Suh says.  Also, it\u2019s important to let people know they\u2019re not alone \u2014 that they don\u2019t have to work in a vacuum when other people are visible and brave enough to show themselves.

Artist Kristen Visbal is selling two-foot reproductions of the famous statue of a young girl facing off against Wall Street\u2019s  Charging Bull.  The miniature reproductions each cost a whopping $6,500 and will be sold as a limited edition, with only 1,000 made in total.  My hope is that your limited edition bronze will serve as a symbol of empowerment and encouragement and as a reminder that collaboration between genders and culture is the enlightened path forward for smarter, stronger decisions,  Visbal wrote on the Fearless Girl website.  According to the website, 20 percent of the proceeds from sales of the statues will go to nonprofits that support women\u2019s education and gender equality.  The original statue was erected last March in New York City by asset management group State Street Global Advisors to  increase gender diversity  and celebrate women leaders in business. In October 2017, it was revealed by the Department of Labor that State Street Global had paid women and black executives less than their white male counterparts. State Street Global Advisors agreed to pay $5 million back to over 300 women and 15 black employees.  While the statue ended up being another empty feminist symbol created by capitalism, the statue was a hit with many people and created conversations about female empowerment in different workspaces.  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio commended Visbal and the statue last March:  In her short time here, the Fearless Girl has fueled powerful conversations about women in leadership and inspired so many.   Although the statue is pricy, Visbal told CNN Money that she\u2019s considering selling smaller reproductions at a more affordable price. The current model will be sold in a  butterscotch brown  color with a base made of black granite. The production time to create a reproduction will take three to four months.

            "text": "Former Vice President Joe Biden was speaking at a rally against sexual violence on Tuesday night when he said he would have  beat the hell out of  President Donald Trump in high school for the way he treats women.  It was an odd sentiment, though Biden\u2019s comments were met with laughter and applause from the crowd. And, of course, Trump responded.   Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy. Actually, he is weak, both mentally and physically, and yet he threatens me, for the second time, with physical assault,  Trump tweeted Thursday morning.  He doesn\u2019t know me, but he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way. Don\u2019t threaten people Joe!  As most things on the internet do, the feud \u2015 between two grown men over 70 years old, might I add \u2015 was retweeted, turned into a meme and quickly went viral. People on both sides of the aisle defended their party\u2019s politician and dragged his opponent.  While I welcome any non-lady feud, there\u2019s something troubling about the root of Biden\u2019s and Trump\u2019s comments. Biden boasted about beating up the president while he was at a rally against sexual violence for his organization It\u2019s On Us. He later bizarrely suggested that men who treat women poorly are likely to be physically unattractive, essentially fat-shaming Trump.  Biden declined to comment further on his remarks through a spokesman. Trump\u2019s response \u2015 specifically pointing out that Biden is  weak  both  mentally and physically  \u2015 is a clear sign that Trump felt his masculinity was threatened by Biden\u2019s remarks. Both comments are peak toxic masculinity: Biden attempted to defend the honor of women with his brawny man strength and Trump responded to violence with more violence.  This macho rhetoric is, in fact, the root cause of the very issue Biden is campaigning against with It\u2019s On Us. Responding to violence against women with more violence is wildly problematic. This feud, but specifically Biden\u2019s initial comments, are exemplary of how men feel they need to prove themselves through violent or sexual acts to be seen as  real men.   Toxic masculinity \u2015 the concept that men are confined to strict gender roles that perpetuate violent and overly sexualized behavior \u2015 is often the very reason for rampant sexual violence on college campuses and around the country.  When Biden essentially challenges Trump to a duel, he perpetuates the myth that women need good guys to protect them from the bad guys. In fact, what all sexual assault survivors need, but especially women, is to be seen as humans. Once women are seen as equals, they can no longer be used as objects men can consume haphazardly to make them look more manly to other men.  It\u2019s safe to say that Trump\u2019s track record with women is much worse than Biden\u2019s. The president, who once bragged about grabbing women  by the pussy,  has been accused of sexual misconduct, ranging from harassment to assault and rape, by 21 women. Trump regularly denies allegations of sexual and domestic abuse against not only him but also his former staffers as  fake news.  Biden has a somewhat storied history with his treatment of women. The former vice president, who launched It\u2019s On Us with President Barack Obama in 2014, has long advocated for women\u2019s rights, including drafting the Violence Against Women Act of 1994. He has, however, been widely criticized for how he handled professor Anita Hill\u2019s accusations of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas during the latter\u2019s 1991 Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Many people believe that Biden, who was then chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, didn\u2019t do enough to ensure those allegations were given full consideration. More recently, Biden has taken on the good old  Uncle Joe  persona, during which time he has been caught on camera being creepy and borderline inappropriate toward women.  While Biden\u2019s behavior toward women is nowhere near that of Trump\u2019s, his recent actions call into question his understanding of rape culture and the root cause of sexual violence on college campuses. I think I can speak for most women when I say: Please, men, don\u2019t use women and our bodies as a pawn to boost your ego.  "

            "text": "Years-old sexual abuse allegations against a former Mormon missionary leader were published on a whistleblowing website this week, prompting a public pledge from the Utah-based church that it would discipline the alleged perpetrator if the claims were found to be true. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said in a statement Tuesday that it is looking into  deeply disturbing  allegations against Joseph Bishop, who served as president of a Mormon missionary training center in Provo, Utah, in the 1980s.  A 55-year-old woman has accused Bishop of sexually assaulting her in 1984 while she was training to be a missionary. The woman claims Bishop raped her at the center, according to a Brigham Young University police report obtained by HuffPost. The woman\u2019s name has not been disclosed in the press or in the police report. Bishop was the president at the Missionary Training Center (MTC) in Provo from 1983 to 1986. An MTC is where the LDS church trains thousands of young men and women before they are sent out as missionaries to countries across the world.   If the allegations of sexual assault are true, it would be a tragic betrayal of our standards and would result in action by the Church to formally discipline any member who was guilty of such behavior, especially someone in a position of trust,  the church said in its statement. The church\u2019s statement came days after a taped conversation between Bishop and the woman was posted to MormonLeaks, a website started by ex-Mormons seeking to increase transparency within the LDS church. Last December, the woman posed as a reporter and secretly recorded an interview she had with Bishop in Arizona. During the wide-ranging conversation, she asked Bishop questions about the alleged assault and about other women he may have harassed. The Mormon leader, who is now 85 years old, can be heard saying he doesn\u2019t remember assaulting the woman and muses that maybe it\u2019s  because my mind doesn\u2019t want me to remember that.  At one point in the interview, the woman asked if Bishop molested another Mormon woman at the MTC. He admits that he gave one woman a back rub that got too  frisky.  He apologizes repeatedly in the recording and says that for years he has struggled with a  sexual addiction.     I am very, very sorry and I am so sorry. I don\u2019t know if I can even be forgiven on your side,  Bishop tells the woman in the recording. The woman also contacted Brigham Young University police in November to report her alleged assault. According to that police report, Bishop denied the rape allegations but told detectives that he\u2019d gone with the woman to a small  preparation room  and while talking with her  asked her to show him her breasts, which she did.   BYU police relayed the facts of the case to the Utah County attorney\u2019s office. Deputy attorney David Sturgill replied that he could not pursue criminal charges against Bishop because the statute of limitations had expired four years after the alleged assault.   I have no reason to doubt the victim\u2019s disclosure, and would have likely prosecuted Mr. Bishop, but for the expiration of the statute of limitations,  Sturgill informed BYU police, according to the police report. BYU police closed their investigation into the assault on Dec. 23.  The woman told the LDS church-owned Deseret News that she first reported the assault to church officials around 1988. The church\u2019s official statement on Tuesday claimed officials became aware of the alleged assault in 2010, when the woman informed leaders of a Mormon congregation in Pleasant Grove, Utah, where she was living.  The LDS church claims the leaders  listened carefully to the claims being made  and then relayed them to the Pleasant Grove Police Department. The church claims it received no further communication from the police about the matter. Church leaders also contacted Bishop, who denied the allegations. Unable to verify the woman\u2019s claims, the church said it decided not to discipline Bishop at the time. According to The Salt Lake Tribune, the woman made a threat about killing Bishop in 2010. Pleasant Grove police interviewed the woman and decided not to make an arrest. In January, the woman\u2019s lawyer forwarded the recorded conversation to the LDS church. The church claims both the woman and Bishop were then interviewed about the allegations. Both parties reaffirmed their positions and appeared to have  dramatically  different recollections of what happened in 1984. Bishop\u2019s family claims that the woman who made the accusations is untrustworthy and has falsely accused other men of sexual assault. His son, Greg Bishop, said his father was confused during the woman\u2019s interview, since he was recovering from a heart surgery that took place two days earlier. The son added that when his father admitted to having a  sexual addiction,  he was referring to a lifelong battle with  controlling  his  sexual thoughts.   Those people who know dad don\u2019t put much credence in these allegations,  Greg Bishop told the AP. The church cautioned in its statement that it does not have the  investigative tools  available to law enforcement agencies to conduct a thorough review of the matter, but pledged to keep Bishop accountable for any misconduct.  The Church is continuing its investigation of this individual\u2019s claims and will act consistent with its long-standing policy of no tolerance for abuse.  "

Krish Vignarajah, one of eight Democrats vying to challenge GOP incumbent Gov. Larry Hogan in this year\u2019s elections, uses the 30-second ad to highlight Maryland\u2019s lack of women in statewide or federal offices. A woman in an elected position isn\u2019t just about representation, she says in the ad.  It\u2019s about policy. States with women in government have better schools, better health care, lower incarceration rates. I want all of that for Maryland,  Vignarajah tells viewers. Vignarajah is at least the second gubernatorial candidate in this year\u2019s elections to feature breastfeeding in campaign advertising \u2015 a strong statement that women can be mothers and have prominent public-service careers. Kelda Roys, a Democratic candidate for Wisconsin governor, began running ads this month that show her breastfeeding. Vignarajah\u2019s ad goes on to talk of her parents who immigrated to America with $200, and how she became policy director for former first lady Michelle Obama.   Some say no man can beat Larry Hogan,  Vignarajah says in the ad.  Well, I\u2019m no man. I\u2019m a mom. I\u2019m a woman. And I want to be your next governor.   Hogan is only the second Republican to be Maryland\u2019s governor in nearly 50 years, and his approval ratings have been high.  Roys\u2019 ad in Wisconsin strikes a note similar to Vignarajah\u2019s.  I am a mom, and that\u2019s a big reason why I am motivated to run for governor. I cannot have my children growing up in a world where we don\u2019t value public education and we are destroying natural resources,  Roys says.  What sets me apart from the rest of the field is not that I have a baby, but I have a track record of getting things done, of accomplishing progressive policies for people of this state.  The movement to normalize breastfeeding continues to gain momentum, with some big-name celebrities also spotlighting the act. "

The move, announced this week, has already been condemned by some firearm enthusiasts as overreaching censorship. Others applauded the company \u2015 the world\u2019s largest video platform \u2015 for taking a stand in the wake of last month\u2019s Parkland, Florida, high school massacre. YouTube, a division of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, outlined the new guidelines on its website Monday without fanfare. Bloomberg was first to report the shift on Wednesday. Under the new rules, to be enforced starting in April, YouTube will prohibit videos that link to sites selling firearms or gun accessories. Instructional videos containing information about how to build guns also will be restricted. A YouTube spokeswoman told The Wall Street Journal the company several years ago banned videos explicitly promoting the sale of firearms, but recently decided to expand the restrictions.  We routinely make updates and adjustments to our enforcement guidelines across all of our policies,  the spokeswoman said.  YouTube in October began removing videos showing how to modify firearms with bump stocks following the massacre in Las Vegas that left 58 people dead and hundreds injured. The shooter used the gun attachment on his rifles, allowing him to fire much more quickly. A cursory search on Thursday revealed tens of millions of videos on YouTube teaching viewers how to make guns (both real and toy varieties) and firearm accessories like silencers. The expanded restrictions are provoking an outcry from gun advocates, according to conservative media outlets. Some accused the site of  Big Brother  censorship, while others criticized the guidelines as vague.  Their policies are not very clear-cut and they are arbitrary,  Karl Kasada, co-owner of InRange TV, a YouTube channel featuring firearm videos, told the Journal.  You never know when you are going to get hit by them.  InRange TV said on Facebook this week that the channel will be moving its content to the porn website PornHub following YouTube\u2019s change.  PornHub has a history of being a proactive voice in the online community, as well as operating a resilient and robust video streaming platform,  InRange TV\u2019s post said.  YouTube posted its policy change less than a week before March For Our Lives, a gun control rally organized by survivors of the Parkland massacre. More than a half-million people are expected to attend the protest Saturday in Washington and in other cities.  "

Toys R Us filed for bankruptcy in September. In a tweet, the company announced Lazarus\u2019 death, saying there had been  many sad moments  recently but none more upsetting than the death of its founder. Lazarus founded Toys R Us in June 1957, nine years after he opened his first baby furniture and toy store in Washington, D.C., called Children\u2019s Bargain Town. After nearly a decade running Children\u2019s Bargain Town, Lazarus restructured his business, decided to focus solely on toys and reformatted the store to take after a supermarket, so customers could see open shelves of toys and place desired items in shopping carts. In the \u201980s, Toys R Us went international, opening locations all over the world. During the company\u2019s closing announcement last week, administrators for the retailer said it planned to close all 75 stores in the U.K. The widespread shutdowns will affect roughly 3,000 employees in the U.K., and about 31,000 in the U.S. There are 791 remaining Toys R Us locations in America. The company had about $5 billion in long-term debt when it filed for bankruptcy in September. When Toys R Us first entered Chapter 11, it had an ambitious plan to restructure and reemerge a healthy business. But after a weak holiday season performance coupled with intense competition from rivals including Amazon, Target and Walmart seemed to do the company in, according to USA Today. Lazarus had no stake in Toys R Us at the time of his death, CNN reported, but the toy industry titan served as CEO of the business until 1994.  In a statement to HuffPost, a Toys R Us spokesperson reiterated the sadness the company felt after Lazarus\u2019 death, adding,  He visited us in New Jersey just last year and we will forever be grateful for his positive energy, passion for the customer and love for children everywhere.

            "text": "Former professional hockey player Larry Kwong died this past Thursday at age 94 in Calgary, Canada.  The Chinese-Canadian athlete, the son of Chinese immigrants, was a pioneer in his sport, becoming the first person of color to play in the National Hockey League.   I broke the ice a little bit,  Kwong told The New York Times in 2013.  Maybe being the first Chinese player in the N.H.L. gave more of a chance for other Chinese boys that play hockey.  Kwong played just one major league game with the New York Rangers on March 13, 1948, after being called up from the New York Rovers farm team, and battled racism and discrimination on his way to the NHL.  The hockey player was born in Vernon, British Columbia, in 1923, the year Canada passed the Chinese Immigration Act. The legislation, enacted during a time of fierce anti-Chinese sentiment across the country, essentially banned all forms of Chinese immigration and wasn\u2019t repealed for more than two decades. Kwong, whose parents ran a grocery store, quickly became aware of the racism in the country. Chinese-Canadians were denied the right to vote, Kwong couldn\u2019t find a job in his hometown, and barbers even refused to cut his hair because of his ethnicity.  When I was a young boy, I couldn\u2019t just go to any barber shop. They won\u2019t take me because I was Chinese. It didn\u2019t make me feel good,  Kwong recalled, according to CHBC.  It made me feel that I can\u2019t just go to a certain place or restaurant. I would have to make sure they don\u2019t mind and let me go in.   Hockey became an escape for Kwong, The New York Times mentioned. And he joined his first organized team, the Vernon Hydrophones, in the late 1930s. He later moved up to the Trail Smoke Eaters, a team that promised its players a high-paying gig at a local smelter. The Chinese-Canadian player, however, was denied the job due to his heritage and was instead given work as a hotel bellhop.  Kwong was drafted into the military during World War II, playing hockey to entertain the troops while also building minesweepers in the shipyard. Later on, a scout finally noticed Kwong\u2019s talent for the sport at a Rangers tryout camp and Kwong landed a spot on the Rovers.  Though Kwong became the team\u2019s top scorer in his second year with the team, he witnessed many other players get called up to the Rangers before him, The Globe and Mail noted. When he finally got the chance to play for the major league team, he was given just one minute on the ice.   Just a minute. So what can you do in a minute? Unless you\u2019re a real magician, what can you do in a minute?  he told the Multicultural History Society of Ontario.  Kwong left the NHL at the end of the season but continued playing several successful years in the Quebec Senior Hockey League and later overseas.  After his sports career, he returned to his family\u2019s grocery business, retiring in 1996. Kwong\u2019s legacy in the sports world was solidified by his 2010 induction into the B.C. Hockey Hall of Fame and his 2013 induction in to the B.C. Sports Hall of Fame in Vancouver, among many other accolades. The pioneer is survived by a sister, daughter and two grandchildren.  "

            "text": "The winter-weary can get their fill of sun and surf at Broadway\u2019s Marquis Theatre, where the Jimmy Buffett jukebox musical,  Escape to Margaritaville,  opened to an enthusiastic (and woozy) crowd last week. It\u2019s easy to dismiss the Caribbean-themed show \u2013 which features the Buffett classics  It\u2019s Five O\u2019Clock Somewhere,   Cheeseburger in Paradise  and, of course,  Margaritaville  \u2013 as escapist fantasy. But one of the stars, Lisa Howard, believes audiences who dig a little deeper in the sand will discover a heartfelt message of empowerment and body positivity. The singer-actress plays Tammy, a beleaguered bride-to-be who accompanies her best friend, Rachel (Alison Luff), to an island resort for a bachelorette week filled with stiff cocktails and sinewy men. With each tropical sunset, however, Tammy questions whether she\u2019ll be content marrying her uncouth fianc\u00e9 (Ian Michael Stuart) as she falls for a sweet-natured bartender, Brick (Eric Petersen). True to Broadway musical tradition, Tammy\u2019s inevitable self-discovery features a great dress, a high-flying solo number and, of course, a happy ending.    She really ends up finding her self-worth,  Howard told HuffPost.  You see her go on that journey. I think it\u2019s important to be telling stories that empower women, especially nowadays, because it hasn\u2019t always been the case. The more examples we, as artists, can show in the world, and the women see that reflected in art, the more empowered they\u2019ll feel to speak out, say something, make a statement and stand up for themselves.  Buffett, Howard said, was a  great presence  throughout the development of the show.  It\u2019s been a pleasure to get to know him,  she explained.  He\u2019s kind of like you\u2019d think he\u2019d be. He\u2019s very chill, but he\u2019s a very smart, passionate businessman. He\u2019s taken this idea \u2015 this culture of island life \u2015 and run with it.   Howard boasts an enviable theatrical r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that includes  South Pacific  and  Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.  The Akron, Ohio, native\u2019s film career got a significant boost in 2012, when she appeared as a vampire in  The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn \u2013 Part 2.  The secret to her success, she said, has been picking roles written for plus-sized women like herself that don\u2019t hinge on a weight-loss narrative and aren\u2019t intended as comic relief. She said opportunities for plus-sized stars have expanded in both film and theater in the 18 years since she made her Broadway debut in  The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee.  (Witness, for example, Keala Settle\u2019s breakout turn in the movie musical  The Greatest Showman,  which turned out to be a surprise hit this winter.)   I\u2019ve just been blessed to have been a part of projects where my looks or my size don\u2019t matter,  Howard, who also is a plus-size fashion model, said.  These are lead roles I\u2019m playing. I\u2019m not just the funny sidekick or the character actor. \u2026 The diversity of the actual population, I feel, is being more represented. I\u2019m glad that I\u2019m a part of that.  Howard is best known for the 2015 Broadway musical,  It Shoulda Been You,  in which she played a wallflower bridesmaid who takes her romantic fate into her own hands as her sister\u2019s wedding plans unravel. Many critics saw the comedy, directed by  Frasier  veteran David Hyde Pierce, as a breakout moment for Howard. Her sultry song,  Jenny\u2019s Blues,  was one of the show\u2019s highlights, and has become popular on the cabaret circuit. Watch Howard perform  Jenny\u2019s Blues  on the 2015 Tony Awards below.   It Shoulda Been You  gave Howard a signature tune, but the musical struggled to find an audience and closed after just 135 performances. That experience, however, forced her to explore new, less-heralded realms. She was invited to read for a workshop version of  Escape to Margaritaville  soon afterward.  I don\u2019t fit into anyone else\u2019s mold,  said Howard, who names Mama Rose in  Gypsy  as a dream role.  Sometimes it\u2019s just a matter of persistence. You say yes to every opportunity, and keep putting yourself out there, so that people recognize what you have to offer, and where you fit in.   Regardless of how  Escape to Margaritaville  fares with critics, Howard hopes Buffett fans, or  Parrot Heads,  will take the time to check out the musical.  In spite of the craziness in the world right now, I hope they come [to the show] to escape, relax and enjoy a good love story,  she said.  You can take with you no matter what you do.  Lisa Howard stars in  Escape to Margaritaville,  now playing in New York.  CORRECTION: The original version of this article misspelled Ian Michael Stuart\u2019s surname.  "

            "text": "After a riotous week full of revelations that Facebook enabled a shadowy British firm called Cambridge Analytica to harvest and exploit the personal information of more than 50 million users \u2015 then failed to follow up on it for more than two years \u2015 CEO Mark Zuckerberg offered an off-camera act of contrition Wednesday, yet no apology. In the missive, Zuckerburg acknowledged there\u2019s been  a breach of trust  between Facebook and its users. He outlined several steps he hopes will restore public trust in the company, all aimed at clarifying and restricting which apps have access to which types of data. Facebook also said it will investigate the apps on the platform that had access to large amounts of user data prior to 2014, before the company began limiting developers\u2019 access. It plans to ban those found to be in violation of Facebook\u2019s terms and notify affected users, including those affected by Cambridge Analytica.  We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can\u2019t then we don\u2019t deserve to serve you,  wrote Zuckerberg, who is scheduled to appear in an interview on CNN Wednesday night. Notably, while Zuckerberg acknowledges Facebook made  mistakes,  his post stops short of anything resembling an apology.  Zuckerberg also failed to clarify how, exactly, Cambridge Analytica held onto and kept using the harvested data for a full two years after Facebook learned Cambridge had acquired it. He does offer the feeble defense that Facebook asked for, and received, a formal certification from the company verifying it deleted the data, but it was clearly insufficient.  In a separate post, Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg went a step further, stating she  deeply regrets  how Facebook handled Cambridge Analytica \u2015 but again, it\u2019s no apology.  You deserve to have your information protected \u2015 and we\u2019ll keep working to make sure you feel safe on Facebook,  she wrote.  Your trust is at the core of our service. We know that and we will work to earn it.  It\u2019s been a response several days in the making, as neither Zuckerberg nor Sandberg offered so much as a peep earlier this week as the allegations piled up and Facebook\u2019s stock tanked. Both were absent from an internal briefing about the situation Tuesday (though they were never scheduled to appear in the first place). And while Zuckerberg was expected to speak at an all-hands meeting Friday, it seems that\u2019s been bumped up a day or two. Translation of Zuckerberg\u2019s Wednesday post: He is super serious, you guys. This time, he promises it\u2019ll be different. Not like last time, in September, when he appeared before cameras and pledged Facebook would do a better job self-regulating and  create a new standard for transparency in online political ads.  (That particular acknowledgment was only prompted by the revelation that more than half of all eligible voters in the U.S. were exposed to and interacted with Russian propaganda on Facebook between June 2015 and August 2017.) Or the time before that, in July 2017, when a Facebook spokesperson flat-out told CNN  we have seen no evidence that Russian actors bought ads on Facebook in connection with the election.  (Just two weeks later, Facebook revealed it had found more than 3,000 such ads, bought and paid for by a Russian group known as the Internet Research Agency.) Or the time before that, in November 2016, when Zuckerberg dismissed as  crazy  the idea that misinformation, spread via Facebook, could have  influenced the election in any way.  (Then-President Barack Obama reportedly pulled Zuckerberg aside a couple of days after he made the statement and warned he should take the threat of disinformation on the network seriously. About a year after Obama\u2019s warning, Zuckerberg wrote a mea culpa saying he regretted the statement.  This is too important an issue to be dismissive,  he said.) Or the time before that, during the first Democratic primary of 2016, when Roger McNamee, an early Facebook investor, said he warned Zuckerberg and Sandberg that people were being manipulated on the platform \u2015 yet his concerns went unheeded.  They treated it like a public relations problem, rather than a substantive issue for the business,  he said, in a statement that\u2019s just as relevant today as it was then. Facebook has forcefully argued it\u2019s fine policing itself since at least 2011, when the Federal Election Commission first considered regulating political ads on the platform, then backed down after being warned by company lawyers not to  stand in the way of innovation.   Making you angry, making you afraid, is really good for Facebook\u2019s business,  McNamee said previously.  It is not good for America. It\u2019s not good for the users of Facebook.  This post has been updated with Sandberg\u2019s Wednesday statement and more background on Facebook\u2019s history.  "

            "text": "An evangelical Christian pastor who previously confessed to a  sexual incident  with a teenager 20 years ago has admitted that his past conduct was not only  immoral,  but also an  abuse of power.  Tennessee pastor Andy Savage made the remarks in a statement announcing his official resignation from Memphis\u2019 Highpoint Church on Tuesday. Savage had been on a leave of absence from the megachurch since January while an investigation was conducted into his ministry. Jules Woodson, the woman who went public with allegations of sexual abuse against the pastor in early January, had criticized Savage for calling it a  sexual incident.  Highpoint Church also faced backlash after members were seen giving Savage a standing ovation after he read out an apology letter during a church service that month.  When Jules cried out for justice, I carelessly turned the topic to my own story of moral change, as if getting my own life in order should help to make up for what she went through and continues to go through,  Savage wrote in Tuesday\u2019s statement.  I agree with Jules that, of all places, we as the Church should be getting this right.  Woodson says she was abused in 1998 when she was 17 years old, after an event at Woodlands Parkway Baptist Church in Texas, where Savage was serving as a youth pastor. She said the pastor, who was 22 at the time, drove her to a private location and forced her to perform sexual acts. Afterwards, leaders at the Texas church urged Woodson to keep quiet about what had happened to her and promised to address the matter internally. Savage resigned from his position at the church and moved to Memphis, where he was later hired by Highpoint. Highpoint Church said its leadership was aware of Savage\u2019s past with Woodson before hiring him. The Woodlands Parkway church in Texas later changed its name to StoneBridge Church. Larry Cotton, a former pastor at the church, was involved in the initial investigation into Savage\u2019s actions 20 years ago. Cotton resigned from his position at an Austin church in February. Savage wrote that during his recent leave of absence, he\u2019s come to see that  many wrongs occurred  in Woodson\u2019s case \u2015 the first being his  inappropriate relationship,  which he said could not have come from  mutual consent.  Savage wrote that the relationship was  not only immoral, but meets the definition of abuse of power since I was her youth pastor.  He wrote that there was also a  failure to follow due process  and give Woodson the investigation and proper response she deserved.  Admittedly, at 22 and in my first job, I truly believed that I was being guided through proper steps for restitution, which included resigning my position and moving from Houston to Memphis,  Savage wrote.  Those steps seemed significant at the time, and I trusted in the process assigned to me. Only through my recent time of reflection have I realized that more should have been done.  Texas has a law against clergy sexual assault, but the case against Savage is beyond the statute of limitations, according to The New York Times. Savage said he is stepping away from ministry now to  do everything I can to right the wrongs of the past.  Highpoint also announced on Tuesday that an investigation into Savage\u2019s ministry has been completed. Scott Fredricks, a lawyer with the Texas-based firm Cantey Hanger, led the investigation. Fredricks told HuffPost in January that he would study  the church\u2019s actions with respect to Andy Savage\u2019s ministry at Highpoint.   This will include both past and current actions of the church and its leadership concerning his ministry, the impact of those actions, and advising Highpoint as it makes decisions about the future of ministry at Highpoint,  Fredricks wrote in an email. Highpoint reported Tuesday that Fredricks found no other instances of abuse in Savage\u2019s ministry. The investigation\u2019s final findings were communicated to the elders and trustees of the church.   Highpoint leadership has come to recognize that it was defensive rather than empathetic in its initial reaction to Ms. Jules Woodson\u2019s communication concerning the abuse she experienced, and humbly commits to develop a deeper understanding of an appropriate, more compassionate response to victims of abuse,  the church said in a separate statement. The megachurch has also asked MinistrySafe, a Texas-based legal team that seeks to help churches set up sexual abuse prevention protocols, to conduct an audit of the church\u2019s current child safety protocols.

The Weinstein Company filed for bankruptcy in the Delaware court, listing $500 million to $1 billion in liabilities and $500 million to $1 billion in assets, and said it struck a deal with an affiliate of private equity firm Lantern Capital Partners to acquire its assets.  The bankruptcy comes after the studio spent months looking for a buyer or investor. The company inked a deal with an investor group led by former Obama administration official Maria Contreras-Sweet, but the group terminated its offer earlier this month after seeing that the company had more liabilities than previously disclosed. The Weinstein Company said in a statement it entered into a  stalking horse  agreement with a Lantern Capital affiliate, that would purchase substantially all of the assets of the company. The offer from Lantern will set the floor for higher and better bidders in a court-supervised auction. Lions Gate Entertainment Corp had made an earlier offer for some of the company\u2019s assets, as had Qatar-owned film company Miramax, which was founded by Harvey Weinstein and his brother Bob Weinstein. Both could be among potential bidders in the auction. More than 70 women accused the company\u2019s co-founder, Harvey Weinstein, who was one of Hollywood\u2019s most influential men, of sexual misconduct, including rape. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.  Since October, it has been reported that Harvey Weinstein used non-disclosure agreements as a secret weapon to silence his accusers. Effective immediately, those \u2018agreements\u2019 end,  the company said in an emailed statement. Movie producer Killer Content also said bankruptcy would be the best option for the company, and that it may be interested in the studio\u2019s assets in a bankruptcy auction. In February, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sued The Weinstein Company, Harvey Weinstein and his brother Bob Weinstein, alleging that Harvey Weinstein sexually harassed employees and the company failed to respond. Bob Weinstein co-founded the company and is the co-chairman.  This is a watershed moment for efforts to address the corrosive effects of sexual misconduct in the workplace,  Schneiderman said in a statement after the company\u2019s announcement on Monday. Launched in October 2005, the studio produced and distributed critically acclaimed hits including  The King\u2019s Speech  and  Silver Linings Playbook,  as well as TV series such as long-running fashion reality competition  Project Runway.

A lot of video vixens have spoke about this and nobody gives a fuck,  she said, referring to harassment faced by women who star in music videos.

            "text": "In the wake of the Me Too reckoning, many have assumed that older and younger women \u2015 second- and third-wave feminists \u2015 have different perspectives on the anti-sexual-violence movement. The older generation allegedly believe younger women need to be less sensitive and essentially buck up, while younger women think older women are out of touch with what constitutes sexual assault and harassment.  A new survey from Vox Media in partnership with Morning Consult, however, disproves this theory by a long shot.   The results of our survey contradict the idea that there\u2019s a war raging over #MeToo between generations of American women,  Vox\u2019s Anna North wrote.  Instead, we found a lot of similarities across the age divide when it came to what women think about #MeToo \u2015 and what too many of them still experience in the workplace.  According to the report, published on Tuesday, a majority of women of all ages support the Me Too reckoning and believe the movement fairly represents their interests. Seventy-one percent of women 34 and under and 68 percent of women 35 and older responded that they support the movement. Only 8 percent of women under 35 opposed Me Too, while a slightly larger percentage (14 percent) of women over 35 also opposed it. The poll was conducted from March 2-8 of this year, and sampled 2,511 women over the age of 18. The survey was conducted online and centered around cis gender people.  Researchers explained why they divided women by this age range:  We chose to compare women ages 18 to 34 with women 35 and over because much media conversation around #MeToo and generational divides focused on millennials. Definitions of \u2018millennial\u2019 vary, but most put the oldest members of the generation in their mid-30s today.  The survey found that younger women were more concerned about the negative outcomes of Me Too than older women. Thirty-one percent of women under 35 said they were  very  concerned about the Me Too movement causing men to deny women professional opportunities, while only 23 percent of women over 35 agreed. The margin was smaller between younger and older women when asked if they were worried about men being denied due process: 22 percent of younger women and 23 percent of older women said they were  very  concerned about this issue.  Vox and Morning Consult also found another surprising fact: Older and younger women experience similar rates of sexual harassment despite decades of discussions about gender equality in the workplace. Twenty-nine percent of younger women and 33 percent of older women responded that they have experienced sexual harassment at work, although older women are less likely to report the harassment.

            "text": "Hundreds of women joined together in Poland on Sunday to voice their frustration with a campaign by Roman Catholic bishops to further restrict abortion access in the country. The abortion rights activists were speaking out against a decision by the Polish bishops\u2019 conference to support a bill that would ban abortion in cases where the fetus had a congenital disorder or deformity.  About 400 people demonstrated outside the Catholic archbishop\u2019s headquarters in Warsaw, according to The Associated Press. Another group protested in front of an archdiocese building in Krakow. The protesters carried wire hangers to symbolize the dangers facing women driven to obtain illegal abortions by Poland\u2019s already stringent laws. The anti-abortion bill began as a citizens\u2019 initiative pushed by conservative groups. On Monday, it won the support of a parliamentary committee on human rights, which means it will be studied by a second committee before potentially being submitted for a vote in Poland\u2019s parliament, according to Agence France Presse.  If the measure passes these remaining hurdles, Polish President Andrzej Duda has pledged to sign the bill into law, AFP reports. But according to the Federation for Women and Family Planning, a Polish reproductive rights group, the measure had been languishing in a  legislative freezer  \u2015 until the Catholic bishops intervened.   This illustrates the enormous power of the Church and the strong resistance of the politicians to put human rights over their own interests in the light of the upcoming elections in 2018 (local) and 2019 (national),  the federation said in a statement. Poland already has some of the most stringent anti-abortion laws in Europe. The staunchly Catholic country made abortion illegal, with a few exceptions, in 1993. The move was strongly supported by Polish Catholic church leaders. Then-Pope John Paul II campaigned in his home country in favor of the bill. Today, women in Poland are allowed to obtain abortions only if the mother\u2019s life is at risk, there\u2019s a fetal abnormality, or the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. Women can have a hard time finding doctors who will perform abortions even when they fall under those exceptions, according to Time. As a result, some women travel to nearby countries like Germany to have the procedure done or seek abortions from underground providers in Poland. Others order pills for abortions online. According to Poland\u2019s official statistics, about 1,000 legal abortions occur there every year. (The country has a population of roughly 38 million.) Abortion rights activists say the number of illegal abortions could be more than 10 times higher. An estimated 95 percent of legal abortions in Poland are obtained because of fetal abnormalities, The Guardian reports. Polish women have been voicing opposition to their country\u2019s restrictive abortion laws in recent years. In 2016, thousands of women went on strike across the country to protest a draft law that sought to enact a total ban on abortion. About 30,000 people gathered in a central Warsaw square to demonstrate against the legislation. It was ultimately rejected. "

Navratilova said in a BBC Panorama documentary to air Monday that McEnroe earned at least 10 times more than she did for BBC coverage of the Grand Slam tournament.  It\u2019s hard to really compare exactly because some people work a little longer days, maybe a few more programs or whatever,  Navratilova said in a preview clip of  Britain\u2019s Equal Pay Scandal,  posted by BBC Panorama (watch above).  But overall, it was a shock because John McEnroe makes at least 150,000 pounds. I get about 15,000 pounds for Wimbledon. And unless John McEnroe\u2019s doing a whole bunch of stuff outside of Wimbledon, he\u2019s getting at least 10 times as much money than I am for very comparable work.  Navratilova made about 10 appearances compared with 30 for McEnroe during Wimbledon, BBC Panorama estimated, per the Telegraph. BBC Sport told the Guardian that McEnroe\u2019s participation was of  a different scale, scope and time commitment.   Along with Sue Barker, John is regarded as the face of our Wimbledon coverage,  a spokeswoman said.  He is a defining voice within the BBC\u2019s coverage. He is widely considered to be the best expert/commentator in the sport, highly valued by our audiences and his contract means he cannot work for another UK broadcaster without our permission. His pay reflects all of this \u2013 gender isn\u2019t a factor.  McEnroe\u2019s earnings came to light last year when the BBC published a list of its highest-paid personalities, putting his pay between \u00a3150,000 and \u00a3199,999 ($210,560 to $280,740), HuffPost UK reported. The tennis championships last about two weeks. When told that the BBC may use McEnroe\u2019s greater hours as a defense, Navratilova said the disparity still didn\u2019t add up. She said she was told that she and McEnroe were making a comparable wage.  It makes me angry for the other women that I think go through this,  she said. Reps for McEnroe didn\u2019t immediately respond to a HuffPost request for comment. "

Strampel, the longtime boss of convicted pedophile Larry Nassar and former dean of Michigan State University\u2019s College of Osteopathic Medicine, said in 2016 that he didn\u2019t believe the athletes who accused Nassar of sexual abuse, The Wall Street Journal reports. Strampel supervised Nassar for almost 15 years during Nassar\u2019s tenure as MSU\u2019s team doctor, during which time Nassar sexually abused hundreds of athletes. He stepped down as dean in 2017 due to medical reasons and amid backlash that he had ignored complaints about Nassar. Strampel is still an MSU employee and is named as a defendant in several civil lawsuits against MSU. The Wall Street Journal recently obtained notes from an October 2016 meeting with four students and three MSU administrators about a separate incident of sexual assault between a female and male student. According to the notes, Strampel brushed off the female student\u2019s accusation and pointed to Nassar as an example of how people often lie about abuse:  This just goes to show that none of you learned the most basic lesson in medicine, medicine 101, that you should have learned in your first week: don\u2019t trust your patients,  Dr. Strampel is quoted saying.  Patients lie to get doctors in trouble. And we\u2019re seeing that right now in the news with this Nassar stuff. I don\u2019t think any of these women were actually assaulted by Larry, but Larry didn\u2019t learn that lesson and didn\u2019t have a chaperone in the room, so now they see an opening and they can take advantage of him.  One of the people at the meeting told the news outlet that everyone in the meeting was shocked by Strampel\u2019s comments.  He can\u2019t possibly be serious,  the person said.  Read more at The Wall Street Journal.  Nassar was fired from MSU over allegations of sexual abuse in September 2016, only a few weeks before this meeting. He was arrested in November of the same year on child pornography charges.  A spokeswoman for MSU told HuffPost that the university will not speak on behalf of Strampel, but pointed out that MSU\u2019s interim President John Engler did begin the process of terminating Strampel\u2019s employment in February.    William Strampel did not act with the level of professionalism we expect from individuals who hold senior leadership positions, particularly in a position that involves student and patient safety,  Engler said at the time.  We are sending an unmistakable message today that we will remove employees who do not treat students, faculty, staff or anyone else in our community in an appropriate manner.  The termination process for Strampel could take up to a year.  MSU\u2019s College of Osteopathic Medicine did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. Strampel could not be reached for comment.  MSU and its administration have been put on blast for how the university failed to protect its students. According to an explosive report from The Detroit News, at least 14 MSU staffers and representatives were told of Nassar\u2019s abuse but did nothing to stop it.  According to court records, Nassar abused at least 265 children and young athletes during his time at MSU and as the USA Gymnastics team doctor. Last year, Nassar was sentenced to 60 years in prison on child pornography charges. He was recently sentenced to two separate sentences of up to 175 years on child sexual abuse.

            "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Forty-five U.S. trade associations representing some of the largest companies in the country are urging President Donald Trump not to impose tariffs on China, warning it would be  particularly harmful  to the U.S. economy and consumers. The organizations said in a letter sent to Trump on Sunday that potential tariffs on China would raise prices on consumer goods, kill jobs and drive down financial markets. The letter marks the latest in a growing rift between Trump and the business community on trade policies, as the president has begun to take more aggressive steps he says are needed to protect domestic industry.  We urge the administration not to impose tariffs and to work with the business community to find an effective, but measured, solution to China\u2019s protectionist trade policies and practices that protects American jobs and competitiveness,  the groups wrote.  Tariffs would be particularly harmful,  they said. The groups called on Trump to work with trade allies to push for changes to China\u2019s policies. The business groups said while they had serious concerns about China\u2019s approach to trade, unilateral tariffs by the United States would only separate the country from allies, and encourage them to replace the U.S. business presence in China when Beijing retaliates. Trade associations publicly pushing back include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Retail Federation and the Information Technology Industry Council. The Trump administration is said to be preparing tariffs against Chinese information technology, telecoms and consumer products in an attempt to force changes in Beijing\u2019s intellectual property and investment practices. The Republican president recently announced plans to impose tariffs on certain steel and aluminum imports, despite opposition from some business sectors. The groups also called on Trump to allow industry experts to comment on the economic impact of any changes in trade policy before the measures take effect.  We urge the administration to take measured, commercially meaningful actions consistent with international obligations that benefit U.S. exporters, importers, and investors, rather than penalize the American consumer and jeopardize recent gains in American competitiveness,  they said.

So jewelry fans and ear-piercing enthusiasts, fear not! Claire\u2019s plans to continue its store operations per usual throughout the Chapter 11 process.

            "text": "Two Muslim women who were arrested in New York City last year claim that police officers forced them to remove their hijabs to pose for mugshots despite the women\u2019s tearful objections that doing so would deeply violate their faith.   Lawyers for Jamilla Clark and Arwa Aziz filed a federal class-action lawsuit against the city on Friday, seeking unspecified damages and a change to current city policy that requires head coverings to be removed for the police department\u2019s official photo \u2015 even those coverings, like headscarves, that do not obscure a person\u2019s face.  No New Yorker should be robbed of their right to practice their faith simply because they are arrested,  Albert Fox Cahn, a lawyer representing the women, told HuffPost.  We want city-wide reform because too many New Yorkers have already suffered under our existing policy, forced to undress against their will.  Cahn, who is the legal director for the New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, contends that the New York Police Department\u2019s policy violates people\u2019s right to religious freedom under the First Amendment and federal law. He said the lawsuit seeks to protect any New Yorker who wears religious head coverings that leave the face visible, including hijabs, yarmulkes, turbans and wigs.   Requiring a Muslim woman to remove her hijab in public is akin to demanding that a secular person strip naked in front of strangers,  the lawsuit argues. Currently, the NYPD\u2019s patrol guide provides that arrestees who refuse to remove their religious head coverings for their official photo should be transported to police headquarters in Manhattan. There, the arrestee can have the picture taken in private by an officer of the same gender.  The New York City Law Department said in a statement to The Associated Press that it\u2019s confident the current policy  passes constitutional muster.   It carefully balances the department\u2019s respect for the customs of all religions with the legitimate law enforcement need to take arrest photos,  the law office said.  Persons who do not wish to remove religious head coverings in front of others have the option of being taken to a separate, more private facility to be photographed.  Clark, a Muslim woman from Cedar Grove, New Jersey, was arrested on Jan. 9, 2017, at Manhattan Family Court for violating a protective order. The lawsuit claims Clark\u2019s abusive former husband had fabricated the charges underlying that order. The charges were later dismissed by prosecutors, The New York Times reports. According to the lawsuit, police officers ordered Clark to remove her hijab to pose for a booking photo. She told them that her religious beliefs barred her from removing her hijab in front of men who did not belong to her immediate family. Police then allegedly informed her that she would be prosecuted if she declined, and one officer made  numerous hostile comments about Muslims,  the lawsuit claims. After being taken to NYPD headquarters, Clark agreed to remove her hijab so that a female officer could take her photo in a private room. But Clark contends that the female officer subsequently showed the photo to approximately five male colleagues.  When they forced me to take off my hijab, I felt as if I were naked. I\u2019m not sure if words can capture how exposed and violated I felt,  Clark said in a CAIR press release. Her lawyers claim that the NYPD maintains at least one photograph of Clark without her hijab in its database.   The existence of this photograph haunts Ms. Clark, who is distressed by the prospect of the photograph being viewed again and again by men who are not members of her immediate family,  the lawsuit says. Aziz, a woman from Brooklyn, New York, contends that she had a similarly distressing experience with New York police. She was arrested on Aug. 30, 2017, for violating a protective order filed  on false pretenses  by a sister-in-law, her lawyers allege. Those charges would also later be dismissed by prosecutors. Officers at Brooklyn Central Booking demanded that Aziz remove her hijab for a photo, according to the lawsuit. She refused, explaining that she wore the hijab for religious reasons. She said she offered to pull the headscarf back slightly to reveal her bangs and hairline, but the officers continued to demand that she remove it entirely. Although they also said she could be transported to NYPD headquarters to take the picture, they allegedly claimed that there was no guarantee a female photographer would be present and that the move would force police to  restart  the entire booking process. Aziz finally agreed to pull the hijab down to her neck. The lawsuit alleges she  wept throughout the entire ordeal  and continues to experience  distress and humiliation  when she thinks about how those pictures may still appear in the NYPD\u2019s database. Turning Point for Women and Families, a Queens-based advocacy group for Muslim survivors of domestic violence, is also listed as a plaintiff in the lawsuit. Its executive director, Robina Niaz, said that fear of police officers can discourage her group\u2019s clients from coming forward with allegations of abuse.  I fear this policy [on head coverings] makes it harder for victims of domestic violence that we serve to report their abusers to the police,  Niaz said in the CAIR press release. The lawsuit seeks to prohibit the NYPD from requiring the removal of  any religious head or hair covering  for the purpose of post-arrest photographs. Cahn declined to comment on how he feels the police department should handle booking photos for Muslim women who wear the niqab or burqa, two types of Islamic garments that cover the face. He said this lawsuit focuses exclusively on the rights of detainees whose religious head coverings leave their faces uncovered. The suit points out that other federal and state entities have policies allowing Muslim women to remain covered in official photos. The U.S. State Department allows religious head coverings in official passport photos. New York\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles permits women to keep their hijabs on while taking driver\u2019s license photos. Police departments in Michigan, Minnesota and elsewhere also permit religious accommodations in booking photographs.  Being forced to publicly remove the hijab, the lawsuit contends,  is a profound defilement of the wearer\u2019s sincerely-held religious beliefs and a violation of her religious practice.  "

Houston had other ideas Saturday in a second-round NCAA matchup, seemingly having the game in hand with senior forward Devin Davis securing a rebound and picking up a foul with 3.9 seconds left and the Cougars holding a 63-61 lead. But Davis missed both of his free throws, setting up freshman Jordan Poole and the Wolverines for a moment they will never forget. Poole\u2019s desperation 3-pointer at the buzzer on a pass from senior guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman secured a 64-63 Michigan win and a date next weekend in the Sweet 16. Poole told reporters that he didn\u2019t even know the shot went in until he saw the reaction from the Michigan bench.  We work on that play thousands of times in practice,  Poole said.  We executed it perfectly, especially from the inbounds pass, getting it to our senior guard Muhammad. Ham could have put the shot up easily, but he had the confidence to find me, and I just knocked the shot down.  I think the guys on the team know that I never lose confidence. You\u2019ve just got to always be ready for the opportunity and for the moment.  Poole, a streaky shooter and spot rotation player hitting 37.8 percent of his 3-pointers, entered the game on a cold run, having scored just 16 points in the Wolverines\u2019 previous five games. In contrast, he hit five 3-pointers against Indiana on Dec. 2.  He obviously found his stroke at the right time. He finished the game with eight points on 3-of-5 shooting from the field in 11 minutes off the bench.  We had him in the scout team earlier in the year because he was still growing and was not a guy that was in our top nine,  Michigan coach Jim Beilein said of Poole after the game.  And the shot clock would get down and, you know, the first team\u2019s all excited they\u2019re going to get a stop, and he\u2019d put in a buzzer shot.  Davis, meanwhile, was great at the line throughout the game but missed three of his last four free throws as he finished 9-of-12 from the stripe. It was a stunning finish that demonstrated the immense joy and devastating heartbreak the NCAA tournament is known for. The game was tight throughout as both teams struggled to score and traded the lead 17 times. Houston shot 37 percent from the field while Michigan managed to hit 35.6 percent of its field goals. Junior forward Mortiz Wagner did most of the damage for Michigan with 12 points, seven rebounds and three assists while Abdur-Rahkman also logged 12 points. Charles Matthews and Duncan Robinson were the only other Wolverines in double figures with 11 points each. Rob Gray, Houston\u2019s leading scorer, filled up the box score with 23 points and 10 rebounds, but needed 22 shots to get there. Davis put in a productive 35 minutes, logging 17 points and seven rebounds that will be of little solace after he missed those final free throws. Michigan will move on to face the winner of Sunday\u2019s matchup between North Carolina and Texas A&M. The Wolverines will depend on the stifling defense that led them to the Big Ten tournament title and through the first weekend of the NCAA tournament, but will likely need more from their offense to advance to the next round. But Saturday\u2019s not a night for Michigan to contemplate what\u2019s next. It\u2019s a night for celebration.

            "text": "The world desperately needs more women leaders, but feminists don\u2019t have to love and champion each and every woman who lands in a position of power. This week, Pres. Donald Trump nominated Gina Haspel to run the Central Intelligence Agency. If the Senate confirms her, she will be the first woman to run the CIA in its 70-year history. A female groundbreaker is something to celebrate, right?  But Haspel, a veteran CIA operative who\u2019s been with the agency for more than 30 years, comes with controversy. During the Bush years, after the attacks of Sept. 11, Haspel ran a  black site  prison in Thailand that conducted so-called enhanced interrogation \u2015  torture \u2015 that\u2019s since been exposed, called out and halted. There are also charges that she participated in covering up some of these activities. Many civil rights advocates have already decried her nomination. And because of the secretive nature of the CIA, the extent of her involvement remains murky.  Pres. Trump made sure to brag that Haspel was the first woman chosen to lead the CIA, and some of his staff amplified the point. But considering Haspel\u2019s dark past, it\u2019s not at all clear that her elevation would be anything like a win for women.  Feminism isn\u2019t about wildly agreeing with all women,  Michelle Ryan, a psychology professor at the University of Exeter in England who studies gender and leadership.  It\u2019s about equality.  Typically, the idea that women each be judged on their individual merits is an argument that conservative women make without much fuss. From the right, this view lines up with a belief in the ascendance of individuality. The argument was endlessly rehashed during the presidential election when women on both sides of the aisle proclaimed that they didn\u2019t have to support Hillary Clinton just because she was a woman.   Women are individuals and can think for themselves and ought to,  said Mona Charen, a senior fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center.  It\u2019ll be a great day when people react to a woman based on her individual qualities.   The issue of whether or not to celebrate a pioneering woman regardless of her policies isn\u2019t complicated for Charen. A longtime conservative, who chose not to work for George H.W. Bush because he was too much of a  squish,  she doesn\u2019t necessarily think it matters that there are so few women leaders in politics or business.   Women should do what they want to do,  said Charen, who has a book coming out this summer called Sex Matters: How Modern Feminism Lost Touch With Science, Love and Common Sense.  If they want to be leaders, they should be,  she said. If not, that\u2019s OK, too. Charen, who made a name for herself recently by speaking her mind about Republican hypocrisy at a conservative gathering, noted that Haspel has a strong reputation for competence and is fairly widely respected. (A rarity considering the caliber of those in the Trump orbit these days.) Charen\u2019s been making the case for women to be judged individually throughout her career with little controversy.  However, when progressives, who are typically more focused on women\u2019s rights, don\u2019t automatically celebrate every woman leader, there is more backlash. It really confuses some conservatives when progressive feminist women don\u2019t automatically support every big-name female leader. But that reveals a naked misunderstanding or indifference to women\u2019s rights \u2015 a presumption that all us girls need is to see a woman in power and the feminist project ends there. You need only look back to the uproar around Sarah Palin in 2008 to see the same issues crop up. Republicans tried to gin up enthusiasm for Palin, simply because she was a woman \u2015 a way to draw votes from frustrated women who had supported Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed bid for the Democratic nomination. They didn\u2019t seem to realize that those women cared about actual policies and ideas, too. It\u2019s not enough that a candidate wear a skirt; she must also espouse policies and ideas that empower the people who wear skirts. Palin did not.  The McCain campaign is cynically trying to recreate the excitement that surrounded Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy,  wrote Jessica Valenti in The Guardian at the time.  Believing that all women want is ... another woman.  Kellyanne Conway was the first female presidential campaign manager to win an election. Fox News a while back tried to argue that feminists should therefore love her. Feminists, under this rationale, are also supposed to applaud Sarah Huckabee Sanders for simply being a working mother with a high-profile role. But it\u2019s tough to get psyched about the women in Trump\u2019s orbit. They not only support and enable a man accused multiple times of sexual assault, but who is also openly hostile to policies and positions that would help women. There are a few wrinkles here that probably help add to the confusion on the right.  First, in a collective sense we do want to simply see more women in power. Gender equality \u2015 generally \u2015 leads to more fair outcomes for women. Research has shown that the empowerment of more women can lead to more opportunities for women \u2015 new kinds of jobs, pathways to promotion, etc. More women leaders mean that more girls get female role models to look up to and emulate. You have to see it to be it, the argument goes. More women in power also can lead to a reduction in gender discrimination and an increase in pro-women policies, too. We saw this in the fight to keep Obamacare, a policy with huge benefits for women, in place last year \u2015 it was female Republican senators who kept health care alive. There\u2019s even some research that shows that more women in power leads to a reduction in sexual harassment. It is female senators \u2015 on both sides \u2015 who are pushing for paid leave laws right now. Second, feminists are typically inclined to call out sexism, no matter the target. That means they\u2019ve objected to the misogynistic portrayals of Conway, Sanders and Palin \u2014 even while disagreeing with their policies and positions. It\u2019ll be interesting to see if Haspel faces a sexist, gendered critique in the coming weeks. She\u2019s expected to face tough questioning over her role in the CIA torture program at her confirmation hearing, which is set for April. She\u2019s already been called  the queen of torture.  Because there are so few women at the top of organizations, the ones who do ascend are judged not just on their merits \u2015 but through the lens of their gender.  When a female leader fails, that\u2019s almost always a ding for all women, said Ryan, who is one of the researchers who coined the term  Glass Cliff,  after finding that women were more likely to be thrust into leadership positions at organizations that were already imperiled. It\u2019s possible Haspel\u2019s involvement in the CIA\u2019s program will be judged more harshly because women are often expected to somehow be more moral, empathetic and caring than men:  We don\u2019t expect women to be involved in torturing people,  Ryan said. Would a man be called out in the same way facing the same charges, she asked. (It recalls the way Lynndie England became the face of the horrifying story of torture in Iraq, even as there were so many others involved and making the decisions that enabled her.) Not everyone is that worried about sexism and Haspel. Now that she\u2019s shattered the glass ceiling, Haspel should be judged on her merits, said Juliette Kayyem, former assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security and a lecturer at the Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government.   There\u2019s not a female approach to homeland security,  said Kayyem, who worked under Janet Napolitano during the Obama administration.  Interestingly, Kayyem also pointed out that it\u2019s actually been easier for women to reach the top in national security \u2015 Kirstjen M. Nielsen runs DHS currently \u2015 than break through at an operational level.  Rank and file agents and officers are still more likely to be men at the CIA, Kayyem said:  It\u2019s not uncommon to be in a room where senior leadership is more diverse than the agents and investigators.  We can applaud Haspel for being the first, Kayyem said.  But we need to know why we\u2019re applauding it. She is a woman who ought to now be judged as we would want a man to be judged.  Or, in other words, she should be judged as we would want any human to be. That\u2019s equality. "

The photo is accompanied by the hashtags #dropthecover and #normalizebreastfeeding. The movement to normalize breastfeeding has been happening to various extents for decades. Celebrities like Pink, Maya Rudolph, Olivia Wilde and many more have taken to social media to share their experiences with their children in an effort to remove the stigma associated with the act.

            "text": "Rihanna is outraged by an ad on Snapchat that downplayed abuse by referencing Chris Brown\u2019s 2009 conviction for assaulting her while they were dating. The ad, which is for a game called  Would You Rather,  asks users if they would rather  slap Rihanna  or  punch Chris Brown.  The social media platform told BBC News that it published the ad  in error  and removed it last weekend, as soon as it was made aware of its mistake. Snapchat has a review process for ads that states it will not publish ads that feature  shocking, sensational, or disrespectful content.   We are sorry that this happened,  Snapchat said. Rihanna, however, isn\u2019t accepting the apology. The singer posted an Instagram story Thursday that said  Throw the whole app-oligy away  in response to Snapchat.  I\u2019d love to call it ignorance, but I know you ain\u2019t that dumb!  she wrote.  You spent money to animate something that would intentionally bring shame to DV victims and made a joke of it!!! This isn\u2019t about my personal feelings, cause I don\u2019t have much of them \u2026 but all the women, children and men that have been victims of DV in the past and especially the ones who haven\u2019t made it out yet \u2026 you let us down!  Her statement was shared on Twitter by Gennette Cordova: After Rihanna called the company out, Snapchat apologized again, saying the ad was  disgusting.  The insensitive ad came to the public\u2019s attention on Monday when Twitter user Royce Mann screenshot and posted it to the social media platform. It didn\u2019t take long for other users to express their outrage \u2015 including activists Brittany Packnett and Chelsea Clinton. Following Rihanna\u2019s response, shares for Snap Inc., Snapchat\u2019s parent company, dropped nearly 5 percent, Bloomberg reported. The  Wild Thoughts  singer isn\u2019t the only celebrity whose star power has influenced the company\u2019s value.

            "text": "Critics don\u2019t hesitate to point out that country music is a male-dominated industry. In fact, some data suggests that with the recent popularity of  bro country  \u2014 think Luke Bryan or Blake Shelton \u2014 the problem has gotten worse. Women artists notoriously don\u2019t get as much airtime on country radio stations as their male counterparts. If you look at the current Billboard Country Airplay chart, every artist in the top 20 is a male singer or group of men \u2015 with the sole exception of pop singer Bebe Rexha, who collaborated with Florida Georgia Line on  Meant to Be.  Women of color face even more challenges in country music. Their historical contributions to the genre have been erased, and the contemporary mainstream scene is seriously lacking in diversity. In recent years, many women in country music have lamented their underrepresentation on the radio and at live music events.   You would think that we would be farther along in the thinking about women in country music,  Carrie Underwood told Billboard in 2014.  There is certainly not a shortage of talented ladies out there that want so badly to get their fair shot in this business. But there seems to be only room for only a few.  During a candid discussion with other female artists about sexism in country music in 2016, Margot Price said she\u2019s often the only woman on the bill at country shows and notices that many labels seem hesitant to take on female musicians.  Follow Your Arrow  singer Kacey Musgraves said women are held to different standards than men when it comes to radio play.  If they can\u2019t get your song off the ground, it\u2019s immediately blamed on your personality, or the fact that you\u2019re female, or that you didn\u2019t make a radio station program director feel important,  she noted.  In addition to speaking out, many female country artists over the years have recorded songs that tackle gender equality and women\u2019s issues. In honor of Women\u2019s History Month, we\u2019ve put together a list of country songs that feature feminist messages.    Maddie & Tae\u2019s 2014 debut single quickly became known as  the feminist country song.  The Billboard Country Airplay chart-topper was a response to troubling trends in contemporary country music \u2014 namely the rampant objectification of women in songs and music videos from male artists. Notable lyric:  Like all we\u2019re good for is looking good for you and your friends on the weekend, nothing more.  In January 2018, 23 members of Song Suffragettes \u2015 a Nashville songwriting coalition for women \u2015 contributed vocals on  Time\u2019s Up,  an empowering song recorded in support of the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund to combat sexual misconduct in the workplace. The group is vocal about women\u2019s issues, even creating the hashtag #LetTheGirlsPlay to bring attention to the shortage of airtime and live performance spots for female country singers. Notable lyric:  They say good things come to those who wait. But we\u2019ve waited long enough. Our time is here. Our time is now. Our time has come. And your time is up.  Released in March 2014, Kira Isabella\u2019s  Quarterback  is one of the first mainstream country songs to tackle the topic of rape culture. The lyrics tell the story of a high school girl in the marching band who survives sexual assault at the hands of the hometown hero football star. Even after degrading photos of her appear on Internet, the town sides with the eponymous quarterback. Notable lyric:  Who you gonna blame, the star of the game or the no name girl in the freshman class?  In 1968, Dolly Parton addressed the sexist double standards women face with the title track off her second solo album.  Just Because I\u2019m A Woman  was an anti-slut-shaming anthem before the phrase took hold in mainstream media. Notable lyric:  Yes I\u2019ve made my mistakes, but listen and understand, my mistakes are no worse than yours just because I\u2019m a woman.  A country-fied cover of an early track from singer-songwriter Patty Griffin, the Wreckers\u2019  One More Girl  (2006) is a frank song about the objectification of women. Michelle Branch and Jessica Harp sing about being reduced to sexual objects, as  one more girl on a stage, just one more ass that got stuffed in some jeans.  Notable lyric:  Did you ever take the time to think about who I might be? Where I\u2019ve been, what I\u2019m thinking, who I love, what I\u2019ve seen? ... I\u2019m one more car out on the road that you might pass on your way home. I\u2019m someone\u2019s sister or someone\u2019s wife or just some bitch who\u2019s probably got no life.   What Part of No  speaks from the perspective of a woman at a bar who is fed up with the man persistently hitting on her. The 1992 song is an anthem of female agency in the face of harassment.  Notable lyric:  Sir if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d rather be alone, from the moment I walked in tonight; you\u2018ve been coming on. If I told you once, I told you twice, I\u2019m just here to unwind. I\u2019m not interested in romance, or what you have in mind. What part of no don\u2019t you understand?  The meaning of Loretta Lynn\u2019s controversial 1975 song,  The Pill,  is pretty straightforward. It\u2019s a celebration from the perspective of a woman who just gained freedom and control over her reproductive health through access to birth control. Notable lyric:  I\u2019m turning down your brooder house cause now I\u2019ve got the pill. All these years I\u2019ve stayed at home while you had all your fun and every year that\u2019s gone by, another baby\u2019s come. There\u2019s gonna be some changes made right here on nursery hill. You set this chicken your last time cause now I\u2019ve got the pill.  Kacey Musgraves\u2019 2013 song calls out the double standards women face ( you\u2019re damned if you do and you\u2019re damned if you don\u2019t ) and empowers listeners to be true to themselves. The chorus is also explicitly non-heteronormative with its  kiss lots of boys or kiss lots of girls if that\u2019s something you\u2019re into  line.  Notable lyric:  If you save yourself for marriage, you\u2019re a bore. If you don\u2019t save yourself for marriage, you\u2019re a whore ... able person. If you won\u2019t have a drink, then you\u2019re a prude. But they\u2019ll call you a drunk as soon as you down the first one.  This narrative song, which has ben covered by Martina McBride, tells the story of a widow and mom who stands up for herself after being slut-shamed for the way she dresses and raises her teenage daughter. In a PTA meeting, she calls out the parents who shamed her by highlighting their various examples of misconduct and utter hypocrisy. Notable lyric:  Mrs. Johnson, you\u2019re wearing your dresses way too high. It\u2019s reported you\u2019ve been drinkin\u2019 and runnin\u2019 round with men and goin\u2019 wild. And we don\u2019t believe you oughta be a bringin\u2019 up your little girl this way.   Mindy McCready\u2019s 1996 song addresses the double standards for men and women when it comes to bad behavior. The narrator of the song complains about being chastised for staying out late and getting drunk with her girlfriends, while many men do the same thing all the time without shame.  Mary Chapin Carpenter\u2019s  He Thinks He\u2019ll Keep Her  tells the story of a woman who gains the strength to walk away from an unhappy marriage after 15 years of dutiful work as a housewife and mother \u2015 juxtaposed against the perspective of a husband who  thinks he\u2019ll keep  his wife because she does everything right. After leaving her husband (and her 15-year job with  not one raise in pay ), the wife can only find a minimum-wage job in the working world. The 1993 song was reportedly inspired by the tagline of 1970s ads for Geritol.  This song by bluegrass singer-songwriter Hazel Dickens is another one that calls for men to understand the way their mistreatment of women and complicity in oppression creates certain female archetypes. Notable lyric:  You abuse her, accuse her, turn her round and use her. Then forsake her any time it suits you. There\u2019s more to her than powder and paint, than her peroxided bleached-out hair. And if she acts that way it\u2019s \u2019cause you\u2019ve had your day. Don\u2019t put her down, you helped put her there.  Mickey Guyton\u2019s 2015 debut single,  Better Than You Left Me,  is about her growth and renewed strength as a woman after a breakup. It also propelled Guyton, one of the relatively small number of black women country artists, to the Billboard Country Airplay Top 40.  After being shunned by the country music industry for their lead singer\u2019s criticism of President George W. Bush and the Iraq War, The Dixie Chicks fought back with  Not Ready to Make Nice.  The 2006 anthem of resistance was in many ways ahead of its time, forging the path for artists and celebrities to use their platforms to speak out on issues that matter to them.  Notable lyric:  And how in the world can the words that I said send somebody so over the edge that they\u2019d write me a letter saying that I better \u2018Shut up and sing\u2019 or my life will be over! ... I\u2019m not ready to make nice. I\u2019m not ready to back down. I\u2019m still mad as hell and I don\u2019t have time to go round and round and round.  Kalie Shorr\u2019s  Fight Like a Girl  was a response to #SaladGate \u2015 a 2015 incident when a country radio consultant said women artists shouldn\u2019t get a lot of airplay because they\u2019re the  tomatoes of our salad  while men are  the lettuce.  Shorr\u2019s song is about female empowerment and grit in the face of adversity.  Notable lyric:  I\u2019m perfume sweet and whiskey strong. I damn sure ain\u2019t no underdog. I might fall down but I get back up. I shine brightest when the going\u2019s tough. You say I can\u2019t \u2015 well, darling, watch me. You can\u2019t stop me \u2019cause I fight like a girl.  Martina McBride\u2019s  A Broken Wing  (1997) tells the story of a woman escaping an emotionally abusive relationship and finding her strength to  fly ... with a broken wing.  Notable lyric:  With a broken wing. She carries her dreams. Man you oughta see her fly.  The theme song to her show  Reba,  McEntire\u2019s  I\u2019m a Survivor  celebrates women\u2019s might. The 2001 song focuses on a premature baby girl and a hardworking single mom and their roles as  fighters  and  survivors.  Notable lyric:  A single mom who works two jobs. Who loves her kids and never stops. With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter. I\u2019m a survivor.

            "text": "(Reuters) - IHeartMedia Inc filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Thursday as the largest U.S. radio station owner reached an in-principle agreement with creditors to restructure its overwhelming debt load. The company, which filed for bankruptcy along with some of its units, said it \u200dreached the agreement with holders of more than $10 billion of its outstanding debt for a balance sheet restructuring, which would reduce its debt by more than $10 billion. IHeartMedia, which has struggled with $20 billion of debt and falling revenue at its 858 radio stations, said cash on hand and cash generated from ongoing operations will be sufficient to fund the business during the bankruptcy process.  The agreement ... is a significant accomplishment, as it allows us to definitively address the more than $20 billion in debt that has burdened our capital structure,  Chief Executive Bob Pittman said. The filing comes after John Malone\u2019s Liberty Media Corp proposed on Feb. 26 a deal to buy a 40 percent stake in a restructured iHeartMedia for $1.16 billion, uniting the company with Liberty\u2019s Sirius XM Holdings Inc satellite radio service. Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc, a subsidiary of iHeartMedia and one of the world\u2019s largest billboard companies, and its units did not commence Chapter 11 proceedings. IHeartMedia skipped a $106 million interest payment on Feb. 1, triggering a 30-day grace period during which the company has tried to hammer out a deal with it bondholders. The company disclosed on Monday it was still exchanging proposals with its creditors, but had yet to reach an agreement. Its most recent proposal would have given holders of secured loans, who are owed nearly $13 billion, about $5.6 billion in new debt and 94 percent of the equity in a reorganized iHeartMedia. These creditors also would have received iHeartMedia\u2019s 89.5 percent stake in Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings. Bain Capital LLC and Thomas H. Lee Partners LP control 68 percent of the voting stock of iHeartMedia, according to the company\u2019s most recent annual report. The private equity firms led a $17.9 billion leveraged buyout of what was then Clear Channel Communications Inc in 2008, just as the buyout boom was fading and as the signs of the financial crisis began to emerge. Shares of iHeartMedia lost three-quarters of their value in the second half of 2015 and have never recovered since then. On Monday, the pink sheet stock closed at 48 cents. IHeartMedia traces its roots to the 1972 purchase of KEEZ-FM in San Antonio, Texas, where it is currently headquartered. It also produces syndicated radio programs that feature  American Idol  host Ryan Seacrest and political personalities Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. The company had 14,300 employees at the end of 2016, according to its most recent annual report. "

            "text": "Toys R Us, an iconic U.S. retailer of children\u2019s toys, has announced plans to file liquidation papers and likely close most if not all of its remaining stores, potentially impacting up to 33,000 U.S. workers. In a conference call with staff on Wednesday, reported on by The Wall Street Journal, CEO David Brandon said the company would file the papers ahead of a bankruptcy court hearing Thursday.  I have always believed that this brand and this business should exist in the U.S.,  Brandon told employees. The CEO blamed the liquidation on a number of factors, including vendors who didn\u2019t support the company during the crucial holiday season and customers who choose to shop elsewhere. They  will all live to regret what\u2019s happening here,  Brandon said. A representative for Toys R Us on Wednesday confirmed the Journal\u2019s report and noted that there would not be an immediate shut down.  Administrators for the retailer also said Wednesday that the company plans to close all 75 remaining stores in the United Kingdom, which will affect roughly 3,000 workers. The big box retailer, which has some 1,600 Toys R Us and Babies R Us stores around the world, filed for bankruptcy in September over $5 billion in long-term debt. The company said the debt had prevented it from investing to compete in what it called  an increasingly challenging and rapidly changing retail marketplace worldwide.  The company missed payments to several suppliers in recent days, Bloomberg reported, prompting some to speculate that liquidation was likely on the horizon. The toy chain is already in the process of closing down about 180 of its more than 800 U.S. stores. A CNBC report Wednesday cited people familiar with the situation who said the retailer was working on a proposal to keep about 200 stores open even after the liquidation. The plan may include selling the company\u2019s Canadian operations, along with roughly 200 of the company\u2019s most profitable U.S. stores, to a new buyer, according to CNBC. "

            "text": "In a complaint filed Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission leveled charges of  massive fraud  against Elizabeth Holmes, founder and CEO of the Silicon Valley startup Theranos \u2015 charges Holmes has agreed to settle. The SEC also named former Theranos President Ramesh  Sunny  Balwani in its complaint, accusing Holmes and Balwani of raising over $700 million from investors  through an elaborate, years-long fraud in which they exaggerated or made false statements about the company\u2019s technology, business, and financial performance.  Per the SEC, the settlements are subject to court approval, and neither Theranos nor Holmes has admitted to or denied the allegations against them. The privately held startup had promised to revolutionize the blood testing industry, claiming its proprietary technology could run more than 240 tests on a single drop of blood. Fueled by that claim, and by an early (and ultimately doomed) partnership with Walgreens, Theranos hit a valuation of around $9 billion in 2014. But by 2016, as news began to spread that Theranos\u2019 technology might not be up to snuff, the company\u2019s value tanked, wiping out Holmes\u2019 $4.5 billion net worth with it. Wednesday\u2019s SEC complaint asserts that the company\u2019s claims about its technological abilities were misrepresentations at best and outright lies at worst. For instance, Theranos claimed the U.S. Department of Defense deployed its portable blood analyzers to Afghanistan for use aboard medevac helicopters, generating $100 million in revenue in 2014. Not only did the DOD never do such a thing, but Theranos\u2019 2014 revenues were actually closer to $100,000.  The Theranos story is an important lesson for Silicon Valley,  Jina Choi, director of the SEC\u2019s San Francisco Regional Office, said in a release.  Innovators who seek to revolutionize and disrupt an industry must tell investors the truth about what their technology can do today, not just what they hope it might do someday.  As part of the settlement, Holmes has agreed to pay a $500,000 penalty and relinquish 18.9 million shares of Theranos stock and her voting control in the company. She\u2019s also been barred from serving as a director of a public company for 10 years. "

            "text": "Facebook isn\u2019t typically shy about proclaiming its support for women. After all, chief operating officer and  Lean In  author Sheryl Sandberg built her brand on feminism. Last year, the tech giant even took the rare step of publicizing its own rules and practices on sexual harassment. But on one critical policy, Facebook is awfully wishy-washy: forced arbitration. Facebook is one of many companies that requires employees to take legal disputes, like discrimination or wage claims, to private courtrooms. The process has come under fire for its role in silencing victims of sexual harassment, especially in the wake of the Me Too movement. In a series of conversations with HuffPost over the past few weeks, Facebook representatives took part in a strange dance: They defended the company\u2019s use of forced arbitration, but also said Facebook was considering its position on a bipartisan bill that would make forced arbitration illegal in sexual harassment cases.  We\u2019re studying it and haven\u2019t taken a position,  a Facebook spokesman told HuffPost.  Adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, put arbitration back in the headlines this month, after an arbitrator ordered her to stay silent about her alleged affair with President Donald Trump. The arbitration process Facebook uses is very  official and appropriate,  a spokeswoman told HuffPost. She pointed out that although the social networking giant uses arbitration, it doesn\u2019t require that participants keep silent, as other employers often do. (HuffPost could find no evidence of any employee speaking publicly about litigation against the company.) Arbitration is good for employees because matters are kept private, she said. She also argued that arbitration is a neutral practice, pointing out that the company and its accuser both have a say in which judge they use. She emphasized that Facebook takes harassment seriously and has an in-depth training process for employees.  Our philosophy is to prevent these claims in the first place,  she said. In a statement issued on Wednesday, hours after HuffPost published this story, the company\u2019s head of employment law, Heidi Swartz, wrote,  Facebook does not use \u2018secret courts\u2019 to handle sexual harassment cases as alleged by HuffPost. That claim is false and misleading. We have never had an employee file a sexual harassment arbitration.   If the past year or so has taught us anything, it\u2019s that even companies with the best intentions and the most sensitive executive leaders don\u2019t catch every bad actor. Opponents of forced arbitration say that getting rid of such secretive practices is key to combating sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace.  The easiest mistake any employer can make is to assume that \u2018this could never happen here,\u2019  Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote in a December blog post announcing that the company would no longer send harassment to arbitration.  While it\u2019s natural to hope and believe that\u2019s the case, one of the fundamental lessons of recent months is that people\u2019s voices need to be heard if their problems are to be addressed.  (Microsoft is currently in the middle of a gender discrimination suit filed by a former female technical employee.) Microsoft is the one major tech company that\u2019s thrown its support behind the the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Harassment Act. The bill, introduced by Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.) in December, would make it illegal to force employees to take sexual harassment suits to private arbitration. Instead, employees would have a choice in the matter, giving them more leverage in going up against a deep-pocketed corporation.  I\u2019m glad Facebook says they feel they\u2019re taking harassment seriously, but I had hope that they\u2019d actually Lean In and lead by example on this,  Bustos told HuffPost, using Sandberg\u2019s book title to make her point.  All businesses need to take a look at this issue. Time\u2019s up on letting companies use legal tools to sweep harassment under the rug,  she said. It\u2019s unclear where the other tech giants stand on the issue: Google and Apple did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s requests to talk about the bill. Amazon would only say that it doesn\u2019t use arbitration. But the bill actually has some bipartisan support, cosponsored in the House by Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) and in the Senate by Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). Former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson is also pushing for the legislation, helping announce it on Capitol Hill at the end of the year. Carlson drew attention to forced arbitration in 2016 by maneuvering around her employment contract and suing her harasser directly in court.  The bill gives women (and men) a choice: do they want a harassment claim to go to secret arbitration, or utilize their 7th amendment right and go to a public court?  Carlson said in a message to HuffPost.  Any company outwardly lobbying against this bill makes one wonder what they may have to hide.  Because of the secrecy of the arbitration process, it\u2019s difficult to say how many women it silences. In one egregious example, The Washington Post was able to learn about hundreds of women accusing Sterling Jewelers, the multibillion dollar company behind Kay Jewelers and Jared, of widespread discrimination.  Bustos said that the Sterling story was the first time she\u2019d even heard of forced arbitration, and it inspired her to craft this legislation. For every journalistic scoop, however, many more cases are forever buried. Facebook has spent thousands of dollars lobbying on the arbitration bill, according to public records. But there\u2019s no indication in the record of where the company stands on the bill. Facebook, for its part, said that the money was spent to research the legislation, not to argue a particular stance. As of publication, Facebook\u2019s lobbying firm had not amended its lobbying disclosure.  Facebook has hundreds of lawyers and lobbyists advising them on law and policy. We are talking about a two-page bill that was introduced last year on an issue that is in the news every day,  said Andrew Rogers, the director of legislative affairs at the American Association of Justice, a nonprofit advocacy group for plaintiffs lawyers that opposes arbitration.  Any company that says it is still \u2018mulling it over\u2019 isn\u2019t acting in good faith, and is just hoping the movement quietly fades away,  Rogers said. Microsoft endorsed the bill last year, he pointed out. Another sign that the bill has momentum: In February, all 50 state attorneys general took the rare step of joining together to call companies to end the practice and for Congress to pass the bill.  Ending mandatory arbitration of sexual harassment claims would help to put a stop to the culture of silence that protects perpetrators at the cost of their victims,  the letter says. About 60.1 million workers in the U.S. are beholden to mandatory arbitration clauses, according to a study released last year by the progressive Economic Policy Institute. Many of them have no idea; you can agree to give up your right to file a lawsuit simply by accepting an employee handbook. Employees win in arbitration only 21 percent of the time, according to an earlier paper from EPI \u2015 a much lower rate than you\u2019d find in state or federal court. And if they win, monetary damages are far lower as well \u2015 less than half of what a victim would be awarded in court. If a victim loses, many companies will require her to pay arbitration fees. Many employee complaints never even make it to arbitration, because the deck is so stacked against them. For one thing, lawyers are reluctant to take on clients in arbitration where payouts are much lower, writes NYU law professor Cynthia Estlund in a working paper published in February called  The black hole of mandatory arbitration.  Almost half of companies that use arbitration clauses also include language in them that prevents employees from joining together in class action suits, Estlund notes. That means that if a group of female employees were all harassed by the same man, they would each have to sue the company individually. That\u2019s a huge disadvantage to employees, who are already far less empowered than the company they\u2019re fighting. The issue is currently before the Supreme Court. Former Facebook engineer Chia Hong sued Facebook for sexual harassment and discrimination in 2015. Hong alleged she was frequently ignored and belittled in meetings where she was sometimes the only woman, was admonished for taking a personal day each month to volunteer at her kid\u2019s school, and was ordered to serve drinks to male colleagues.  Her case was dismissed that year, but it\u2019s not clear why. Facebook would only say that it didn\u2019t go to arbitration. Meanwhile, with or without Facebook\u2019s support, it remains unlikely that the bill will be brought to the floor in the Republican-majority House anytime soon. Bustos has been tweeting at House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) every day this month, asking him to bring the bill to a vote.  This is in his hands. He could make a decision or he could take the side of sexual harassers,  she said. Last week, on International Women\u2019s Day, her tweet to Ryan was particularly poignant.  Instead of sending Congress home before noon on #InternationalWomensDay, we should have been voting on our bipartisan bill to drive #SexualHarassment out of the workplace,  Bustos wrote. Also on International Women\u2019s Day, Sandberg wrote a passionate Facebook tribute to women.  I\u2019m more dedicated than ever to creating a more equal world that will also be a better world,  she wrote at the end of a long status about women\u2019s rights. Clarification: Language in this story has been amended to clarify that it was Facebook\u2019s lobbying arm, and not Facebook itself, that had not amended its lobbying disclosure by publication time.

            "text": "In early January, a Tennessee pastor who stood accused of sexual assault received a standing ovation from members of his evangelical Christian congregation after confessing to a  sexual incident  with a woman 20 years before. Now, the woman who went public with her allegations against her former youth pastor is again speaking out about her experience, this time urging American churches to more fully reckon with their responsibility to sexual assault victims.  We as a church, of all places, should be getting this right,  Jules Woodson said in a New York Times op-ed video published on Friday.  It\u2019s unfathomable to me that the secular world, Hollywood, are taking a stand. The church should have been the first group to stand up and say, \u2018We will not allow this.\u2019  Woodson came forward in January with allegations against her former youth pastor, Andy Savage. She claims that when she was 17 in 1998, Savage drove her to a private location after a church event in Texas and forced her to perform sexual acts. She said church leaders at Woodlands Parkway Baptist Church (which later changed its name to StoneBridge Church) urged her to keep quiet and promised the church would take care of the matter internally. Savage later moved to Memphis, where he eventually became a pastor at Highpoint Church.  After Woodson came forward with her story in January, Highpoint Church initially said that it had  total confidence in the redemptive process  Savage went through after he allegedly assaulted Woodson. Savage was placed on leave after the church received backlash in the national media \u2015 one critic called the congregation\u2019s response, which was streamed online, the standing ovation  heard round the world.  Savage said during his apology that he told Highpoint\u2019s lead pastor about the incident before coming on board as staff. The New York Times filmed Woodson\u2019s reactions to a video recording of Savage delivering his apology at Highpoint Church. Woodson criticized the apology, pointing out that Savage called what happened to her a  sexual incident  and repeatedly referred to the fact that it happened decades ago.  I was and remain very remorseful for the incident and deeply regret the pain I caused her and her family as well as the pain I caused the church and God\u2019s kingdom,  Savage said during his apology.  My repentance over this sin 20 years ago was done believing that God\u2019s forgiveness is greater than any sin. And I still believe that.  Woodson was in tears as she spoke in the op-ed video about the alleged crime and her church\u2019s response.  I looked up to him. I trusted him,  Woodson said about Savage in the video.  What happened was a crime. This is not something that the church should handle internally.    I want our churches to change how they handle sexual assault,  she added.  Sexual assault in the church. It\u2019s a crime, not just a sexual sin.  Woodson\u2019s words echo the reflections of other survivors of sexual abuse in Christian communities. Inspired by the Me Too movement, survivors have used the hashtag #ChurchToo to share stories of abuse that happens in church settings. Hannah Paasch, one of the founders of #ChurchToo, claims that a culture of purity in evangelical church settings has created the ideal of a  gentle and quiet  woman who accept the authority and leadership of men.   The stories that have poured in through the hashtag prove to me that the evangelical church, in its current iteration, actively supports the confessing abuser over the victim and, in the name of \u2018having no appearance of evil,\u2019 has managed to silence thousands of sexual and physical abuse allegations throughout the years,  Paasch wrote in an op-ed for HuffPost.  Historian Neil J. Young, who studies the religious right, wrote that evangelical churches often tend to place the abuser at the center of the story, making the priority  forgiveness for his sins rather than justice for her injury.    It is his words of confession and embarrassment, but also often rationalization, that a church body gathers together to hear on a Sunday morning, not her cries of rage and pain that they must confront,  Young wrote in an op-ed for HuffPost.  If #MeToo has been about breaking the silence, the evangelical response has been to allow the abuser\u2019s voice to fill the void.  Highpoint has initiated two investigations into how the church handled the allegations against Savage, and whether its current policies are sufficient to safeguard the safety of children. On March 4, the church released a statement saying that the investigation was  wrapping up  and that its initial findings  give us assurance that we can begin the long process of moving forward as a church.  Highpoint did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.  Just as the culture around us is waking up to the suffering expressed by the courageous voices of the #metoo movement, we are taking very seriously our commitment to fully understand how our church should minister to the needs of the people we impact,  the church wrote on its website.

He\u2019s already being done in. There\u2019s no advantage in piling on again,  Carter told Tim Teeman in an interview published Monday. Although Carter refused to divulge the name of her abuser, she said he\u2019s being punished for his crimes \u2015 although  it isn\u2019t enough.  According to Carter, her abuser violated  a lot of people.  She told The Daily Beast that she had initially researched pursuing legal action, but later came to the conclusion that it wouldn\u2019t help.   I can\u2019t add anything to it. I wish I could,  Carter said of the justice her abuser has faced.  But there\u2019s nothing legally I could add to it, because I looked into it. I\u2019m just another face in the crowd. I wish I could, and if I could I would.  Carter said she didn\u2019t want to shift the focus of the conversation to her.  I don\u2019t want it to be about me, it\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about him being a scumbag,  she said. Carter said it\u2019s been very powerful watching the Me Too movement unfold \u2015 albeit somewhat triggering.  I asked my husband if he was surprised by all the #MeToo stories. \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m surprised,\u2019 he said,  Carter told The Daily Beast.  Ask any woman, they\u2019re not surprised. It\u2019s been going on for years. It\u2019s not news to us [women], but it is news to you [men]. We\u2019ve been trying to tell you. We\u2019ve been trying to tell you for a long time and you haven\u2019t listened.  Carter said she experienced sexual harassment on the  Wonder Woman  set, including a cameraman who secretly drilled a hole in her dressing room to watch her change.   They caught him, fired him, and drummed him out of the business,  she said. She said that the punishment for her harasser was quite an anomaly at the time, adding later that she rarely reported the workplace harassment and abuse she faced.   Who are you going to tell? Who you are going to tell except your girlfriends and your circle of friends? You\u2019d say or hear, \u2018Stay away from that guy.\u2019 \u2018Watch out for this casting director.\u2019 And so you would hear it from other people, other people would hear it from other people. \u2018Watch out for so and so,\u2019  Carter said.  That\u2019s how you protected yourself: through the grapevine. We were women\u2019s lib, burn the bra. We weren\u2019t going to take any shit from people. So we felt strong in that, but there were still not a lot of parts for us.  Carter added that she believes  every woman  in the Bill Cosby case and she believes the 21 women who have come forward with accusations of sexual harassment and assault against President Donald Trump.   Why would they lie?  she asked.  I believe the women.  Head over to The Daily Beast to read Carter\u2019s full interview.  "

A new Harris Poll found that nearly one out of four (23 percent) men in countries across the world thought it was sometimes or always acceptable for an employer to expect sex from an employee.

            "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Martin Shkreli, the former drug company executive who made headlines by jacking up the price of a lifesaving drug before he was found guilty of defrauding investors, was sentenced to 7 years and a $75,000 fine on Friday. The sentence from U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, was shorter than the 15 years asked for by prosecutors but much longer than the 12 to 18 monthsShkreli\u2019s lawyers had sought. Shkreli\u2019s lawyer Benjamin Brafman told the judge before the sentencing that Shkreli, 34, suffered from depression and an anxiety disorder and was a  somewhat broken  person, whom the government wanted to  throw away.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacquelyn Kasulis had said a 15 year sentence was justified in part because Shkreli\u2019s crimes were not an  isolated lapse in judgment,  but a pattern of conduct including separate frauds for his two hedge funds and for his drug company Retrophin Inc. The Brooklyn-born entrepreneur became known as the  Pharma Bro  in September 2015 after founding Turing Pharmaceuticals, buying the anti-parasitic drug Daraprim and raising its price by 5,000 percent to $750 per pill. Shkreli was indicted for the unrelated securities fraud charges in December 2015. At the hearing, Shkreli had choked up as he said he had learned from his mistakes.  There is no conspiracy to take down Martin Shkreli. I took down Martin Shkreli with my disgraceful and shameful actions,  he said. A jury in August found Shkreli guilty of defrauding investors in two hedge funds he ran, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare, by sending them fake account statements and concealing huge losses. He was also convicted of scheming to prop up the stock price of Retrophin, the drug company he founded in 2011. The $75,000 fine comes on top of $7.36 million in forfeiture Shkreli had already been ordered to pay following his conviction. Brafman, noting that he was old enough to be Shkreli\u2019s father, said his client had not always been easy to work with.  There are times when I want to hug him and hold him and comfort him and there are times when I want to punch him in the face,  Brafman said. Kasulis said Brafman was trying to portray Shkreli as  a child.   Mr. Shkreli is about to turn 35 years old,  she said   He is a man who needs to take responsibility for his actions.  Shkreli has been in jail since September, when Matsumoto revoked his bail after he offered his social media followers $5,000 if they could bring him a hair from former U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

            "text": "For the past four years, the Voices of Faith conference has brought prominent Catholic women from around the world to the Vatican to highlight women\u2019s voices and their contributions. But this year, the Vatican\u2019s approach to the International Women\u2019s Day event has caused a great deal of controversy \u2015 even prompting one prominent Catholic leader to call her church an  an empire of misogyny.  Unlike in past years, this year\u2019s conference had to be held outside the Vatican\u2019s walls. Conference organizers claim a Vatican organization rejected some women on their list of proposed speakers \u2015 including a lesbian Catholic activist and other women who have been vocal about challenging the church\u2019s stance on homosexuality.  Instead of letting go of these speakers, organizers moved the International Women\u2019s Day event outside of the Vatican to the auditorium of the Jesuit headquarters. At a time when women around the world are speaking up against abuse and demanding greater gender equality, the Vatican\u2019s actions to silence these women speakers have prompted some Catholics to reflect on whether the church really values women\u2019s voices. Ssenfuka Joanita Warry, a lesbian Catholic activist from Uganda, was reportedly one of the women whose presence at the conference did not meet the approval of the Vatican.  During the conference, Warry spoke about what life was like for her as a lesbian activist in a country where homosexuality is illegal. She condemned the silence of religious leaders in the face of this discrimination against queer Ugandans.  Warry said she believes it\u2019s her responsibility to open up dialogue about the church\u2019s teachings about women and queer Catholics.  I believe it is my responsibility, my duty, my role to change the mentality that surrounds me because I believe I\u2019m on a mission from God,  she said.  There is much more I\u2019d want to do in the church, but I\u2019m often limited by my sexual orientation and gender, which was created by God.   I believe things can be different. Women have a lot of roles they can do in the church. Let no one stand in the way of the holy spirit,  she added. Watch a livestream of the Voices of Faith conference below. The Voices of Faith conference is typically held in a small palazzo in the Vatican gardens, according to the Associated Press. In the past, the conference has addressed issues like women\u2019s activism in immigration and education. This year\u2019s conference is organized around the theme  Why Women Matter.  Organizers aimed to spark conversation about how women can become more involved in the decision-making structures of a church dominated by male clergy. Sessions address topics like where Catholic women can look for female role models and whether the church is relevant to young women. In one panel discussion, organizers put forward the question:  Will the Catholic Church survive the 21st century?   If current leaders of the Roman Curia do not include capable qualified women in roles that are theoretically open to them, we face a future where the Catholic Church will be a relic of the past,  the organizers state in a program booklet for the conference.  Our world is changing and the inclusion of women in significant positions is finally being realised. We won\u2019t allow gender inequality to undermine the longevity of the Church.  Cardinal Kevin Farrell, head of the Vatican Dicastery for Laity, Family and Life, reportedly made the decision to reject certain women from Voices of Faith\u2019s proposed speakers list. Along with Warry, Farrell also apparently rejected Tina Beattie, a Catholic feminist and academic, and Mary McAleese, a former president of Ireland and an expert in canon law. Asked about Farrell\u2019s decision, Vatican spokesman Greg Burke told the AP in February that it\u2019s  not a Vatican-sponsored event, and given the nature of the topics being discussed, there should not be confusion about that.  McAleese, the mother of a gay son, has been vocal about welcoming LGBTQ Catholics in the church. She said a church that is  homophobic and anti-abortion  is not the church of the future. During the conference, McAleese challenged Pope Francis to develop a strategy for the inclusion of women in the Catholic Church.  How long can the hierarchy sustain the credibility of a God who wants ... a church where women are invisible and voiceless in church leadership, in legal and doctrinal discernment and decision-making, but actually are expected to do all the hard work that keeps the church going from generation to generation?  McAleese asked while delivering the keynote speech at the conference on Thursday.   Today, the Catholic Church lags noticeably behind the world\u2019s advanced nations in the elimination of discrimination against women, a disgrace to an organization that claims to be created by God for love in the universe.  Pope Francis declined to attend the conference, the BBC reports.  In the past, Pope Francis has spoken of the need to  broaden the opportunities for a stronger presence of women in the church.  He\u2019s appointed women to key positions within the Vatican. Although he\u2019s said there\u2019s no possibility women could become priests in the Catholic Church, he has expressed an interest in clarifying whether there\u2019s historical precedent for women to serve as ordained deacons, who can perform some duties of a priest. Still, many at the Voices of Faith conference said there\u2019s much more the Vatican can do to make use of the gifts and talents of women in the church. McAleese pointed out that Catholic women are often the backbone of their local churches. They are tasked with instilling Catholic values in their children, for example. Despite all the work Catholic women do, McAleese said, the church has not done enough to listen to the voices and opinions of the women in its folds.   Here we are. We are left to talk among ourselves,  McAleese said during her keynote speech.  No church leader bothers to turn up, not just because we do not matter but because their priestly formation prepares them to resist treating us as full equals.    The time for change is now.   "

President Donald Trump\u2019s daughter-turned-White House adviser got an earful on Thursday after turning to Twitter to mark International Women\u2019s Day \u2015 leading to immediate ridicule by people who criticized her and her father for their track record on women\u2019s rights.  Today we come together in recognition of women at home & around the globe,  she tweeted.  We celebrate women\u2019s achievements, past & present, & pledge to empower women to reach their full economic potential for generations to come. When women thrive, we ALL succeed.  Ivanka Trump has said she would make  women\u2019s empowerment  a key issue in her father\u2019s White House.  But people on Twitter, responding to her post, listed reasons why Trump\u2019s latest   pledge to empower women  could use some work.  Critics pointed to her business practices. Her clothing brand\u2019s merchandise is produced in foreign factories, where laborers \u2015 both men and women \u2015 receive low wages and have limited ability to advocate for themselves. Other people on Twitter slammed the powerful White House roles handed to Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, which some see as nepotism. Twitter users also criticized Trump for failing to forcefully speak out against her father\u2019s misbehavior toward women. The president, who once said his star power entitles him to grab women by the genitals, has been accused of sexual misconduct by 21 women. In recent days it was reported that Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer attempted to silence adult film star Stormy Daniels, who says she had an affair with Trump while he was married to Melania Trump. Some Twitter users reminded Ivanka Trump of her demonstrated ability to flip-flop between her roles as White House adviser and first daughter, depending on the circumstances. Recently, for example, she was asked during an interview to comment on allegations of sexual misconduct against the president. She called it  a pretty inappropriate question to ask a daughter.  The backlash against Ivanka Trump\u2019s Womens\u2019 Day tweet, of course, is nothing new. Just days earlier, she was skewered on social media for a similar comment about Women\u2019s History Month.

            "text": "By Ankur Banerjee (Reuters) - U.S. health insurer Cigna Corp <CI.N> said on Thursday it would buy pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co <ESRX.O> for about $54 billion, the latest deal in the sector aimed at tackling soaring healthcare costs. The move follows the $69 billion merger of insurer Aetna Inc <AET.N> and drugstore chain CVS Health Corp <CVS.N> announced last December, and highlights a sector-wide trend toward deals between companies that do not have directly overlapping operations. The deals seek to lower healthcare costs by bringing under one roof pharmacy and medical claims, and give the combined entities greater leverage in price negotiations with drugmakers. Cigna\u2019s offer consists of $48.75 in cash and 0.2434 shares of stock of the combined company for each Express Scripts share, amounting to $96.03 per share. That represents a premium of nearly 31 percent to Express Scripts\u2019 Wednesday closing price. Express Scripts shares were up 18.6 percent at $87.10, while Cigna shares were down 4.25 percent at $186. The transaction is valued at $67 billion, including about $15 billion in Express Scripts\u2019 debt, the company said. Pharmacy benefit managers administer prescription drug programs for health insurers, self-insured companies and government agencies, negotiating deals with drug manufacturers, working with pharmacies and processing claims. The CVS-Aetna deal was seen pressuring rival insurers, drugmakers, PBMs and retail pharmacies to consider mergers or switching partners to try to keep up with the potential healthcare cost savings or increase in profit margins. The wave of consolidation in the sector also comes in the backdrop of a shifting landscape, including changes in the U.S. Affordable Care Act, rising drug prices and the threat of competition from Amazon.com Inc <AMZN.O>. Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte said the deal may surprise investors given Cigna has said that they are satisfied with their PBM arrangement with UnitedHealth\u2019s <UNH.N> Optum unit.  It is possible that the threat of an Amazon entry into the healthcare and possibly the drug supply chain landscape, with the latest news of the Amazon/Berkshire Hathaway/JPMorgan employer coalition has spurred Cigna and Express Scripts to tie the knot.  Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway Inc <BRKa.N> and JPMorgan Chase & Co <JPM.N> said in January they would form a company to cut health costs for hundreds of thousands of their employees.   After the deal closes, Cigna shareholders will own about 64 percent of the combined company and Express Scripts shareholders the rest. Cigna intends to fund the cash portion of the deal through a combination of cash on hand, Express Scripts debt and new debt issuance. The company is expected to have debt of about $41.1 billion after the deal closes. The insurer said it obtained fully committed debt financing from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd for the deal. The combined company will be led by current Cigna Chief Executive Officer David Cordani. The deal comes a year after Cigna\u2019s deal to buy Anthem Inc <ANTM.N> was blocked by antitrust regulators. Morgan Stanley was the financial adviser to Cigna and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz was the legal adviser. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP is providing regulatory counsel. Centerview Partners and Lazard Fr\u00e8res were financial advisers to Express Scripts, with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP serving as legal counsel and Holland & Knight LLP as regulatory counsel.

Feminism has become so trendy that major national brands are joining in, celebrating the female consumer\u2019s steady march toward gender equality even if their own corporate histories are marked by practices harmful to women.  Behold these examples:  Barbie Mattel has announced a new line of Barbie dolls modeled after inspirational women from history, including Frida Kahlo, Amelia Earhart and Kathleen Johnson, the NASA mathematician featured in the film  Hidden Figures.  Although the brand announced a line of  realistic  dolls back in 2016, the new ones appear to maintain the same rail-thin measurements that have fueled Barbie criticism for decades. Research has shown that Barbie\u2019s physique can have a negative impact on young girls\u2019 body image. Budweiser AdWeek reports that from Thursday through the end of March, Budweiser will honor contributions made by female employees by posting their photos on the company\u2019s social media pages.  Yet, in 2018, Budweiser still employs  Budweiser Girls,  the young, mostly white women who dress in skimpy clothing to promote the brand. The brewery also found itself in some hot water back in 2015 for a Bud Light ad campaign that struck many as tone-deaf in light of the emerging national discussion on sexual consent. Titled  Up for Whatever,  the campaign included labels printed with,  The perfect beer for removing \u2018no\u2019 from your vocabulary for the night.  Bud earned some good PR the following year for an ad highlighting equal pay. However, the company still counts just two women among its 13-member North American executive leadership team. ESPN A new 30-second spot from ESPN celebrates women\u2019s achievements in sports to promote the upcoming NCAA Women\u2019s Basketball Championship. Yet a 2017 Boston Globe expose detailed a culture of rampant sexism at the network. Women at ESPN reported feeling pressured to hide their pregnancies and take short maternity leaves in a professional environment where unwanted sexual advances by male colleagues were plentiful. Some men at ESPN openly rated women on their appearance, the Globe reported. ESPN has faced legal action over its work culture in the past, and just this week, former anchor Adrienne Lawrence filed a sexual harassment and discrimination lawsuit against the network. Let\u2019s also not forget ESPN\u2019s short-lived partnership with Barstool Sports, a website with a well-documented history of publishing content grossly disrespectful toward women.  Google Thursday\u2019s Google Doodle celebrates 12 female artists and encourages people to share stories about inspiring women in their own lives with the hashtag #HerStoryOurStory. A Google trends page, g.co/womensday, also shows how global interest in gender equality has increased. The Google Doodle team has a history of shining light on important women and people of color in history, but the tech giant as a whole is another matter. Last summer, Google faced questions over misogyny in its corporate environment after a memo written by a male employee was made public. The memo described how biology made women less successful in the tech industry and was circulated widely on Google\u2019s internal discussion boards for days without action by the company. While the memo\u2019s author was fired, the incident reportedly sparked a heated discussion on gender and discrimination within the company. Currently, Google faces a lawsuit over its alleged  bro culture  brought by a software engineer, Loretta Lee, who worked for the tech giant from 2008 to 2016.  McDonald\u2019s The fast-food staple flipped its golden arches across its numerous social media channels on Thursday, turning the iconic  M  into a  W.

As discussed by HuffPost\u2019s Willa Frej, sexual harassment is common in the fast-food industry, and McDonald\u2019s is no different. The chain has fostered  a company culture steeped in unfair treatment of women,  receiving sexual harassment complaints by workers in eight states in 2016. Two in five women experience sexual misconduct in fast-food jobs, according to a 2016 Hart Research study, yet many do not report the harassment for fear of losing work. "

The former first lady recently interviewed four young women from around the world for an International Women\u2019s Day feature for Refinery29. In partnership with the Obama Foundation, Refinery29\u2032s feature spotlighted the four teenagers from Nepal, Ghana, Guatemala and Chicago to highlight the important of empowering girls with education.  Alejandra Teleguario Santizo, a 17-year-old from Guatemala who has organized her community to rally against sexual violence, asked Michelle Obama what advice she would give to young women like herself who are looking to blaze their own paths and become leaders.   My best advice to girls, including my own daughters, is do not be afraid to fail. So often, our own fear of failure is the thing that keeps us back,  Obama said.  We think we have to be perfect, that if we make even the tiniest mistake, it\u2019s a catastrophe. That\u2019s simply not true!  She added that the only way to succeed is life  is by failing and failing well.    You cannot let your failures eat you up or make you want to quit,  Obama said.  You have to learn from them, let them challenge and inspire you to do more \u2015 to take some risks and to step outside of your comfort zone.  Obama also told Santizo another important key to success: Be kind to other women.   I also advise girls to be supportive of each other. I cannot say this enough! Too often we\u2019re taught that we have to compete, or that someone else\u2019s failure is our success,  she said.  But we can all rise together; we can all win. We have to be a team of women and girls who love each other and value each other and cherish one another. Because if we don\u2019t cherish each other, no one else will.  Obama and her husband, former President Barack Obama, have been working to educate more girls around the world since they launched the Let Girls Learn initiative in 2015. The program brings together several international organizations to address the variety of challenges preventing girls from getting an education.  Eva Lewis, a 19-year-old activist and artist from the South Side of Chicago (where Obama also grew up), asked her how education can be liberating for everyone, but especially girls. Her answer did not disappoint.   I always tell students that if you focus on school right now, you will have all kinds of freedom later on in your life,  Obama said.  You\u2019ll have the freedom to choose a career you enjoy and to earn a living that supports your family. That is truly liberating. And that\u2019s not just true here in America.  When girls get an education, their whole world changes, Obama noted.  Right now, millions of adolescent girls around the world actually don\u2019t have the chance to go to school. Imagine if, at the age of 10 or 11 or 12, someone came to you and said, \u2018Sorry, you\u2019re a girl, you\u2019re finished with your education. Forget about all your dreams. Instead you\u2019ll marry a man twice your age and start having babies,\u2019  she said.  When we give girls an education, it can help liberate them from that kind of life. Educated girls marry later, have lower rates of infant and maternal mortality, and are more likely to immunize their children and less likely to contract malaria and HIV. Studies also show that girls who are educated earn higher salaries, and sending more girls to school and into the workforce can boost an entire country\u2019s GDP,  Obama continued.  So education can liberate individuals, families, and even nations.  Head over to Refinery29\u2032s feature and make sure to click through to read each individual interview.

            "text": "By Richard Tolman, University of Michigan / The Conversation Can President Donald Trump\u2019s recent repudiation of domestic violence actually help prevent it? Rob Porter, a high-level aide to Trump, was accused of serial domestic violence by his two ex-wives. The controversy dominated news coverage earlier this month. Trump publicly denounced domestic violence one week after Porter resigned, saying  I\u2019m totally opposed to domestic violence of any kind.  Those who called for such a statement by the president may be motivated by the belief that when powerful men convincingly call out abusers, society\u2019s acceptance of domestic violence can be diminished. There is not a lot of research to support this commonsense idea. But there is a growing body of work with men and boys that research shows can be effective in diminishing domestic violence. This is a significant evolution in the field. Since the establishment of the first domestic violence shelters in the 1970s, domestic violence policies and services have rightly focused most attention on survivors and meeting their needs for safety and healing. Increasingly, though, domestic violence organizations are adopting approaches that involve men and boys in domestic violence prevention. The idea is that by addressing the root causes, these programs can stop domestic violence from occurring in the first place. I am a professor who studies how to intervene and prevent men\u2019s violence against women. Our research team has researched the effectiveness of programs that involve boys and men in domestic violence prevention efforts. Much of the work being done with men and boys is not well-known, despite the fact that this is a thriving movement. Here is a snapshot of some of those efforts, both global and local, and what we know about their effectiveness. Some efforts to involve men are directed in the arena of sports because, well, men like sports. They venerate sports figures and identify with teams. Reports of domestic violence perpetrated by athletes have grown more common. This has led to visible efforts by sports organizations to respond with sanctions for perpetrators and to become part of prevention efforts, like the NFL\u2019s No More. The seriousness and effectiveness of these efforts are yet to be determined. But sports have also been the site of innovative and effective interventions for youth. Coaching Boys Into Men provides high school athletic coaches with the resources they need help prevent relationship abuse, harassment and sexual assault by their players. The program\u2019s curriculum includes coach-to-athlete trainings that model respect and promote healthy relationships. It also includes a card series to help coaches incorporate themes of teamwork, integrity, fair play and respect into their daily practice and routine. Coaching Boys Into Men has been rigorously evaluated, found to be effective in reducing dating violence, and is being widely implemented in the U.S. and replicated in other countries. A prime risk factor for future abuse is the exposure of children to violence. Preventing abuse in new families would reduce children\u2019s exposure to violence and thus the potential for future violence. One promising strategy is to involve men in prevention efforts as they move into fatherhood. Research shows that a caring and supportive relationship with their fathers reduces the risk of harsh physical discipline by the next generation of parents, both for fathers and mothers. Positive fathering predicts warmer and more positive parenting by adult sons when they become fathers. Strategies that could be used in this area include engaging men at prenatal visits such as ultrasound appointments, which the vast majority of men in the U.S. attend, and at in-home visits during pregnancy and after the birth of a child. Global campaigns such as MenCare seek to improve caregiving by fathers and address partner violence. MenCare\u2019s programs ask men to become more equitable partners and provide them with opportunities to learn and practice parenting skills. They promote policy change, like paid parental leave. And they conduct media campaigns to inspire men and their communities to support men\u2019s caregiving. Studies document high levels of dating violence beginning in middle school. When it comes to prevention, one could argue that programs must intervene early or the effort will be wasted, because stopping abuse before it becomes a entrenched pattern is more likely to be effective in preventing relationship violence. School-based abuse prevention programs like Safe Dates and Fourth R have shown some success in changing attitudes and behavior. The Safe Dates program, for example, uses nine 50-minute sessions, a student-performed 45-minute play and a poster contest, to explore topics on how to cultivate caring relationships, overcome gender stereotypes and help friends.  Bystander  prevention programs, increasingly commonplace on college campuses, build skills to recognize, respond to, and disrupt behavior that might lead to sexual assault or intimate partner violence. Some examples of bystander behavior include telling a man who is saying disrespectful things about women to stop or helping a woman who is being harassed to get away from a situation in which she could be harmed. Teens involved in bystander interventions are more likely to intervene to prevent victimization of their peers. Our research group surveyed men around the world who have been involved in efforts to prevent violence against women. The survey revealed that many men who get involved have a personal experience with violence \u2013 as child witnesses or survivors of their own child abuse. Still others find their way to prevention efforts through a commitment to social justice. Importantly, we found that many men are receptive to violence prevention efforts when they tune in to survivors\u2019 experiences. Given that men are moved by learning about survivors\u2019 experiences, the visibility of and emotional power of the #MeToo movement and the remarkable and vivid accounts of White House aide Rob Portman\u2019s ex-wives can lead men to get involved in ending violence against women. Whatever the pathway, men\u2019s involvement in preventing domestic violence in their families, workplaces and communities can be part of the global effort to promote safety and equality for women, and to end victimization in all its forms.

I just wanted to come and say I\u2019m inspired by all of you,  Wade told the students, many of whom are involved in organizing the upcoming March for Our Lives to demand stronger gun legislation.   As someone out here in the public eye, I\u2019m proud to say I\u2019m from this state because of you guys, because of the future of this world because of you guys,  he continued.  Wade, who was traded back to the Heat just a week before a teen gunman killed 17 students and faculty members at the high school on Feb. 14, has vowed to help spotlight the victims and the survivors\u2019 fight for gun control.  He said he was especially touched after learning one of the teenaged victims, Joaquin Oliver, was buried in a Heat jersey bearing Wade\u2019s name and number.  You\u2019re about to make me cry,  Wade tweeted when he learned of Joaquin\u2019s burial. He dedicated this season to the teen, saying in a tweet:  This is why we will not just SHUT up and dribble!  \u2015 a response to Fox News host Laura Ingraham urging basketball players to stay out of the gun control discussion. Wade invited Oliver\u2019s family to a Heat game earlier this month and delivered an emotional tribute at the time.  We honor the 17 lives that were tragically lost in Parkland,  he said.  We applaud the fearless students that are fighting for their lives. We will also make sure that their voices are heard around gun safety. You are our nation\u2019s inspiration. We salute you and we support you.  Neither the Heat nor the high school immediately responded to HuffPost\u2019s request for more details about Wade\u2019s visit.

            "text": "A man accused of raping a Yale classmate on Halloween 2015 was found not guilty Wednesday by a New Haven, Connecticut, jury after a trial of less than two weeks. A woman referred to only as Jane Doe, now 24, accused Saifullah Khan, now 25, of raping her in her dorm room after she had vomited multiple times from drinking too much alcohol. Khan said that Doe had initiated the sexual encounter, which she said she barely remembered. Khan was found not guilty on all charges of sexual assault in the first, second, third and fourth degrees after his lawyers cast doubt on Doe\u2019s memory and called attention to her clothing. The defense also alleged that Yale officials had influenced the investigation carried out by the university\u2019s own police force, in an effort to prove that Yale took sexual assault seriously.  Research shows that sexual assault occurs on college campuses nationwide, yet relatively few incidents are reported to authorities and even fewer make it to trial. Just how few is unknown. According to the anti-sexual violence organization RAINN, 11.2 percent of undergraduate and graduate students experience rape or sexual assault through physical force, violence or incapacitation. Yet a whopping 89 percent of colleges reported zero incidents of rape in 2015, according to a May 2017 American Association of University Women report using data from the Department of Education. Doe and Khan were both seniors at the time of the alleged assault. While Doe has graduated, Khan, an Afghanistan native studying cognitive science, was suspended in November 2015 and has not returned to the school.  A jury heard testimony from Doe, Khan, law enforcement and various witnesses beginning Feb. 26. Doe told the jurors that she became inebriated after consuming two rum-and-cokes, one shot of hard liquor and two cups of wine at a 2015 Halloween party, the Yale Daily News reported. Her friends testified that she did not typically drink very much, if at all, according to the New Haven Register. Later in the evening, Doe accompanied friends to a Yale Symphony Orchestra concert, but said she vomited at the show and left to use the bathroom. After she was denied re-entry due to her intoxication, Doe said she went back to her dorm, accompanied by Khan. When they got to her room, Doe said Khan restrained and raped her. She also said that Khan took her phone and sent text messages to her friends to let them know she made it back safely. Khan denied the rape accusation and characterized their sexual encounter as consensual, the Register reported. In Khan\u2019s telling, Doe did not appear too intoxicated to consent. The pair had flirted during the concert, he said. When they returned to her dorm, Khan said she did not appear to have difficulty walking. Khan\u2019s attorney Norm Pattis offered an alternate explanation for surveillance footage showing his client supporting Doe as she appeared to stagger forward, the Register wrote.  How many times have you seen young lovers walk across campus in just such a pose? Does it look to you like two lovers out for a stroll?  Pattis asked the jury. Doe testified that she went to a sexual assault counseling center following the alleged incident and then to a hospital to be tested for venereal disease. Hospital photos of bruises on Doe\u2019s legs were shown in court.  What transformed that night from happy into a nightmare was she miscalculated her own tolerance for alcohol,  Supervisory Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Michael Pepper said in his closing arguments.  She ate too little and drank too much. But that\u2019s not criminal. And it doesn\u2019t absolve the defendant,  he said. In his closing argument, Pattis drew attention to Doe\u2019s outfit that night, a  short skirt and tube top,  and suggested she was  dressed to party.   She made up this story because she can\u2019t face the fact that the one night when she took a walk on the wild side, she\u2019s got to face her friends the next day,  Pattis said.  I think she let her friends convince her she\u2019d been raped.  A representative for the prosecutor\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trials over alleged sexual assault on campus may become even less frequent under Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who last year ordered her department to roll back Obama-era rules that aimed to reform systemic mishandling of such cases under Title IX. (Title IX requires the Department of Education to protect students from gender-based discrimination, including sexual harassment and assault.) The department\u2019s Office of Civil Rights also issued a memo last July instructing staff to scale back their investigations at public schools and universities, including in sexual assault cases.

            "text": "Last year during a home game against the Atlanta Hawks, Kevin Love of the Cleveland Cavaliers experienced his first panic attack. The episode not only forced the NBA power forward to leave the game at halftime, it forced him to open up about his struggle with mental health. In an essay for the Players\u2019 Tribune published Tuesday, the 29-year-old athlete detailed what happened when he was hospitalized mid-game in November, how he suffered silently and why he\u2019s speaking out about mental health now.  It came out of nowhere. I\u2019d never had one before. I didn\u2019t even know if they were real,  Love wrote of his panic attack.   But it was real \u2014 as real as a broken hand or a sprained ankle. Since that day, almost everything about the way I think about my mental health has changed.  While Love detailed his panic attack in November, his essay didn\u2019t mention what happened when he left a Jan. 22 game due to an undisclosed illness and later missed a practice. His teammates were reportedly upset over his absences, though things settled down once Love explained to the team during a meeting what was going on, ESPN reported at the time. After Love\u2019s essay was published, Cleveland.com reported Tuesday that Love had disclosed his panic attacks during that meeting. Love said he had recovered from the November incident and performed successfully at a game two days later, but something else had begun troubling him:  Why was I so concerned with people finding out?   Love eventually found help through therapy, which he said he had never thought he\u2019d pursue. Through those sessions, Love wrote, he discovered issues beyond the pressures of the NBA that were weighing him down, including the death of his grandmother.  In the short time I\u2019ve been meeting with the therapist, I\u2019ve seen the power of saying things out loud in a setting like that,  Love wrote.  And it\u2019s not some magical process. It\u2019s terrifying and awkward and hard, at least in my experience so far.  Love said he was inspired to speak out about his mental health issues after the Toronto Raptors\u2019 DeMar DeRozan revealed last month that he has been struggling with depression, feelings of loneliness and anxiety. DeRozan hinted at his issues in a tweet in late February, then later expanded on his experience in an interview with The Toronto Star.  This is real stuff,  DeRozan told the Star.  We\u2019re all human at the end of the day. The Toronto guard added,  My mom always told me: Never make fun of anybody because you never know what that person is going through.  In his essay, Love said that men especially need to know it\u2019s OK to speak up about their feelings \u2015 something he had been uncomfortable with for most of his life.  If you\u2019re suffering silently like I was, then you know how it can feel like nobody really gets it,  Love wrote, before noting what pushed him to write his piece. Partly, I want to do it for me, but mostly, I want to do it because people don\u2019t talk about mental health enough. And men and boys are probably the farthest behind. The stigma around mental health is a very serious problem for men. A 2015 survey found that men are more likely than women to hide thoughts of suicide. And, according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, white men accounted for 7 out of 10 suicides in 2016, while the rate of suicide is highest for middle-aged men. Love addressed this in his essay, calling it an invisible struggle men have to face.  Look, I\u2019m probably not telling you anything new here,  Love wrote.  These values about men and toughness are so ordinary that they\u2019re everywhere \u2026 and invisible at the same time, surrounding us like air or water,  he added.  They\u2019re a lot like depression or anxiety in that way.  Loves\u2019 teammates, and other NBA players, have praised Love for being courageous enough to speak up about his struggles. Now, in response to all of the support, the Cavaliers\u2019 forward is asking for others to share their own stories with him. Read Love\u2019s full essay on mental health here. "

            "text": "Geek Squad employees have been working as FBI informants for more than a decade, newly released documents show, revealing a much closer relationship between the two organizations than formerly reported. While we\u2019d previously known some of the Best Buy workers alerted law enforcement whenever they found illegal material like child pornography on customers\u2019 hard drives, the new documents show that the FBI met with the Geek Squad team at least as early as 2008 and apparently viewed some workers as paid informants. The Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the documents last year and released them on Tuesday. The Bureau refused to confirm or deny if it has similar relationships with other electronics repair companies.  The documents indicate Geek Squad technicians only flagged federal agents when they found child pornography on a client\u2019s computer, so it\u2019s hard to be too upset. Nevertheless, it raises concerning questions about potential violations of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.  Seeking to calm fears, a Best Buy spokesperson told HuffPost in an emailed statement that their technicians do not actively search for such content and only discover it inadvertently. But in at least one instance, that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. Per the EFF, an illicit image found on the hard drive of Mark Rettenmaier, a California doctor who dropped off his computer at a Best Buy in 2011, was stored on unallocated space on the disk that  typically requires forensic software to find.  Rettenmaier was tried in 2017 on felony child pornography charges, but the case was thrown out after U.S. District Judge Cormac Carney ruled the FBI warrant that allowed the search of Rettenmaier\u2019s home \u2015 a warrant granted based on the image found by Geek Squad \u2015 was obtained via  false and misleading statements.   EFF documents show this wasn\u2019t a one-off case, and that the FBI handled numerous incidents in similar fashion after being alerted by Geek Squad technicians at the company\u2019s repair facility in Kentucky. (The company\u2019s Kentucky Geek Squad City facility handles more serious repairs, including work like data recovery that could require them to sift through a customer\u2019s data.) Records uncovered as a result of the Rettenmaier case show the Bureau had  eight FBI informants at Geek Squad City  from 2007-2012, and that some Geek Squad employees were paid between $500 and $1,000 for their help. At least one Geek Squad technician attempted to give the money back and was rebuffed. In an emailed statement to HuffPost, Best Buy sought to temper concerns about possibly illegal searches, saying the company has both a moral and, in some cases, legal obligation to alert authorities when employees find child pornography \u2015 as it does  nearly 100 times a year.  Customers are also made aware of the policy in writing prior to Geek Squad beginning any repair.  As a company, we have not sought or received training from law enforcement in how to search for child pornography,  the company said.  Our policies prohibit employees from doing anything other than what is necessary to solve the customer\u2019s problem. In the wake of these allegations, we have redoubled our efforts to train employees on what to do \u2014 and not do \u2014 in these circumstances.   We have learned that four employees may have received payment after turning over alleged child pornography to the FBI,  the company continued.  Any decision to accept payment was in very poor judgement and inconsistent with our training and policies. Three of these employees are no longer with the company and the fourth has been reprimanded and reassigned.  "

I hope he rots in hell,  Moore, 18, said of Nassar on NBC News\u2019  Today  show on Tuesday.  Nassar has been accused of abusing over 260 young girls and women during decades as team doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University. He\u2019s now serving three concurrent sentences of up to 175 years on child sexual abuse and child pornography charges. Moore became the first male to accuse Nassar in a federal lawsuit filed last week alleging the former doctor molested him in 2016. Moore, now a freshman at the University of Michigan, said Nassar abused him under the guise of treatment for a shoulder injury when he was 16 years old.  I wasn\u2019t a dumb kid, I knew kind of what medical practices were and that one was out of the ordinary,  Moore said Tuesday.  Coming out of the treatment, I felt very uncomfortable.   Moore said he  kind of freaked out  when abuse allegations against Nassar became public, and he couldn\u2019t find an explanation for the treatment he received.  Moore\u2019s sister, who also has accused Nassar of abusing her, testified during a January sentencing hearing for the doctor in which she mentioned her brother had been victimized. Both siblings are gymnasts.  My whole family was fooled by you, but I know now who you really are,  Kamerin Moore told the serial predator. Jacob Moore said his entire family has been affected by Nassar\u2019s abuse.  Me and my sister shouldn\u2019t be able to relate over the fact that we\u2019ve both been abused,  he said.  That\u2019s just really sickening to me, that he would violate our trust like that \u2026 the things that he did were just awful.   President Donald Trump recently signed a bill that aims to protect amateur athletes from sexual assault in the wake of the Nassar scandal. In January, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette (R) announced that his office will conduct an  independent, thorough, transparent and prompt  investigation into MSU and its handling of the Nassar case. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos also has said the Department of Education will investigate how MSU handled the Nassar allegations. "

            "text": "In the days after three UCLA men\u2019s basketball players were arrested in China for allegedly shoplifting during a November visit, emails and letters poured in to university Chancellor Gene Block from angry fans, alumni and people with no connection to the school at all. There were hundreds and hundreds of messages, some written with perfect grammar and sober typefaces, others screeching and incoherent and laid out in Comic Sans. One author, a self-identified former UCLA crew letterman, somberly informed the chancellor that he was enclosing his old varsity sweater.  The three players \u2015 LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill \u2015 are black. Was the furious reaction about race? Not at all, said one correspondent, a little unconvincingly:  My decision is not based on the color of the skin of these thieves. Of my six grandchildren four are biracial.  Very much so, said another:  Don\u2019t surprise me you LOOK LIKE A FUDGPACKING FAGGOT !@ YOU SHOULD BE SO PROUD, 3 MONKEYS GETTING FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE RIDE AND EMBARRASS YO SCHOOL BY ACTING LIKE THE NIGGERS THEY APPARENTLY ARE !   And on and on they went, the emails nearly universal in their disdain for the athletes. Many of them were clearly spurred on by the involvement of President Donald Trump, who was just then initiating a feud with LaVar Ball, father of LiAngelo. HuffPost obtained the emails via a public records request, and in them the whole modern American backlash is on display. Expressions of lofty disapproval, bloodthirsty formalism, coded racism, frank racism \u2014 hey, hey, the gang\u2019s all here.  They have embarrassed their country as well as their race,  read one note.  They put shame on UCLA, their race and our country,  read another.  3 JERKS \u2014 DISGRACED THE COLLEGE \u2014 OUR COUNTRY AND THEIR RACE!  read a third, this one a handwritten letter. The full collection of emails and letters, all 637 pages, appears at the bottom of this post. First, some background: Ball, Riley and Hill, all freshmen, were arrested on Nov. 7 during the UCLA team\u2019s early-season trip to China to play Georgia Tech. The players, according to Chinese authorities and later by their own admissions, had stolen sunglasses and other merchandise from three department stores in Hangzhou.  On Nov. 15, Block and UCLA suspended the players indefinitely. Ball has since left the program to play professionally overseas. Hill and Riley are serving one-season suspensions.  The arrests became a national story in part because of Trump, who claimed credit for helping the players avoid a possible 10-year prison sentence in China. Some of the emails sent to Block took their cues from Trump\u2019s version of events.  Never again should anyone be allowed to commit a crime where President Trump has to come to UCLA\u2019s rescue. It is absolutely disgusting,  one correspondent wrote.  The man who probably stands against just about everything the UCLA community defends comes to the rescue of people who unfortunately are associated with UCLA.  ESPN has since reported that UCLA officials had resolved the issue with Chinese authorities before they heard from Trump or White House Chief of Staff John Kelly.  It was a simple case of minor theft, but from the wailing of the emails you might have thought the players had rampaged through the Forbidden City. Nothing short of the total annihilation of the young men\u2019s academic and professional lives would suffice in the eyes of many of the emailers. The players deserved the full force of American (and perhaps even Chinese) law for having swiped and ultimately returned a few pairs of sunglasses and other merchandise. One emailer told Block to  recommend that they not be rewarded with any professional contracts.  Time and again, emailers returned to the theme that the players were  entitled  athletes who didn\u2019t truly belong in college, especially not one as prestigious as UCLA. This racist exceptionalism \u2015 the idea that black men can only earn their way into college through athletic talent \u2015 flows in part from the reality of the school\u2019s population. Black men make up only about 3 percent of the male student body at UCLA, and a majority of them are athletes. As a viral video produced by students noted, the university has had more national sports championships in its history than it had black male freshmen in 2013\u2019s enrollment class.   In the emails, the usual racial code words were frequently deployed. The athletes were called some variation of  entitled  or  spoiled  nearly 50 times.  Stupid,   arrogant  and  above the law  also appeared regularly. There were at least 18 uses of  thug,  as in  entitled millionaire thugs,  in 14 separate emails. The players were also labeled  ingrates,   fucking embarrassing morons,   miscreant prima donnas  and  reprobates.  More than a dozen times, emailers explicitly referenced their own status as  taxpayers,  as if to suggest (in one writer\u2019s view) that they were tired of  subsidizing  athletes like Ball, Riley and Hill. And sometimes, the emailers dispensed with the racial coding altogether. One subject line:  Black Basketball Thieves.  Another message declared that what the players did was  Super-Idiocy!  It went on:  And you\u2019re going to let these morons earn a college degree at UCLA? Looks like they fulfill the stereotype of a \u2018simpleton black athlete.\u2019  The batch of emails included one that seemed to link the players to Michael Brown, the teenager shot and killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014.  It\u2019s when people like them get away with stealing from shops that people like [redacted] feel just as entitled to do the same in Missouri.   In the documents provided to HuffPost, UCLA appears to have redacted the players\u2019 names and any specific identification of them, as a way of formally protecting their identities. But you don\u2019t need a decoder ring to figure out what these passages are trying to say (sic throughout): UCLA must send a strong message on what it expects from such role models \u2015 let\u2019s not lie to ourselves, that\u2019s what they are to millions of young [redacted] males. It\u2019s when people like them get away with stealing from shops that people like [redacted] feel just as entitled to do the same in Missouri. Then he gets angry when someone tries to stop him, and he charges at the cop \u2015 and gets shot. It all starts when responsible institutions like UCLA give up on their responsibilities. Expel the thugs! Stealing designer sunglasses from Louis Vuitton in China while our president Trump is visiting is NOT who we are as a nation, but it is definitely who they are, a bunch of knuckleheads, lowlifes, thugs, and [redacted] with attitude. Why would you ever let trash like that out of the country?? It aint no big deal! No other country in the world would take the crap that we do from a minority 13% of a population for the majority of crime and other A-Z Any other minority in the US seem to be able to make it along with a moral compass. Not to excuse slavery but for decade\u2019s now [redacted] that wants to half way follow the program will make it. Its time to not hear any more excuses and crutching! These three should not get a pass, just because of the color of their skin. If they are attending your university on scholarships I strongly suggest they loose them. They can turn to their hero Colin Kaepernick, GQ\u2019s Citizen of the Year for help. What they did was not just stupid, it was ghetto and criminal, and we have no doubt that if there is another LA riot that they will be looting and vandalizing with their brothers. Congratulations for continuing to show China what American atheltes exist in this country. To some emailers, it was clear that the three players were experienced criminals ... I can only assume they have never been held accountable because they can shoot a ball into a basket. For these athletes to steal with the comfort level displayed showed they clearly had done this before. Pampered puss ants who probably let their trouser snakes out on campus screwing anything they see! FUCK EM!! ... and that they weren\u2019t good enough students to be at UCLA in the first place: Two of the fellows could hardly speak english. And did you notice that your student athletes had trouble reading their prepared statements? Shame on UCLA. How did these students get into UCLA in the first place? I bet it probably wasn\u2019t scholastics. \u2026 Dumber than a 2nd coat of paint! I am embarrassed when your student athletics, like your arrested basketball players and even last year\u2019s player [redacted] give interviews and use the word  ain\u2019t  . Children at age four learn that  ain\u2019t  is not proper grammar and unacceptable. This example simply proves you have no regard for even teaching you student-athletics basic English grammar. Stop the nonsense. It is an embarrassment to our country and your so called  education system  (what in the world are you teaching them anyway?) to have such reprobates representing us in foreign countries.  For too long California taxpayers have been subsidizing free education for questionable athletes/students. ... There needs to be more vetting of these student athletes, background checks, and general review of their understanding of civics and ethics, before California Taxpayers continue to subsidize these people. At a minimum, remove them from the basketball team. Of course this really means remove them from UCLA as they have no other use to be there since they can\u2019t play basketball. I\u2019m sick of paying for a full SCHOLARSHIP for future wifebeater/ drug dealing, criminal scum who get away with stuff that have a normal person in jail for 20 years, but they are  Great ballplayers , so they get to skate free.  Some even suggested the players were indicative of everything wrong with American culture by comparing them to Harvey Weinstein and other famous people implicated in sexual harassment and assault cases: [T]hey are toxic to the school and the sport just like serial sex predator Harvey Weinstein who is now a Hollywood pariah  UCLA cannot stand by and turn a blind eye to this disgrace...it is akin to the many in the entertainment industry whom allowed Harvey Weinstein and his ilk to victimize individuals in the name of money and fame. \u2026  I must insist - no, demand - that these disgraceful, criminal thugs be permanently expelled from UCLA for their heinous behavior and criminal acts. I\u2019m particularly troubled by what appears to be the emerging excuse \u2013 that they\u2019re young men, who made a very foolish mistake. To me, that\u2019s a bit like Kevin Spacey coming out as gay when he\u2019s charged with sexual misconduct. Look at the news; Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and Louis C.K. The time to say enough is enough is now. For UCLA, if these young men are allowed to continue to be students there, at a time when entitlement is under such scrutiny because of the misdeeds in Washington, in Hollywood, news agencies, workplaces, academia and homes throughout the country, giving these players a pass adds insult to injury. Our moral and ethical scales are calibrated today to benefit the powerful over the ordinary. If they stay on campus, it may appear that UCLA is putting a thumb on the scale promoting star power at a time when we are at a moral crossroads. And some who emailed Block said that he and UCLA should have left the players in China to face legal proceedings and potential jail time there: I find it shameful that our President brought the thieving basketball players home. Hopefully they will go to jail in China. They rightfully deserved to be tried and punished under Chinese law. They deserve to be in a Chinese prison. Our country now owes a Communist country a favor. This is serious. This is one of the few times we have disagreed with the actions of the President. In our opinion, the young men should have received Chinese legal proceedings and suffered the consequences. Like a bubble gum chewer in China they should have been left to face a bamboo whip. Only a handful of the emails sent to Block suggested that the appropriate punishment for the petty crimes the players committed in China wasn\u2019t to ruin their entire lives.   Chancellor Block,  one person wrote,  Please do not give up on these young UCLA men. Stick by them & help them grow.  "

That\u2019s the gist of what philanthropist Melinda Gates says in an op-ed published Monday in Quartz, in which she announced that she and her husband, Bill Gates, are pledging $170 million to help empower women economically around the world. The money, from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, will be spent over four years  to help women exercise their economic power,  Melinda Gates wrote. She noted that research shows economic power is the  most promising entry points for gender equality.    Simply put when money flows into the hands of women who have the authority to use it, everything changes,  she wrote. Gates broke down how women\u2019s economic empowerment is key to gender equality, saying families benefit when women control household finances.   Research shows ... that women are much more likely than men to buy things that set their families on a pathway out of poverty, like nutritious food, health care, and education,  Gates wrote.  Additionally, Gates noted, when women have economic power, communities begin to rethink the roles women play in society.   Women acting on their own can do what all the philanthropic organizations in the world can never accomplish: change the unwritten rule that women are lesser than men,  she wrote.  Our role, as we see it, is to make targeted investments that give women the opportunity to write new rules.  According to the op-ed, the donation will fund a three-pronged approach to economically empowering women: First, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will support and organize female farmers so they can sell their products at competitive prices; Second, the foundation will work in eight countries, including India, Pakistan and Tanzania, to promote women using digital bank accounts; And lastly, the foundation will facilitate self-help groups allowing women and girls share information about  everything from launching a small business to raising healthy children.

All three women made herstory in different industries: Earhart was the first female aviator to fly across the Atlantic Ocean; Mexican artist Kahlo was known for her unique painting style and feminist activism; and Johnson, who was highlighted in the 2016 film  Hidden Figures,  broke boundaries for black women in mathematics and calculated dozens of trajectories for NASA, including the 1969 Apollo 11 flight to the moon.  The dolls, which are part of Mattel\u2019s new series called  Inspiring Women,  will be mass produced and sold in stores. The toy company does not have an exact date for when they will hit shelves, but said each will come with educational information about the woman who inspired it.   As a brand that inspires the limitless potential in girls, Barbie will be honoring its largest line up of role models timed to International Women\u2019s Day, because we know that you can\u2019t be what you can\u2019t see,  Lisa McKnight, the senior vice president and general manager of Barbie, said Tuesday in a press release.  Girls have always been able to play out different roles and careers with Barbie and we are thrilled to shine a light on real life role models to remind them that they can be anything.  Johnson, 99, worked closely with Mattel to create her doll and ensure it looked as much like her as possible.  Ahead of International Women\u2019s Day on Thursday, Barbie\u2019s  Shero  line is also honoring 14 modern-day role models from around the world. These dolls celebrating women who have recently broken boundaries in their fields aren\u2019t meant to be sold, but some particularly popular ones have ended up in stores before.   The 14 new women Barbie is celebrating with its Shero line includes Olympic snowboarder Chloe Kim,  Wonder Woman  director Patty Jenkins and Australian wildlife conservationist Bindi Irwin. The line already honors women including director Ava DuVernay, actress Emmy Rossum, ballerina Misty Copeland and Olympic gymnast Gabby Douglas.

The one-minute video aired during the 90th Academy Awards, which took place in Los Angeles on Sunday night. The ad, which was the platform\u2019s first-ever Oscars commercial, was shot in black and white and promotes diverse representation and women\u2019s empowerment.  The ad features queer poet Denice Frohman performing a spoken-word poem as the faces of strong and influential women flash across the screen. Director Ava DuVernay, actress Issa Rae, Oracle executive Jennifer Renaud and Twitter\u2019s senior director of marketing and communications, Nola Weinstein, all appear in the video.   I heard a woman becomes herself the first time she speaks without permission,  Frohman begins her poem.  Then every word out her mouth, a riot. Say beautiful and point to the map of your body. Say brave and wear your skin like a gown.  Twitter announced the ad on its platform, writing:  We stand with women around the world to make their voices heard and their presence known. To bring them front and center, today and every day.   Many Twitter users thought the ad was somewhat hypocritical, however, because the platform has done little to curb any type of online harassment, especially that against women. According to a 2015 study, 88 percent of social media harassment occurs on Twitter. While there are many types of harassers online, much of the vitriol has historically targeted women. It often includes body-shaming comments, sexist language and even rape and death threats. Although Twitter has taken steps recently to prevent online harassment and bullying, many users still believe more needs to be done. While many people applauded the powerful ad, dozens of women tweeted their disappointment on Sunday night.   #HereWeAre, still watching as Twitter does little to nothing about the rampant misogyny & racism that infects this space,  feminist author Jessica Valenti tweeted.  Jewish activist and feminist Rebeccs Krevat pointed out that the ad was very powerful, but problematic.  That @Twitter commercial was powerful, but also feels odd considering that I spent this past weekend being harassed by misogynist fat-shaming trolls, only [to] be told that the Tweets didn\u2019t violate their standards,  she wrote.  Do better, Twitter, where it matters.  Feminist organization and documentary film  Miss Representation  also criticized the ad, tweeting:  It\u2019s amazing to see all these amazing women in this @Twitter ad, but if the platform really wants to encourage women\u2019s voices they need to update their Safety Guidelines.

            "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former drug company executive Martin Shkreli may have to give up a Picasso and a one-of-a-kind Wu-Tang Clan album, after a U.S. judge on Monday ordered him to forfeit $7.36 million following his conviction of defrauding investors. U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto in Brooklyn said the assets Shkreli could forfeit to satisfy the judgment also include $5 million in a brokerage account and his stake in Vyera Pharmaceuticals, one of the drug companies he founded. Shkreli is scheduled to be sentenced for securities fraud on Friday. A lawyer for Shkreli could not immediately be reached for comment on the judge\u2019s order. Shkreli, 34, has been in jail since September, when Matsumoto revoked his bail after he offered a $5,000 bounty for a strand of Hillary Clinton\u2019s hair in a Facebook post. Shkreli became notorious as the Pharma Bro  when he raised the price of anti-parasitic drug Daraprim by over 5,000 percent in 2015 while he was chief executive officer of Turing Pharmaceuticals. Turing is now Vyera. In December 2015, Shkreli told Bloomberg Businessweek that he had bought the Wu-Tang Clan\u2019s Once Upon a Time in Shaolin  when the hip-hop group auctioned the sole copy of the album to the highest bidder. Bloomberg reported that he paid $2 million for it. Shkreli has also boasted of owning a Picasso painting. A jury found Shkreli guilty last August of securities fraud charges unrelated to Daraprim. They determined that he lied to investors about the performance of two hedge funds he ran, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare. He also was found guilty of conspiring to manipulate the stock price of another drug company he founded, Retrophin Inc (RTRX.O). Shkreli\u2019s lawyers have asked that he be sentenced to 12 to 18 months in prison. They argued in a court filing that a lenient sentence is warranted partly because the investors eventually came out ahead when Shkreli paid them in stock and cash from Retrophin. Matsumoto has already ruled that when Shkreli is sentenced, he will be held responsible for $10.4 million in losses, including all of the money his investors entrusted to his hedge funds. She said that regardless of the investors\u2019 ultimate gains, Shkreli got their money in the first place through fraud. Although the $10.4 million loss will result in a higher recommended sentence under federal guidelines, Matsumoto is not required to follow those guidelines. "

ESPN reported Friday that the three University of California, Los Angeles basketball players, who were allegedly caught shoplifting in China, were already scheduled to return home by the time Chief of Staff John Kelly said the White House was getting involved. LiAngelo Ball, Jalen Hill and Cody Riley were in China for a game at the time of their arrests. To recreate a timeline of the arrests, ESPN\u2019s reporters spent three months conducting interviews with sources close to the team who were in China at the time of the incident.  The situation was already resolved by the time we heard about Trump\u2019s involvement,  one source told ESPN.  That\u2019s not to take away from the fact that he got involved, but the players already had their passports back and their flights booked to go home Tuesday night when Gen. Kelly called the players.  Earlier reports claimed the basketball players were released after Trump spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump reportedly brought the issue up with Xi at a dinner during a visit to Beijing in November. The incident sparked a feud between Trump and LiAngelo Ball\u2019s father, LaVar Ball. In an interview with CNN, Lavar said he\u2019d rather thank Xi than Trump. He also expressed skepticism that Trump orchestrated his son\u2019s release.  Did he help the boys get out?

            "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Roger Bannister, who has died aged 88, will live forever in the annals of athletics history as the first man to run a mile in under four minutes. A statement from his family on Sunday said:  Sir Roger Bannister, died peacefully in Oxford on 3 March, aged 88, surrounded by his family who were as loved by him, as he was loved by them. ... He banked his treasure in the hearts of his friends.  British Prime Minister Theresa May led the tributes to the former athlete, who later became one of Europe\u2019s leading neurologists and was made a knight.  Sir Roger Bannister was a great British sporting icon whose achievements were an inspiration to us all. He will be greatly missed,  she said on Twitter. The record-breaking run was on the Oxford University track during a local athletics meeting with only a few spectators witnessing the Englishman\u2019s destruction of the myth that no human being could run so fast. Bannister made headlines around the world at the age of 25. His achievement opened the physical and psychological door for many other milers who have since beaten his time of three minutes 59.4 seconds. Roger Gilbert Bannister, born in Harrow, a London suburb, on March 23, 1929, was a shy, gangling medical student who preferred to be an oarsman rather than a runner. In 1946, when he went to Oxford, his great ambition was to row against Cambridge in the annual boat race on the Thames. But Bannister, who stood 1.8 meters tall and weighed only 68 kilograms, was told he was too light to make a first-rate oarsman. So he turned to running and his new ambition became to win the 1,500 meters at the Olympic Games in Helsinki in 1952. Bannister started a five-year build-up and in 1947 at the age of 17 at Oxford ran his first mile race, finishing second in a time of just over five minutes. Later that year he won the mile for Oxford against Cambridge in an athletics meeting. The world record was gradually being whittled down and a number of athletes were considered capable of crashing the four-minute barrier. "

            "text": "However much you tip your Uber driver, it\u2019s probably not enough. And however much Uber pays its drivers, it\u2019s almost definitely not enough, either. Those are two big takeaways from a new working paper by a group of researchers led by Stephen Zoepf, executive director of the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford University and a researcher at the MIT Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, which found that a substantial percentage of drivers for ride-hailing companies probably earn less than they think they do, though their wages are padded thanks to per-mile tax deductions. As a working paper, it\u2019s important to note the figures haven\u2019t been peer-reviewed and are subject to change. Nevertheless, it offers interesting insight into an industry where driver pay has been the subject of much scrutiny. Unlike previous economic analyses that report drivers\u2019 gross profits without factoring in operational costs, the MIT paper takes into account how much drivers spend on things like insurance, maintenance, repairs, fuel and the car\u2019s depreciation in value, using data from Edmunds, Kelley Blue Book and the Environmental Protection Agency.  Once those costs are accounted for, the working paper found, 74 percent of ride-hailing drivers make less than the minimum wage in their states, and 30 percent of drivers actually lose money for every mile they drive. In the survey of 1,121 drivers, the median driver earned $0.59 per mile and paid out $0.30 per mile in vehicle costs, leading to a median hourly profit of $3.37.  Notably, a choice few drivers with the most efficient vehicles and running the most profitable routes were able to turn out revenue of $1.50 per mile. Zoepf told HuffPost the Toyota Prius, a gas/electric hybrid, was drivers\u2019 vehicle of choice by a factor of two. More than 80 percent of the drivers surveyed said they work less than 40 hours per week. It isn\u2019t all bad news for drivers, however. The paper found nearly half of all drivers can declare a loss for tax purposes at the federal tax deduction rate of roughly $0.54 per mile. Per the researchers, that drastically decreases the amount of taxable income drivers need to report, to the extent that an estimated 74 percent of driver profit \u2015 representing billions of dollars \u2015 is going untaxed.  At an average of $661/month in net profit per driver and with hundreds of thousands of drivers in the U.S. alone, the standard mileage deduction facilitates billions of dollars of untaxed income, and hundreds of millions of unrealized tax revenue,  the paper notes.  This untaxed profit represents a social subsidy for the ride-hailing business model.  Lyft didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment from HuffPost, but a spokesman for Uber vigorously disputed the paper\u2019s methodology and findings.  While the paper is certainly attention grabbing, its methodology and findings are deeply flawed,  the spokesman said.  We\u2019ve reached out to the paper\u2019s authors to share our concerns and suggest ways we might work together to refine their approach.  Zoepf didn\u2019t immediately respond to followup questions about his methodology. Compared to other studies that used different methodology, the MIT paper is indeed an outlier. A National Bureau of Economic Research study in November 2016 found drivers in six major metropolitan areas earned around $18 an hour, not taking into account hourly costs varying from $2.94 to $6.46 per hour depending on the hours they worked and the vehicle they drove. The paper also received some scrutiny from Harry Campbell, founder of The Rideshare Guy, an industry blog. Campbell\u2019s 2017 Reader Survey provided the hard data the researchers used for their paper. Using the same data, Campbell came up with an average hourly rate of around $16 an hour, not taking drivers\u2019 operational costs into account. But, he said, even if MIT\u2019s methodology needs to be tweaked \u2015 which is possible, since it\u2019s a working paper \u2015  its fundamental finding is spot on: Drivers aren\u2019t making enough money.   Many drivers are doing this job part time and really only looking to make a few hundred bucks a week,  Campbell said,  but figuring out how much they are actually earning can be quite challenging.   I think that\u2019s why we see such high turnover, and the No. 1 reason we hear from drivers as to why they\u2019re quitting is because of lower-than-expected earnings.  "

The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in California but announced Friday, accuses the committee of bungling its response to sexual abuse allegations against Nassar, who is now serving a long prison term for sex crimes.   After all this time, they remain unwilling to conduct a full investigation, and without a solid understanding of how this happened, it is delusional to think sufficient changes can be implemented,  Raisman said in a statement, according to NBC.  I refuse to wait any longer for these organizations to do the right thing. It is my hope that the legal process will hold them accountable and enable the change that is so desperately needed.  A USA Gymnastics trainer was sometimes present during treatment sessions where Nassar abused young athletes at the Karolyi Ranch, Raisman alleges in the suit, according to NBC News.  Raisman, in recent interviews, has accused the USOC of ignoring allegations against Nassar and threatening her not to tell how he molested her under the guise of treatment.  I was told [by USA Gymnastics] to be quiet,  Raisman told ESPN in January.  And I think that when somebody in high power is telling you to be quiet, right when they realized you are abused, I think that that is a threat. USA Gymnastics just said, \u2018We\u2019re handling this. We got this. Like, stop asking us questions.\u2019  Raisman, a gold medalist who competed at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, was among more than 100 women who alleged Nassar sexually abused them. He pleaded guilty to child pornography and sexual assault charges and was sentenced to lengthy prison terms.  The USOC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The group\u2019s CEO, Scott Blackmun, resigned on Wednesday after a cancer diagnosis.  Under his leadership, USOC has focused nearly all its efforts on money and medals while the safety of our athletes has taken a back seat,  attorney John Manly, who represents many of Nassar\u2019s victims, including Raisman, said in a statement.

Jacob Moore, a former member of the U.S. junior team and now a gymnast at University of Michigan, said in a federal lawsuit filed Wednesday in Michigan that Nassar molested him in 2016, when he was 16 years old, according to multiple news outlets. The suit was first reported by International Gymnast magazine on Thursday. Moore says in his lawsuit that Nassar applied  acupuncture in his pubic area and in and around his genitalia  and  pulled down Moore\u2019s pants, exposing his genitalia  to a young female gymnast also present in the room. More than 100 women, including Olympic champion gymnasts, have alleged Nassar sexually abused them under the guise of treatment for decades, but Moore is the first male to come forward. Nassar pleaded guilty to child pornography and sexual assault charges in recent months and was sentenced to lengthy prison terms.  Moore\u2019s older sister Kamerin said Nassar also abused her. Kamerin Moore mentioned her brother during Nassar\u2019s sentencing hearing this year, recalling that she  watched him frantically search the Internet, trying to find some proof that the chi in his shoulder is somehow connected to his genitals.  The siblings joined a federal lawsuit against Nassar, USA Gymnastics and Michigan State. The filing says  there is no known medical connection between shoulder pain which can be treated through acupuncture in the area of a male\u2019s genitalia.  Moore\u2019s lawsuit adds to the litigation involving Nassar. The Olympic gold medalist Aly Raisman filed suit against the U.S. Olympic Committee this week for failing to take action to prevent the abuse.  The USOC\u2019s Scott Blackmun stepped down as CEO this week amid investigations into whether the organization\u2019s officials knew about the allegations and attempted a cover-up.  CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misidentified where Jacob Moore is a gymnast. It is the University of Michigan, not Michigan State University. "

The declaration prompted a funny response on Wednesday from Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich. At an MIT Sports Analytics Conference in Boston, Obama said that as a player he would seek out the five-time champion Spurs because they satisfy his checklist for ideal organizations.  They\u2019re smart, they\u2019re well-run, they\u2019re focused on team,  he said (listen in the sound clip below).

Pizza Hut\u2019s new status as sponsor was announced just one day after the league and Papa John\u2019s released a joint statement saying the two had parted ways. Pizza Hut and the NFL reached a multiyear agreement that will offer  exclusive marketing rights and designations that will connect the brand with the NFL and its teams, players, events, [and] partners,  the league said Wednesday. Papa John\u2019s has had a rocky few months. Founder John Schnatter, who supported Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, expressed his displeasure in November about NFL players taking a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality and systemic racial injustice. Schnatter claimed the league\u2019s handling of the protests was responsible for Papa John\u2019s softening sales. That commentary resulted in bad publicity and still more poor sales for Papa John\u2019s, ultimately leading to Schnatter\u2019s resignation as CEO toward the end of last year. He is still the company\u2019s chairman. Twitter users (and many members of the NFL) have been particularly saucy about Wednesday\u2019s news: Now... who\u2019s hungry? "

            "text": "Scott Blackmun is stepping down from his post as CEO of the U.S. Olympic Committee after eight years, the organization said Wednesday in a statement. The decision comes while Team USA\u2019s governing body continues to face sharp questions over patterns of sexual abuse uncovered throughout the U.S. Olympic program.  USOC said the move was made out of consideration for Blackmun\u2019s health. He is currently being treated for prostate cancer.  Given Scott\u2019s current health situation, we have mutually agreed it is in the best interest of both Scott and the USOC that we identify new leadership so that we can immediately address the urgent initiatives ahead of us,  USOC Chairman Larry Probst said in a statement provided to HuffPost. Current board member Susanne Lyons will oversee day-to-day operations while a search is conducted for Blackmun\u2019s replacement. The group is continuing to evaluate what steps it can take to prevent abuse of its athletes and said it intends to form an advisory committee of abuse survivors and advocates.  Observers have been particularly critical of the USOC\u2019s relationship with former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar, who was handed a prison sentence of at least 40 years in January for serial sexual misconduct. In the wake of the scandal, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) called for Blackmun\u2019s resignation. Other Olympic groups, including USA Swimming, had also called for him and other USOC leaders to step down.  The USOC is at a critical point in its history,  Probst said.  The important work that Scott started needs to continue and will require especially vigorous attention in light of Larry Nassar\u2019s decades-long abuse of athletes affiliated with USA Gymnastics. We will be working with key stakeholders to help identify a permanent successor to Scott. In the meantime, I am confident that Susanne is the right person to help us navigate this critical transition period.  Blackmun had earned praise for his efforts to repair relations between the USOC and the International Olympic Committee.  Serving the USOC and its many stakeholders and working with our board, our professional staff and many others who support the Olympic and Paralympic movements has not only been immensely rewarding, it has been an honor and the highlight of my professional life,  Blackmun said in a statement. California attorney Robert Allard, who represents USA Swimming abuse survivors, said in a statement Wednesday that Blackmum\u2019s departure would be good for the USOC.  Scott Blackmun refused to protect athletes from predator coaches even though he knew for decades that sexual abuse was a major problem with USOC National Governing Bodies,  Allard said.  His legacy, along with USA Swimming CEO Chuck Wielgus, will be that of a sexual abuse enabler. Moving forward, the culture that allowed sexual abuse to fester and thrive under Blackmun must be destroyed. We will not rest until all of those that have been part of the childhood sexual abuse problem for decades are removed from the USOC and its National Governing Bodies. Only then will young athletes truly be safe. With Blackmun now gone, it is imperative that the USOC put someone in charge who places the safety and welfare of athletes as its top priority.  "

Papa John\u2019s CEO Steve Ritchie, who took over from founder John Schnatter on Jan. 1, told investors the company will shift its marketing from the whole NFL and instead focus on specific teams and players, according to Business Insider. In addition, Ritchie said, the company will emphasize digital sales and work toward changing the perception that its pizza is  too expensive.  Although Papa John\u2019s has been the official pizza of the NFL since 2010, the chain reported that North American sales dropped nearly 4 percent during the last three months of 2017 \u2015 which, if you need a reminder, was football season. Executives blamed the sales slump on  negative consumer sentiment.  And Schnatter may have been responsible for that. In November, he faced backlash after claiming that NFL players\u2019 kneeling protests were costing Papa John\u2019s money.  Schnatter put the blame on NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, saying the NFL hurt Papa John\u2019s shareholders  by not resolving the current debacle to the players\u2019 and owners\u2019 satisfaction.  Schnatter, who supported Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, told investors that Goodell should have stopped the players from exercising their right to free expression back in 2016. The player protests began when quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a knee in 2016 during the national anthem to protest racial injustice in America. Schnatter\u2019s remarks caused negative publicity for the company, and some NFL owners speculate Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who has a stake in more than 100 Papa John\u2019s locations, talked Schnatter into turning his attack on the league public, according to Pro Football Talk. As a result of poor sales, Schnatter stepped down as CEO at the beginning of the year, though he remains as chairman.  "

            "text": "Six months after acquiring Whole Foods, Amazon (AMZN) is working on reorganizing Whole Foods shelves by first adding Amazon private label products and, soon, it may add popular consumer packaged goods like Coca-Cola. Behind the scenes, this is causing internal debate and disagreements, Yahoo Finance has learned. When asked if Whole Foods will add  consumer packaged goods like Coca-Cola,  Whole Foods spokesperson Brooke Buchanan said,  As you know, we have really high-quality standards, and those products that you just mentioned don\u2019t meet those quality standards. If there were new products that actually do meet our quality standards, then there\u2019s always that consideration.  Amazon declined to comment. In June, Whole Foods CEO John Mackey called the marriage with Amazon,  love at first sight.  And the two appear to be in a happy union, with one big announcement after another: price cuts on staples; Amazon Echo devices debuting in stores; and recent free delivery on Whole Foods products for Prime members. But the honeymoon may be over as Amazon and Whole Foods butt heads over what to stock store shelves with. Would adding Coke sacrifice the healthy, organic image Whole Foods has long held dear? Whole Foods has been known for its strict rules on sourcing products, requiring foods  free of artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners, and hydrogenated fats,  according to its website. That rules out Coca-Cola, the household product with artificial preservatives in the secret recipe, and even its healthier diet version. Amazon\u2019s plan to change Whole Foods\u2019 shelves is a key effort of the e-commerce giant\u2019s initiative to make Whole Foods profitable. Whole Foods same-store sales had been falling for eight consecutive quarters before being bought by Amazon. After Amazon\u2019s takeover, Whole Foods reported a 4.4% increase in sales for the quarter ending Sept. 24, 2017 from a year earlier \u2014 the biggest in two years. While Whole Foods gained an almost cult-like following, it has also been criticized for its limited store offerings, even as retailers like Walmart and Costco have started to sell more organic produce. Whole Foods owns just a 4% share in the total U.S. grocery market, a far cry from Walmart\u2019s 25% and Kroger\u2019s 10%, according to a Susquehanna analyst note last June. Then Amazon came. As a consumer-centric company, Amazon is leveraging Whole Foods to satisfy customer needs. That has become more urgent after Amazon provides free delivery of Whole Foods groceries for Prime members, who have a large appetite for packaged goods like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo snacks.  Whole Foods has proved a specialty retailer focusing only on organic food can\u2019t scale and be profitable,  says Brittain Ladd, a retail and supply chain consultant.  Amazon doesn\u2019t want to maintain the status quo. They can\u2019t see people go elsewhere simply because these highly-popular products are not available in Whole Foods.  Amazon could add private label products as soon as March, but the plan of bringing in consumer-packaged goods still faces obstacles from Whole Foods, according to sources familiar with the matter.  If that does ever happen, it will upset a lot of team members and customers,  a longtime Whole Foods store employee in Austin told Yahoo Finance.  That\u2019s what makes Whole Foods Market different from our competitors.  But food makers have already started providing healthy alternatives of its products for the Whole Foods. Last year, Bloomberg reported PepsiCo\u2019s Frito-Lay developed organic Doritos marketed under the name  Simply,  which meet all the criteria needed to be sold in Whole Foods. Industry experts said Whole Foods will eventually benefit from larger store selections, since many packaged goods have higher margins and a strong customer base.  It\u2019s painful, but Whole Foods needs to be put out of the comfort zone,  Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail told Yahoo Finance.  There are retailers that can provide high-quality organic food while offer packaged goods, and Amazon is helping Whole Foods in that direction.

            "text": "The whistleblower who exposed Russia\u2019s Olympic doping scandal is firing back at a powerful oligarch who is financing a lawsuit against him in the United States, demanding that the businessman preserve documents that he believes may show Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s government is secretly behind the litigation. And in a letter addressed to Mikhail Prokhorov, the billionaire businessman who is also the owner of the Brooklyn Nets basketball team, the lawyer for whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov threatens a countersuit aimed at exposing the Russian government\u2019s efforts to harass and intimidate his client in the United States. The letter by lawyer Jim Walden, a copy of which was provided to Yahoo News, adds to the intrigue surrounding a lawsuit that was filed against Rodchenkov last week in a New York state court by three Russian biathletes who were stripped of their 2014 Olympic medals as a result of the whistleblower\u2019s allegations about Russian doping. The lawsuit accuses Rodchenkov, the former director of Russia\u2019s antidoping laboratory, of defaming the biathletes and  destroying their careers.  Letter To Mikhail Prokhorov Scott Balber, the New York lawyer for the Russian athletes, has acknowledged that Prokhorov is helping to finance the lawsuit along with unnamed others.  I am not at liberty to identify anyone else other than Mr. Prokhorov,  Balber said in an email Monday, when asked who else was bankrolling the lawsuit. Balber once represented Donald Trump in a $5 million lawsuit \u2014 filed in 2013 and later withdrawn \u2014 against comedian Bill Maher for likening Trump\u2019s hair to an orangutan\u2019s. He currently represents another Russian oligarch, Aras Agalarov, and his son Emin Agalarov \u2014 two key figures in the Trump-Russia investigation who helped arrange the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russian operatives at which Trump campaign officials were promised derogatory information about Hillary Clinton.  Mr. Balber\u2019s admission that unnamed \u2018others\u2019 are also financing this lawsuit is strange \u2014 raising the specter that the Kremlin itself might be acting through proxies here,  Walden said in a statement to Yahoo News.  Certainly, this could be problematic for all involved in this shady suit.  In his letter to Prokhorov, Walden asks that all documents relating to the litigation be preserved, including any communications between the Brooklyn Nets owner and  any current or former Russian government officials, Russian law enforcement officers, officers or agents of the FSB [Russia\u2019s domestic intelligence service] or representatives of the Russian Olympic Committee.  Asked for comment, Balber called Walden\u2019s letter  a publicity stunt  and said,  As far as I know, there is absolutely no Russian government role in the filing of the lawsuit. This appears to be complete fiction.  He added:  The sole purpose of this lawsuit is to clear the names of three hard-working, world-class Olympic athletes, and to obtain compensation for the economic loss they have suffered as a result of Mr. Rodchenkov\u2019s false and defamatory statements.  The legal sparring is the latest development in a complicated political and sporting saga that has been playing out since Rodchenkov fled Russia and went public with his account in 2016, describing what he portrayed as a vast and sophisticated scheme by Russia to provide banned drugs to the country\u2019s athletes to boost their performance in the Olympic Games and other international sporting competitions \u2014 and to cheat the systems meant to catch them. In numerous interviews and in the widely acclaimed Netflix documentary  Icarus,  Rodchenkov described how he worked with the FSB, the Russian spy agency formerly headed by Putin, and with Russia\u2019s sports ministry to oversee a system in which sealed urine samples of athletes were routinely swapped after testing, allowing athletes to take banned substances to avoid detection. After the Sochi Olympics, Rodchenkov was awarded a prestigious Order of Friendship medal by Putin. The allegations by Rodchenkov were confirmed by international investigators and led to the International Olympic Committee\u2019s decision to bar Russia from sending a delegation to this year\u2019s Winter Olympics in South Korea, although Russian athletes were allowed to participate as individuals. That decision was reaffirmed just this week by the Olympic Committee, which refused to let Russian athletes march under their own flag in the closing ceremony at the South Korea Olympics. Since fleeing to the United States, Rodchenkov, now in the federal witness protection program, has provided key evidence to international investigators and Justice Department officials about potential violations of federal law by the Russians. In doing so, he has become virtually public enemy No. 1 to Putin\u2019s government: Prosecutors in Russia have filed criminal charges against him, accusing him of drug trafficking, and Putin during his end of the year press conference last December suggested that Rodchenkov was being drugged and manipulated by U.S. intelligence agencies.  What are [U.S. intelligence agencies] doing with him there?  Putin said at the December press conference.  Are they giving him some kind of substances so that he says what\u2019s required?  Shortly after Putin\u2019s comments, Walden said he was warned by U.S. officials that Russian agents may be looking for Rodchenkov in the United States. Walden, a former federal prosecutor, said he is concerned that the lawsuit is in fact in furtherance of that effort \u2014 an attempt  to find him through judicial means.

Three days later, she tested positive for a banned substance at the Pyeongchang Winter Games. Sergeeva denied taking the drug that triggered the positive result. The video showing Sergeeva wearing a sweatshirt emblazoned with the words,  I don\u2019t do doping. I am ZASPORT,  a reference to the official clothing supplier to the Russian Olympic Committee, has since been deleted from Instagram, according to The Guardian. The clip was reportedly posted to Instagram on Feb. 15 by Russia-based videographer Roman Bibishev. ABC News said the video was produced last year to promote the clothing brand. Sergeeva was spotted in a similar shirt in Pyeongchang earlier this month. The Associated Press said she wore a white T-shirt with the words  I Don\u2019t Do Doping  under her racing suit during a training session. Sergeeva \u2014 who finished 12th in the two-woman bobsleigh event in Pyeongchang \u2014 tested positive for an angina medication with performance-enhancing properties on Feb. 18, the Russian bobsleigh federation announced on its Facebook page. She passed a drug test five days earlier. Sergeeva denied taking the drug. The federation\u2019s president, Alexander Zubkov, said the athlete had not been prescribed any medication. Sergeeva was the second Russian athlete to fail a doping test at the Pyeongchang Games. Alexander Krushelnitsky, an Olympic curler, was forced to return his bronze medal last week after testing positive for meldonium, a potential performance-enhancing drug.  The International Olympic Committee banned Russia from the 2018 Winter Games over its state-backed doping program, but allowed a group of athletes to compete under the Olympic flag.  The IOC said it considered lifting the suspension for Sunday\u2019s closing ceremony so OAR athletes could march under the Russian flag. In the end, however, the committee decided to keep the ban in place because of the two failed drug tests.  "

Team USA won a total of 23 medals in Pyeongchang, South Korea \u2015 nine gold, eight silver and six bronze medals among them. Twelve of the 23 medals were won by women \u2015 not including two that were achieved in mixed events (ice dancing and the team figure skating competition). When it came to the gold medals, five of the nine were won by women in history-making performances. Cross-country skiers Kikkan Randall and Jessica Diggins won gold in the sprint freestyle, winning a medal in the event for Team USA for the first time since 1976 (and its first gold, to boot). Seventeen-year-old snowboarding sensation Chloe Kim won gold in the halfpipe, becoming the youngest ever gold medalist in the history of the event. The women\u2019s hockey team won gold in the finals, beating longtime rival Canada and giving the team its first Olympic gold since the event debuted at the Winter Games in 1998.  Even when the women didn\u2019t win gold, they still made history. Women athletes won three of six silver medals and four of six bronze medals. Alpine skier Lindsey Vonn took bronze in the downhill event to become the oldest Olympic female alpine medalist at the age of 33. Team USA\u2019s female athletes also surpassed their male teammates in medal count. As the Washington Post noted, only alpine skier Mikaela Shiffrin, snowboarder Jamie Anderson and ice dancing siblings Alex and Maia Shibutani won two medals at the games.

            "text": "PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - The International Olympic Committee (IOC) dashed Russian athletes\u2019 hopes of marching behind their national flag at the Winter Games on Sunday, deciding against immediately lifting Russia\u2019s Olympic suspension after fresh doping violations. Russians have been competing as neutral athletes at the Games, their Olympic status suspended, as IOC punishment for years of drug scandals involving allegations that Russia ran a systematic, state-backed drug-cheating program. The IOC said two Russian doping violations during the Pyeongchang Games had marred an otherwise clean report card for the Russian delegation at the Games.  This was hugely disappointing and, in addition to other considerations, prevented the IOC from even considering lifting the suspension for the closing ceremony,  IOC President Thomas Bach said in presenting the recommendation to IOC members. Bach said Russia\u2019s Olympic status would be restored automatically once it was confirmed there were no other doping violations by Russian athletes at Pyeongchang. It does not require any further decision by the IOC.  That is an automatic decision,  he told reporters.  This is an objective condition ... and then the sanction is lifted.  The suspended Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) said it hoped to return to the Olympic family in the coming days.  We hope and really count on that in the next few days, the membership of the Russian Olympic Committee in the IOC will be completely restored,  it said in a statement.  In light of the situation, we consider that the restoration of the rights of the ROC and all Russian athletes will be the main result of the Olympic Games that are ending today.  Competition at the Winter Games concludes on Sunday and final drug testing results might not be known for several days or even weeks.  I\u2019m very disappointed,  said Elena Valbe, president of the Russian cross-country skiing federation.  Some athletes stayed behind later with the hope that they would be walking under the Russian flag. I\u2019ve heard athletes say that they were staying just because they wanted to walk with the flag and in our uniform.  Former Olympic ice hockey champion Igor Larionov told Reuters it would be hard for Russian players to stand on the podium under the Olympic flag if they won the ice hockey gold medal in their final against Germany later on Sunday.  Time needs to pass for the right to have the flag back, I think,  the Russian said.  It is difficult for me to understand how any figure skater, hockey player or skier can win gold and stand on the podium without their flag. It\u2019s sad. \u2018DROWNING MAN\u2019 Russia\u2019s Olympic delegation chief and its figure skating silver medalist, Evgenia Medvedeva, had made a last appeal to the IOC on Saturday for their suspension to be lifted, apologizing for the two doping violations during the Games. Medal-winning curler Alexander Krushelnitsky and bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva failed doping tests, angering a team that had been through extensive testing before and during the first days of Games competition without returning any positive results. The lawyer for Grigory Rodchenkov, the former Russian doping laboratory director who turned whistleblower and helped expose the drugs scandal, said  cooler heads  at the IOC had prevailed and stopped Russia\u2019s immediate Olympic return. Rodchenkov currently lives in hiding in the United States.  Thomas Bach was a drowning man, but finally cooler heads within the IOC threw him a life preserver,  Jim Walden said in a statement.  Yet, in the decision, the IOC had the gall to claim Russia \u2018respected\u2019 its decision on December 5th to institute the suspension. The acrimony caused by Bach\u2019s mismanagement should be his undoing,  Walden said. At the Games, the Russians have been unable to wear national uniforms or have their anthem played at medal presentations. Russian delegation chief Stanislav Pozdnyakov has said that the prospect of flying the flag at Sunday night\u2019s closing ceremony meant more to his athletes than winning medals. In December, the IOC had held out the prospect of lifting Russia\u2019s suspension for the closing ceremony, on the condition its athletes met a strict code of conduct, including compliance with anti-doping rules and observance of athlete neutrality.

Norway\u2019s Marit Bjoergen, who is now the most decorated Winter Olympian of all time, finished first to secure her 15th Olympic medal. Bjoergen entered the 2018 Games with 10 medals and recently broke the previous record of 13 medals held by Norwegian biathlete Ole Einar Bj\u00f8rndalen. Sunday\u2019s gold medal is her eighth of her Olympic career. Bjoergen\u2019s competitors finished almost two minutes behind her. In second, earning silver, was Krista Parmakoski of Finland, and in third, earning bronze, was Stina Nilsson of Sweden. "

Russia, competing as neutral athletes at Pyeongchang, scored in overtime through Kirill Kaprizov for a 4-3 victory in one of the most surprising finals in the history of the Olympic men\u2019s ice hockey tournament. Later, at the medal ceremony, the winning team sang the Russian anthem over the sound of the Olympic anthem at the hockey arena, despite being barred by Olympic authorities from having their flag raised or anthem played. With Germany\u2019s Patrick Reimer off for high sticking midway through the extra period, the Olympic Athletes from Russia went on a four-on-three man advantage and Kaprizov one-timed a pass from Nikita Gusev past German goaltender Danny aus den Birken. The OAR found themselves evenly matched by a German team that had surprised the hockey world by making it to their first Olympic final. The Germans won silver, their best finish ever in Olympic ice hockey. Both teams scored twice in a back-and-forth third period with Nikita Gusev knotting the game with a short-handed goal with less than a minute to go to force the overtime period. The Russians hit the ice hours after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided not to restore their delegation\u2019s Olympic status, which would have enabled them to march under their flag at the closing ceremony later on Sunday. [nL4N1QF015] As the OAR players received their gold medals on the ice, the Olympic flag was raised in place of the Russian flag and the Olympic anthem was played. But the players, arms around each other, sang the Russian anthem instead. Singing the Russian anthem on the field of play is a violation of the IOC\u2019s rules on neutrality, which were imposed on Russia as part of sanctions punishing the nation over systematic doping across many sports. On paper the final shouldn\u2019t have been a fair fight but the Germans skated evenly with the OAR. Loaded with top home-grown talent from Russia\u2019s Kontinental Hockey League, seen as the world\u2019s second-best league after the NHL, and led by ex-NHL all stars Pavel Datsyuk and Ilya Kovalchuk, the OAR finally edged past a team that had punched above its weight. Aside from Kaprizov with the game winner, Gusev was the other hero for the OAR, scoring two third-period goals and getting an assist to become the tournament\u2019s points leader.

South Korean Kim Bo-reum slipped into the channel created by Takagi to win the silver medal 0.12 seconds behind the Japanese as Schouten settled for bronze. Takagi, who won gold in the women\u2019s team pursuit earlier this week, now has an individual Olympic title to add to her collection.  The 25-year-old celebrated by pumping her fists and waving to the crowd before making a lap of the stadium with the Japanese flag fluttering above her head.  I\u2018m feeling very good,  Takagi told reporters.  Only lost focus on two laps, then I showed good acceleration. Then with 100 meters \u2013- go. I\u2018m very happy. I focus on team pursuit and mass start.   The race made its Olympic debut in South Korea and was given a touch of celebrity by the presence of Ivanka Trump, daughter of the U.S. President. It was a tactical encounter, with 16 skaters simultaneously vying for an advantage on the track. None of the trio who finished on the podium tried to win any of the three intermediate sprints, preferring instead to stay well back in the peloton and save their legs for the final push for a medal. The first three to finish the race earn 60, 40 and 20 points respectively, while the top three skaters in each of the intermediate sprints earn five, three and one points to decide the classification places. With two laps to go in the 16-lap race, the pack began to pick up speed, rapidly reeling in early pace-setter Saskia Alusalu of Estonia, who finished in fourth place after winning all three intermediate sprints. Schouten had the lead going into the final corner but the Dutch skater misjudged her line slightly and was forced wide coming out, and Takagi stormed up the inside channel to capitalize on the mistake. She crossed the line in a flurry of effort, her arms and legs pumping furiously to hold off Kim by a narrow margin. Kim was crestfallen after finishing second. She made a deep bow to the crowd and took a lap around the track waving her country\u2019s flag. Kim and her team mate in the women\u2019s team pursuit, Park Ji-woo, faced calls for them to be banned from the national team after they appeared to blame a team mate for their failure to reach the women\u2019s team pursuit semi-finals this week.  Because of me, it became controversial and I felt so sorry to everybody and so I bowed before the crowd,  Kim said. Additional reporting by Jane Chung; editing by Clare Fallon "

After nine nail-biting rounds, the U.S. team took victory with a 10-7 score. Team USA\u2019s only previous medal was a bronze in the 2006 XX Olympic Winter Games in Italy.  This year\u2019s win came after the team\u2019s unlikely path to the finals. Earlier in the Games, they appeared headed for disappointment after losing four of their first six round-robin matches. But they managed to make a shocking comeback by winning the three remaining games to advance to the semi-finals, where they beat Canada\u2013\u2013 a three-time gold medal-winning team.  It\u2019s a little surreal right now still, just coming off of where we were to where we are now,  American curler Tyler George said.  It feels like two different tournaments. One\u2019s a dream and one\u2019s a reality. Fortunately for us the winning streak is the reality, but we\u2019re trying not to get too excited.   Saturday was also vindication for a group once deemed the  Team of Rejects.  Skip John Shuster, whose five-point double takeout cinched the team\u2019s win, had in 2014 been left out of elite curling program after his weak performance during the 2014 Sochi Games. The Wisconsinsite got in shape, lost weight and rallied other underdog players, including George, a Minnesota liquor store owner known for his horrifyingly decrepit shoes.  Team Shuster would go on to take first in two U.S. national championships as well as the November qualifying trials for the Pyeongchang Olympics. It was a real Cinderella story. "

            "text": "Documents and bank records obtained in discovery during the federal investigation into the underbelly of college basketball detail in meticulous fashion the expenditures of prominent former NBA agent Andy Miller, his former associate Christian Dawkins and his agency, ASM Sports. They include expense reports and balance sheets that list cash advances, as well as entertainment and travel expenses for high school and college prospects and their families. Yahoo Sports viewed hundreds of pages of documents from the years-long probe that had federal authorities monitoring multiple targets and intercepting more than 4,000 calls across 330 days, providing a clear-eyed view into the pervasive nature of the game\u2019s underground economy. While three criminal cases tied to the investigation may take years to play out, the documents viewed by Yahoo revealed the extent of the potential NCAA ramifications from the case. The documents show an underground recruiting operation that could create NCAA rules issues \u2013 both current and retroactive \u2013 for at least 20 Division I basketball programs and more than 25 players. The documents tie some of the biggest names and programs in the sport to activity that appears to violate the NCAA\u2019s amateurism rules. This could end up casting a pall over the NCAA tournament because of eligibility issues. (NCAA officials declined a request for comment.) There\u2019s potential impermissible benefits and preferential treatment for players and families of players at Duke, North Carolina, Texas, Kentucky, Michigan State, USC, Alabama and a host of other schools. The documents link some of the sport\u2019s biggest current stars \u2013 Michigan State\u2019s Miles Bridges, Alabama\u2019s Collin Sexton and Duke\u2019s Wendell Carter \u2013 to specific potential extra benefits for either the athletes or their family members. The amounts tied to players in the case range from basic meals to tens of thousands of dollars. An ASM balance sheet in the hands of federal investigators shows accounts through Dec. 31, 2015, with the subheading,  Loan to Players.  It listed several who were in high school or college as receiving four-figure and five-figure payments from ASM Sports. Among the largest listed loans: Yahoo Sports reached out to officials at N.C. State, Seton Hall, Maryland, Kentucky and Washington. They all declined comment or did not return correspondence. In addition, Dawkins filed expense reports seeking reimbursement for thousands of dollars that he reported as being paid to college and high school players and their families. Several players, families of players or handlers received more than $1,000 in payments from ASM Sports before turning professional: Among those receiving hundreds of dollars in advances, according to Dawkins\u2019 expense reports: Additional Dawkins expense reports list meals and meetings with players or their families while in college or high school, and before they turned pro. While small amounts, these could be categorized as extra benefits under NCAA rules. It appears Dawkins paid for the meals, which could be an important distinction.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with meeting with an agent,  said Atlanta-based lawyer Stu Brown, a veteran of representing schools and coaches in NCAA compliance cases.  But then it becomes a question of who pays for the meal.  Among the players and/or families who are listed as meeting with or having meals with Dawkins: The breadth of names, schools and current players could offer a vexing test for both university compliance offices and the NCAA\u2019s enforcement division. The sheer number of potential cases and varying degrees of potential violations are vast. There\u2019s also an overriding factor of the ongoing criminal investigations. A complicating facet to it will be the NCAA\u2019s potential inability to view key documents related to this case, because those details not in the criminal complaints are sealed under protective order. In terms of eligibility, the NCAA and the institution may be prohibited from interviewing people associated with the case because of the parallel criminal cases. (The initial onus to decide is almost always on the school in an eligibility case.) No one is certain how the NCAA enforcement office would potentially handle the cases. The NCAA has been in constant contact with the feds but so far has had minimal direct involvement with the case, as they\u2019ve been careful to respect the boundaries of the criminal investigations. The likely scenario, according to Brown, would be for the schools to assess the credibility of what\u2019s in the documents and the severity of the potential violations.  There\u2019s potential for chaos, as it depends on the number of cases and the amount of information that\u2019s released,  Brown said.  There could be inconsistency as a subset of chaos, as different schools may very validly assess the credibility of [the cases] differently.  Yahoo did not view all of the documents in the three criminal cases tied to the investigation, but the records show an uncommon amount of detail for activities that have come under federal scrutiny. For example, the expense reports have hundreds of lines like: Feb. 10, 2016:  Flight for Brian Bowen mom. Flight for Brian Bowen. Flight for Brian Bowen dad.  They totaled more than $1,500. Feb. 1, 2016:  Advance to Apples Jones (Josh Jackson) $1,700.  Jan. 13, 2016:  ATM withdrawl: Advance to Fred Van Vleet $483.  May 3, 2016:  Redwood Lodge. Lunch w/Miles Bridges Parents. $70.05.  May 3, 2016:  ATM Withdrawl: Miles Bridges mom advance. $400  According to the documents, Dawkins has dinners listed with plenty of boldface names in the sport \u2013 Tom Izzo,  Villanova coaches,  Fultz and the family of wayward five-star prospect Mitchell Robinson. Along the way, a portrait emerges of the inner-workings of the office of Miller, who relinquished his NBA Players Association agent certification in the wake of the probe. Miller has yet to be charged in the case, and it\u2019s widely believed he\u2019s cooperating with the government. Dawkins\u2019 lawyer, Steve Haney, told Yahoo Sports earlier in the week it was  utter hypocrisy  that an underling like Dawkins and the four assistant coaches were charged in the case and their superiors have gone unscathed. Haney added on Thursday night in an email statement:  These are college eligibility issues and agent licensing issues, not matters of national security that deserve this level of FBI involvement and taxpayer resources\u2026..it has reached a degree of being ridiculous.  Dawkins, the 24-year-old former business associate, was arrested on Sept. 26 and faces felony charges of wire fraud and bribery in two of the three criminal cases tied to the investigation. He ended up on federal wiretaps and, soon after the case broke in late September, his rise became a cautionary tale for how vulnerable top coaches and programs are to the agent world. Yahoo Sports reached out to a dozen programs tied to the documents late Thursday. Only Xavier coach Chris Mack elected to release a statement. He said:  I have no relationship with Andy Miller or any of his associates. He plays no role in the recruitment of potential student athletes on Xavier\u2019s behalf. Beyond that, our staff has never created a path for him to foster a relationship with any of our student-athletes while enrolled at Xavier. Any suggestion that I or anyone on my staff utilized Andy Miller to provide even the slightest of financial benefits to a Xavier student-athlete is grossly misinformed. We are prepared to cooperate with any and all investigations at any level.  With an ongoing investigation, the chance looms there could be more charges and arrests. So far, four former assistant college basketball coaches have been arrested: Tony Bland of USC, Chuck Person of Auburn, Emanuel Richardson of Arizona and Lamont Evans of Oklahoma State. Six other assorted participants in the basketball underworld also have been arrested: Dawkins; former sneaker executives James Gatto and Merl Code; financial adviser Munish Sood; clothier and former referee Rashan Michel; and Florida AAU coach Brad Augustine. Charges against Augustine earlier were dismissed without explanation. The case has also cost Louisville coach Rick Pitino his job, as the school parted ways with the Hall of Famer soon after the details of the program\u2019s involvement in a six-figure agreement to sign five-star recruit Brian Bowen went public. Louisville athletic director Tom Jurich also was dismissed. At Auburn, two players and two members of the basketball support staff have been suspended. USC is withholding star point guard De\u2019Anthony Melton from competition this season as well.
