            "text": "At least two organizations have decided to drop Morgan Freeman after eight women accused him of inappropriate behavior and sexual harassment. Women who previously worked with the Oscar-winning actor told CNN that he repeatedly made comments about their bodies or their clothing and frequently engaged in inappropriate touching. In response to the allegations, Visa announced it had suspended him from its marketing campaign.  We are aware of the allegations that have been made against Mr. Freeman. At this point, Visa will be suspending our marketing in which the actor is featured,  Visa said in a statement. TransLink, Vancouver\u2019s public transit system, also decided to stop using Freeman\u2019s voice as part of an ad campaign to promote its Visa credit card and mobile payments on bus and Skytrain operations.  In light of information we\u2019ve learned ... of allegations regarding actor Morgan Freeman, TransLink has decided to pause his voice announcements as part of a Visa ad campaign on our transit system,  the transit system said a statement.  We will be reaching out to Visa to discuss further.  A few hours after the report was released, Freeman, 80, issued an apology:  Anyone who knows me or has worked with me knows I am not someone who would intentionally offend or knowingly make anyone feel uneasy, I apologize to anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected \u2014 that was never my intent.  A production assistant working on the 2015 film  Going in Style  said Morgan made numerous comments about her body, asked her several times if she was wearing underwear and tried to lift her skirt. Another worker on the set said women wore loose-fitting clothing in an effort to avoid Freeman\u2019s attention. Entertainment Tonight released footage on Thursday evening of two on-air interviews with Freeman that also revealed his attitude toward women. During an interview for the 2016 film  London Has Fallen,  Freeman asked a young female reporter,  My goodness, are you married? Fool around with other guys? I\u2019m just asking.  In 2015, he told author Janet Mock:  You got a dress halfway between your knee and your hips, and you sit down right across from me and you cross your legs.  Mock, who was a special correspondent for the interview, said Freeman\u2019s treatment of her was an  exhibition of the casual nature at which men in positions of power believe that everything belongs to them, including women\u2019s bodies.  Freeman\u2019s union, SAG-AFTRA, is considering what to do about Freeman\u2019s Life Achievement Award. The award is given to actors who represent the  finest ideals of the acting profession,  CNN reported.  These are compelling and devastating allegations which are absolutely contrary to all the steps that we are taking to ensure a safe work environment,  the union said in a statement.  Any accused person has the right to due process, but it is our starting point to believe the courageous voices who come forward to report incidents of harassment ... we are reviewing what corrective actions may be warranted at this time.

            "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Donald Trump administration has launched a national security investigation into car and truck imports that could lead to new U.S. tariffs similar to those imposed on imported steel and aluminum in March. The national security probe under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 would investigate whether vehicle and parts imports were threatening the industry\u2019s health and ability to research and develop new, advanced technologies, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday.  There is evidence suggesting that, for decades, imports from abroad have eroded our domestic auto industry,  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement, promising a  thorough, fair and transparent investigation.  Higher tariffs could be particularly painful for Asian automakers including Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co, Honda Motor Co and Hyundai Motor Co, which count the United States as a key market, and the announcement sparked a broad sell-off in automakers\u2019 shares across the region.  The governments of Japan, China and South Korea said they would monitor the situation, while Beijing, which is increasingly eyeing the United States as a potential market for its cars, added that it would defend its interests.  China opposes the abuse of national security clauses, which will seriously damage multilateral trade systems and disrupt normal international trade order,  Gao Feng, spokesman at the Ministry of Commerce, said at a regular news briefing on Thursday which focused largely on whether Beijing and Washington are making any progress in their growing trade dispute.  We will closely monitor the situation under the U.S. probe and fully evaluate the possible impact and resolutely defend our own legitimate interests.  The probe comes as Trump courts voters in the U.S. industrial heartland ahead of mid-term elections later this year, and opens a new front in his  America First  trade agenda aimed at clawing back manufacturing jobs lost to overseas competitors. It could raise the costs for overseas automakers to export vehicles and parts to the world\u2019s second-largest auto market. Growing trade tensions over cars and car parts, particularly with China, could raise risks for U.S. companies expanding their presence in the country, signs of which are already emerging. Earlier this month, Reuters reported that Ford Motor Co\u2019s imported vehicles were being held up at Chinese ports, adding to a growing list of U.S. products facing issues at China\u2019s borders. The majority of vehicles sold in the United States by Japanese and South Korean automakers are produced there, but most firms also export to the U.S. from plants in Asia, Mexico, Canada and other countries. Roughly one-third of all U.S. vehicle imports last year were from Asia. In addition to recently imposed 25 percent tariffs on steel and 10 percent tariffs on aluminum imports, the administration has threatened tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods over intellectual property complaints, and Beijing has vowed to respond. The administration is also trying to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement to return more auto production to the United States. Commerce said the new probe would determine whether lost domestic production had weakened the U.S.  internal economy  and its ability to develop connected vehicle systems, autonomous vehicles, fuel cells, electric motors and batteries, and advanced manufacturing processes. In a separate statement, Trump said:  Core industries such as automobiles and automotive parts are critical to our strength as a Nation.  A Trump administration official said before the announcement that the expected move was aimed partly at pressuring Canada and Mexico to make concessions in talks to update the NAFTA that have languished in part over auto provisions, as well as pressuring Japan and the European Union, which also export large numbers of vehicles to the United States. An ad hoc industry group representing the largest Japanese, German and other foreign automakers called  Here for America,  criticized the effort.  To our knowledge, no one is asking for this protection. This path leads inevitably to fewer choices and higher prices for cars and trucks in America,  said John Bozzella, chief executive of Global Automakers, a trade group representing Toyota, Nissan Motor Co Ltd, Hyundai Motor Co and others. A Toyota spokeswoman said that the company was monitoring the situation. Chinese automaker Geely Holding Group urged free trade practices for the auto industry, which is built on a complex supply chain under which vehicle components for any given car often originates from numerous countries.  As a global manufacturer, Geely Holding Group is in favor of free trade and open markets. Free trade creates jobs, wealth and economic growth,  a spokesman said, adding that its plant in South Carolina to produce its Volvo brand cars showed its commitment to the country. Shares in Toyota, Honda and Hyundai each fell roughly 3 percent in local trade following the announcement, while Mazda Motor Corp, which does not have any U.S. production capacity at the moment, tumbled more than 5 percent. Late last week, Japan\u2019s automakers\u2019 association urged its export partners to keep tariffs on vehicles and components low and maintain free trade relationships. Roughly 12 million cars and trucks were produced in the United States last year, while the country imported 8.3 million vehicles worth $192 billion. This included 2.4 million from Mexico, 1.8 million from Canada, 1.7 million from Japan, 930,000 from South Korea and 500,000 from Germany, according to U.S. government statistics. At the same time, the United States exported nearly 2 million vehicles worldwide worth $57 billion. German automakers Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG and BMW AG all have large U.S. assembly plants. The United States is the second-biggest export destination for German auto manufacturers after China, while vehicles and car parts are Germany\u2019s biggest source of export income. Asked if the measures would hit Mexico and Canada, a Mexican source close to the NAFTA talks said:  That probably is going to be the next battle.

            "text": "The best way to watch Harvey Weinstein walk himself into a Manhattan police precinct on Friday morning was via NBC News\u2019 Periscope. As the former Oscar-winning Hollywood producer and  king of indie film  marched from his black car into the police station, NBC correspondent Craig Melvin began naming some of the 95 women who have come forward with allegations against Weinstein \u2015 Lucia Evans, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Uma Thurman, Salma Hayek. Reaction icons started floating up the right side of the screen, little hearts of different colors, one after another after another, until they formed a cloud of  likes.  We, the people of the internet, were engaging in a collective act of schadenfreude, and it was delicious. Women are so often told to contain our anger, to make it more palatable, less  aggressive,  small enough to contain within the male prerogative. But I\u2019m angry at men like Harvey Weinstein, and there\u2019s nothing palatable about it.  The man who beckoned young women to his hotel rooms for the sole purpose of using them, who hired ex-Mossad agents to track anyone liable to expose him, who had vast resources at his fingertips and used them liberally to try to silence the dozens of women he (allegedly) victimized \u2015 even that man is no longer untouchable.  That man had to walk past reporters as he entered a police station, submitting to the cheap cop pornography of the perp walk. That man looked haggard and tilted his head low to avoid eyes and questions. That man also carried two books with him into the police station, biographies of Big Men in Show Biz \u2014 Elia Kazan, and Rodgers and Hammerstein \u2014 because he is, after all, exactly the kind of prick who fancies himself both a legend and a victim of a pious mob. That man was charged with rape, committing a criminal sex act, sexual abuse and sexual misconduct.  It is still shocking to see powerful men face criminal charges for harming women, and even more shocking to see them convicted. And the process leading up to that \u2015 the public offerings of private pain (hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers \u2026), the scrutiny of that pain, the way it\u2019s picked apart and held up to the light and valued according to how neatly it can be added to a pile of other women\u2019s pain \u2015 is not a pretty one. The rapid rise of the Me Too movement has been exhilarating to witness but also exhausting.  There are few moments of relief when an eternity of systemic abuse is being unpacked and processed. When those moments do present themselves, your instinct is to seize them like a prize. Weinstein is the man behind some of the most recognizable films of my lifetime, but surely the footage many of us will most remember him for is Friday\u2019s walk. A big man in a blue sweater, displayed like any other perp for our delectation, tokens of self-pity and self-regard in the crook of his arm.  As Rose McGowan tweeted Friday morning:  We got you, Harvey Weinstein, we got you.  I hope all 95 women who have said Weinstein violated them saw the footage, and I hope they let themselves feel even a nanosecond of pleasure. When (some) men are (finally) held accountable for their abuses, it does not undo the pain and damage they\u2019ve wrought. But maybe, just maybe, it feels damn good to watch. "

            "text": "Multiple women have accused actor Morgan Freeman of inappropriate behavior and harassment. The allegations surfaced Thursday in a report from CNN, with eight individuals telling the network that they were victims of harassment and inappropriate behavior by Freeman. Sixteen people in total spoke to CNN about the actor\u2019s alleged behavior as part of the investigation. An unidentified woman told the network she was harassed by Freeman in 2015 while working as a production assistant for the comedy  Going in Style  starring the famed actor. The woman said Freeman often touched her inappropriately and made comments about her body and clothing daily. Freeman  kept trying to lift up my skirt and asking if I was wearing underwear  at one point while they worked together, the woman alleged. Actor Alan Arkin  made a comment telling him to stop. Morgan got freaked out and didn\u2019t know what to say.  Another woman told CNN that while working on the 2012 movie  Now You See Me,  Freeman sexually harassed her multiple times.  He did comment on our bodies,  the second accuser told CNN.  We knew that if he was coming by ... not to wear any top that would show our breasts, not to wear anything that would show our bottoms, meaning not wearing clothes that [were] fitted,  she said. Other inappropriate behavior included staring at women\u2019s breasts, massaging an intern\u2019s shoulders, asking a woman how she felt about sexual harassment and asking women to twirl for him, according to CNN. TransLink, Vancouver\u2019s major transportation company, said it would be suspending new voiceovers that featured Freeman as part of an ad campaign for Visa. In a statement, Freeman said he is not someone who would  intentionally offend.   Anyone who knows me or has worked with me knows I am not someone who would intentionally offend or knowingly make anyone feel uneasy,  he said.  I apologize to anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected \u2015 that was never my intent.  This has been updated with TransLink\u2019s response to the allegations.  "

            "text": "When it comes to New York Jets players kneeling during the national anthem, team chairman Christopher Johnson is a standup guy. Johnson said the team wouldn\u2019t fine any player for protesting, despite a new NFL owner-approved measure that enables teams to do so, according to reports. Wednesday\u2019s rule change says players must stand for the anthem or stay off the field. If any player kneels, his team would face a league fine. Teams can discipline individual players.  As I have in the past, I will support our players wherever we land as a team,  Johnson said in a statement, according to the New York Post.  Our focus is not on imposing any Club rules, fines, or restrictions. Instead we will continue to work closely with our players to constructively advance social justice issues that are important to us. I remain extremely proud of how we demonstrated unity last season as well as our players\u2019 commitment to strengthening our communities.  Johnson elaborated on his pledge not to fine players in an interview with Newsday.   I do not like imposing any club-specific rules,  he said.  If somebody (on the Jets) takes a knee, that fine will be borne by the organization, by me, not the players.  I never want to put restrictions on the speech of our players. Do I prefer they stand? Of course. But I understand if they feel the need to protest. There are some big, complicated issues that we\u2019re all struggling with, and our players are on the front lines.  Johnson\u2019s stance could get interesting in the team\u2019s hierarchy. He has been designated as the acting owner while his brother, team owner Woody Johnson, serves as President Donald Trump\u2019s ambassador to the United Kingdom, CBS Sports pointed out. Trump, who has repeatedly criticized demonstrating players, applauded the new NFL edict.  You have to stand proudly for the national anthem or you shouldn\u2019t be playing,  he said. The NFL Players Association criticized the league for failing to consult the union before the change, and vowed to carefully review the new policy. "

            "text": "President Donald Trump told reporters Thursday that he is pardoning late heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson, who was arrested in 1912 for driving his white girlfriend across state lines. Trump indicated last month he was considering pardoning the boxer at the urging of actor Sylvester Stallone, who was present at Thursday\u2019s announcement at the White House.  Johnson, the first black man to earn the title of heavyweight boxing champion of the world, died in 1946 after serving time for violating the Mann Act, which banned traveling with a woman across state lines for an  immoral purpose.   Johnson served 10 months in federal prison for what many view as a racially motivated injustice,  Trump said Thursday.  He was treated very rough, very tough.  The son of former slaves, Johnson gained fame and wealth through his boxing career despite rampant racism and violence against blacks at the time. Obama, however, kept to the presidential tradition of almost never granting a posthumous pardon.  "

            "text": "President Donald Trump vocalized his support for the National Football League\u2019s new rule that requires players to stand during the national anthem, telling Fox News that perhaps the players who refuse to abide  shouldn\u2019t be in the country.  The NFL approved the policy on Wednesday in a push to end kneeling during the anthem, which Colin Kaepernick began in 2016 football season as a silent protest in the face of rising racial violence and police brutality. The players not on board will have to stay in the locker room.  Trump praised the league for the new rule that would stop national anthem protests before they happen, saying NFL owners did the right thing.   I don\u2019t think people should be staying in locker rooms,  Trump told Fox News.  You have to stand proudly for the national anthem or you shouldn\u2019t be playing. You shouldn\u2019t be there. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t be in the country.  Trump has derided players and team owners for the kneeling protests on multiple occasions, sparking a debate as to whether the protests were disrespectful of the U.S. military or an expression of First Amendment rights.  NFL commissioner Roger Goodell addressed the controversy in a statement after the new rule was announced that  on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of NFL players were unpatriotic.  At an Alabama rally in September, Trump called players who kneeled a  son of a bitch  and encouraged fans to boycott games when the protests occurred. The president has continued to bring up the issue and alluded to it while welcoming NASCAR Champion Martin Truex Jr. to the White House on Monday.  And I will tell you one thing I know about NASCAR: They do indeed, Brian, stand for the playing of the national anthem, right?  Trump said on Monday.  They do indeed.  Others from the Trump administration have praised the NFL\u2019s rule change on Wednesday, including Vice President Mike Pence and the president\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr. Pence, who left an Indianapolis Colts game after players kneeled last year, posted a screenshot of the news and captioned it  #winning  on Twitter. Trump Jr. posted a similar tweet on Wednesday captioning an AP article with  STILL NOT SICK OF #WINNING!!!!   Despite the Trump administration\u2019s celebrations on Twitter, however, the rule may not be the end of kneeling protests.  The NFL Player\u2019s Association, which has supported the players\u2019 right to protest, issued a release on Wednesday stating it would review the new rule and challenge any aspect inconsistent with its collective bargaining agreement.   The NFL chose to not consult the union in the development of this \u2018policy,\u2019 the statement said.  NFL players have shown their patriotism through their social activism, their community service, in support of our military and law enforcement and yes, through their protests to raise awareness about the issues they care about.   Other Twitter users have noted that the NFL is made up of predominantly black athletes, who could decide to boycott the ruling together.   The NFL is about 70% black,  tweeted Dominque Hamilton, a former University of Missouri football player.  If united and didn\u2019t take the field at all, it would upset a lot of people and a lot of executives.  "

            "text": "The NFL on Wednesday approved a new policy to intercept national anthem protests before they happen, according to the league. The measure mandates that players who are on the field must stand for the national anthem but can remain in the locker room if they choose. Teams could be fined by the league if their players sit or kneel, as many have done in protest of racial injustice and police brutality in recent seasons after NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick\u2019s initial kneeling protest in 2016 earned nationwide attention. The fining or punishment of players and other personnel would be dictated by the individual teams. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell noted in a statement Wednesday that  on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of NFL players were unpatriotic.   This season, all league and team personnel shall stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem,  he said.  Personnel who choose not to stand for the Anthem may stay in the locker room until after the Anthem has been performed.  The NFL Players Association criticized the league for failing to consult with the union on the matter.  Our union will review the new \u2018policy\u2019 and challenge any aspect of it that is inconsistent with the collective bargaining agreement,  the union said. On Tuesday, Sports Illustrated reported on a different, apparently scrapped, proposal in which teams could be penalized on the field for players kneeling. In that scenario, the home team would decide whether both teams would come out of the locker room for  The Star-Spangled Banner.  And if the teams do emerge and players kneel, officials could assess a 15-yard penalty, the outlet wrote, citing unnamed sources.  As always, conversations at league meetings are candid, thoughtful and thorough,  NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told HuffPost in an email early Wednesday.  The clubs explore every option and idea on any policy, and discuss the merits and drawbacks of each approach. We will continue the conversation this morning.  The league also debated the issue in previous meetings since former 49ers quarterback Kaepernick sparked national controversy in the 2016 season by taking a knee during the anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. The movement, which grew to include other players and teams, continued in 2017, prompting repeated outrage from President Donald Trump. Kaepernick, who was not signed by an NFL team in 2017 after he became a free agent, and former teammate Eric Reid, who also protested, have filed grievances against the league for allegedly conspiring to keep them off NFL rosters because of the demonstrations.

            "text": "A legal defense fund created in the wake of the Me Too movement is confronting two of the largest employers in the United States about sexual harassment in the workplace. The Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, housed by the National Women\u2019s Law Center, on Tuesday announced new efforts to tackle claims of sexual misconduct at McDonald\u2019s and Walmart. Female cooks and cashiers at McDonald\u2019s, with the financial support of the defense fund, have filed 10 charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in recent days against restaurant locations in nine cities, including Detroit, Los Angeles and New Orleans. One McDonald\u2019s worker in Chicago alleges that a manager asked her if she wanted to see his penis, and described  lurid fantasies  about what he would like to do to her. She said she was fired when she reported the harassment, according to a press release about her case. Breauna Morrow, a 15-year-old cashier at a McDonald\u2019s in St. Louis, said her supervisors did nothing when she complained of a co-worker who repeatedly sexually harassed her.  McDonald\u2019s advertises all over television saying it\u2019s \u2018America\u2019s best first job,\u2019 but my experience has been a nightmare,  Breauna said in a statement.  I know I\u2019m not the only one and that\u2019s why I\u2019m speaking out, so others don\u2019t have to face the harassment I\u2019ve gone through.  The lawsuits are among the first to arise following the creation of the defense fund in late 2017, amid a wave of sexual misconduct allegations against powerful men in Hollywood, the media and other industries. The Time\u2019s Up Defense Fund, backed in part by A-listers like Reese Witherspoon and Kerry Washington, offers financial backing for workers to effectively challenge sexual harassment.  Sexual harassment takes a devastating toll on the women who endure it,  Sharyn Tejani, director of the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, said on a call with reporters Tuesday.  The fast food industry has an atrocious record on sexual harassment in the workplace,  Tejani said.  No worker at any job ever should have to endure abuse for a paycheck.  Fight for $15, the organization focused on establishing a higher minimum wage for fast-food workers, partnered with Time\u2019s Up on the McDonald\u2019s cases. Fight for $15 announced Tuesday that it has set up a hotline for fast-food workers to have their charges reviewed by lawyers.  The McDonald\u2019s workers are demanding the company enforce the zero tolerance policy against sexual harassment outlined in its manual. They are also calling for mandatory sexual harassment trainings for managers and employees. In a statement to HuffPost, Terri Hickey, a spokeswoman for McDonald\u2019s USA, said the company is  committed to a culture that fosters the respectful treatment of everyone.   There is no place for harassment and discrimination of any kind in our workplace,  Hickey said.  McDonald\u2019s Corporation takes allegations of sexual harassment very seriously and are confident our independent franchisees who own and operate approximately 90 percent of our 14,000 U.S. restaurants will do the same.  The Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund also announced Tuesday its role in a lawsuit filed by Gina Pitre, a former Walmart worker in Mississippi. Pitre alleges that her manager made  unwelcomed sexual comments [and] unwelcomed requests for text pictures  during her time at Walmart, the country\u2019s largest corporate employer of women.  For more than a year, my manager at Walmart repeatedly sexually harassed me while I was on the job,  Pitre said in a statement.  I tried to tell the company what was happening, but Walmart did nothing to hold the harasser accountable or keep me safe.  Randy Hargrove, a spokesman for Walmart, told HuffPost the company had investigated Pitre\u2019s accusations and  could not find sufficient evidence to substantiate a violation of our discrimination and harassment policy.   We take this matter seriously and we will respond appropriately,  Hargrove said. Last week, members of OUR Walmart, an advocacy group for retail workers, sent a letter to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, demanding the company commit to stricter policies on sexual harassment. The letter, signed by several high-profile activists including actress Susan Sarandon, called on Walmart to create a streamlined, transparent process for filing sexual harassment complaints. Hargrove said the company already has  strong policies and procedures in place to address allegations of sexual harassment.   We believe our current practices meet or exceed many of the requests in the letter,  he said.  Like anything at Walmart, we will continue to review our policies and enhance them as appropriate.  Pitre and other OUR Walmart members refuse to back down until they feel meaningful change has taken place.  I\u2019m speaking up for justice for myself and so that no woman has to experience what I went through at Walmart or in any job,  Pitre said in a statement.  Time is up for sexual harassment \u2015 and for companies that won\u2019t take action to protect their employees.  Need help?

            "text": "Starbucks announced a new policy of inclusivity on Saturday that will permit anyone to sit in its cafes or use the stores\u2019 restrooms, regardless of whether they\u2019ve bought anything, The Associated Press reported. The move comes weeks after one of the coffee chain\u2019s stores in Philadelphia incited outrage for calling the police on two black men who had not made a purchase while they waited for a friend to arrive.  We are committed to creating a culture of warmth and belonging where everyone is welcome,  the company said in a statement. Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson were arrested for  trespassing  on April 12 after a Starbucks store manager in Philadelphia called the police. Nelson said he\u2019d asked the manager if he could use the restroom when he arrived in the cafe but was told the facilities were for paying customers only. The men said they\u2019d been waiting for a friend to arrive when the police arrived and they were arrested \u2015 mere minutes after they\u2019d entered the store. Their arrest, captured on camera, quickly became a public relations nightmare for Starbucks. Protests erupted at the Philadelphia store and demonstrators accused the cafe\u2019s staff of racism. The manager no longer works for the company.  The company moved quickly to control the damage. Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson flew to Philadelphia soon after the incident to personally meet with the two men, who later settled with the company for an undisclosed sum and free college tuition for an online program created by Starbucks for its employees. Separately, they got a symbolic $1 each from the city of Philadelphia and a pledge from officials to set up a $200,000 to promote entrepreneurship among high school students. Johnson also announced plans to close more than 8,000 Starbucks stores in the U.S. on May 29 so workers can receive training about racial bias. Starbucks said Saturday that going forward, its employees had been told to  consider anyone who walks into its stores a customer  \u2015 whether or not they buy anything, reported AP. The company noted, however, that law enforcement will be notified if a customer appears to pose a threat to safety. Starbucks founder and chairman Howard Schultz said last week that while the company doesn\u2019t  want to become a public bathroom... we\u2019re going to make the right decision 100 percent of the time and give people the key.   We don\u2019t want anyone at Starbucks to feel as if we are not giving access to you to the bathroom because you are less than. We want you to be more than,  Schultz said during a Thursday discussion at Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank, according to Bloomberg.  "

            "text": " Ladies and gentlemen, please rise for our national anthem.  You\u2019ll hear some version of this announcement at the start of most sporting events, whether they be professional, college or youth-level. The performance of the national anthem is a well-established part of American athletic competitions.  Yet  The Star-Spangled Banner  typically doesn\u2019t make an appearance at many other public gatherings. We don\u2019t sing or listen to it before concerts, Broadway shows, operas or lectures. So why do we do this for sports?  The answer goes back to America\u2019s pastime: baseball. First, of course, the national anthem began as a poem written by Francis Scott Key in September 1814, after he witnessed the British bombardment of Fort McHenry in Maryland during the War of 1812 (which ran until early 1815).  During the 19th century, the poem gained popularity as a song set to the tune of another popular song,  To Anacreon in Heaven.  It was performed at events like parades, military ceremonies, Independence Day festivities and, yes,  occasionally, sporting events. The earliest documented performance of  The Star-Spangled Banner  at a baseball game took place at the Union Baseball and Cricket Grounds in Brooklyn, New York, on May 15, 1862. It was the park\u2019s opening game, and over time, playing the song on the opening day of the baseball season became a more widespread practice. But singing  The Star-Spangled Banner  before every game did not become commonplace until later.  In 1889, Secretary of the Navy Benjamin F. Tracy signed an order directing that  The Star-Spangled Banner  be the official song to accompany any raising of the American flag by the Navy. In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson signed an executive order designating it as the country\u2019s national anthem for patriotic occasions. But that status didn\u2019t become truly official until 1931, when Congress passed a measure that President Herbert Hoover signed into law. Historians typically point to one notable event when tracing the connection between the national anthem and sporting events: Game 1 of the 1918 World Series between the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs. It was the final year of World War I, a time when many professional baseball games featured marching drills, live bands and other patriotic elements. Given the strains of wartime, however, Game 1 was not well-attended, and the mood was reportedly somber.  During the seventh-inning stretch, however, the band lifted spectators\u2019 spirits with a powerful performance of  The Star-Spangled Banner.  The New York Times recounted the moment:  As the crowd of 10,274 spectators \u2014 the smallest that has witnessed the diamond classic in many years \u2014 stood up to take their afternoon yawn, that has been the privilege and custom of baseball fans for many generations, the band broke forth to the strains of  The Star-Spangled Banner.  The performance was so well-received that bands played the song during the subsequent games in the World Series that year. And from then on,  The Star-Spangled Banner  was a regular feature of special baseball occasions like opening day, national holidays and the World Series. During World War II, playing the national anthem before regular baseball games became the norm, thanks to an upswing in patriotic sentiment and technological developments in sound systems that allowed for the playing of the song without the added expense of hiring a band. The practice spread to other sports as well. After the war ended in 1945, NFL Commissioner Elmer Layden stated his intention to make  The Star-Spangled Banner  a permanent part of every football game.   We must not drop it simply because the war is over. We should never forget what it stands for,  Layden declared.  Not everyone in the sports world agreed, however. In 1954, Baltimore Orioles general manager and World War I veteran Arthur Ehlers decided not to play  The Star-Spangled Banner  before each game and opted to save it for special occasions. He said that frequent repetition  tends to cheapen the song and lessen the thrill of response  and complained about fans not behaving respectfully during the anthem.  Under pressure from the public and the Baltimore City Council, Ehlers eventually changed his mind.  The owner of the Chicago Cubs felt similarly and did not include  The Star-Spangled Banner  as a standard element at home games until the 1960s during the Vietnam War. The Chicago White Sox replaced the anthem with  God Bless America  for a time in the \u201960s but then returned to  The Star-Spangled Banner  after fans expressed their preference for it in an official poll.  With its evocations of warfare and patriotism,  The Star-Spangled Banner  has become a seemingly inextricable part of American sports culture \u2015 and even pop culture, thanks to iconic moments like Whitney Houston\u2019s powerful 1991 Super Bowl performance during the Gulf War.   Sports are a kind of bloodless warfare,  Marc Ferris, author of Star-Spangled Banner: The Unlikely Story of America\u2019s National Anthem, told USA Today last year.  A sort of war without death.  Over the years, the anthem has certainly played a part in cultural wars. Most recently, quarterback Colin Kaepernick\u2019s decision to protest racial injustice by kneeling during  The Star-Spangled Banner  has been the subject of heated debate.  In 1968, Olympic athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos were thrown out of Olympic Stadium in Mexico City after raising their fists in a Black Power salute as they stood on the medal podium during  The Star-Spangled Banner.   Beyond political protests, actual musical performances of the anthem have generated controversy. In 1968, singer-songwriter Jos\u00e9 Feliciano kicked off Game 5 of the World Series with a bluesy version of the song, which drew complaints from fans expecting a more traditional rendition. In 1990, comedian Roseanne Barr sang the anthem before a Major League Baseball game. She ended her  screechy, off-key  performance by grabbing her crotch and spitting on the ground. President George H.W. Bush called Barr\u2019s rendition  disgraceful.  And in February of this year, singer Fergie came under fire for her  sexy  performance of the anthem at the NBA All-Star Game. For a song meant to unite the country,  The Star-Spangled Banner  can also be quite divisive \u2015 which perhaps makes it all the more fitting for sports.

For the first time in the Miss America pageant\u2019s history, its leadership teams will be headed by women, all of whom are former pageant winners. The pageant, established in 1921, announced the appointment of two women on Thursday to head its foundation and its day-to-day operations. The announcement follows an email scandal first reported by HuffPost in December that led to the swift resignation of two male leaders. The leaked emails revealed disparaging and misogynistic comments about the pageant\u2019s participants. Regina Hopper, a former Miss Arkansas who previously served as chair of the Miss America Foundation, will now serve as the Miss America Organization\u2019s president and chief executive officer. Marjorie Vincent-Tripp, who won the Miss America title in 1991, will head the foundation\u2019s board of trustees after serving on it in 2016. The pageant\u2019s organization and foundation are separate nonprofits, with the organization overseeing the competition and the foundation processing the recipients\u2019 scholarships, according to the pageant\u2019s website. The appointments follow former Fox News host and Miss America pageant winner Gretchen Carlson becoming the first Miss America to be appointed to lead the organization\u2019s board of trustees in January.  By putting female leadership in place, we hope to send a strong signal,  Hopper told The Associated Press this week.  We want young women to see Miss America as a place where they can come and benefit and be empowered.  Vincent-Tripp, in a statement shared on the pageant\u2019s website, celebrated the appointments as a new chapter.  It is my hope to continue the mission of expanding the reach of the Foundation to provide scholarship opportunities for young women across the board,  she said. Both Hopper and Vincent-Tripp are lawyers and former TV journalists.  The induction of this all-female leadership team signals forthcoming transformational changes to the entire organization and program, ushering in a new era of progressiveness, inclusiveness and empowerment,  the pageant said in a statement.

            "text": "SEATTLE (Reuters) - Seattle\u2019s city council on Monday approved a new tax for the city\u2019s biggest companies, including Amazon.com Inc., to combat a housing crisis attributed in part to a local economic boom that has driven up real estate costs at the expense of the working class. Amazon, the city\u2019s largest employer, said after the vote that it would go ahead with planning for a major downtown office building that it earlier had put on hold over its objections to a much stiffer tax plan originally proposed. As passed on a 9-0 vote after a boisterous public hearing, the measure would apply to most companies grossing at least $20 million a year, levying a tax of roughly 14 cents per employee per hour worked within the city - about $275 annually for each worker. That  head tax  formula is designed to raise $45 million to $49 million a year over the five-year life of the tax - down from an original $75 million annually - to build more affordable housing and support services for the homeless. The tax would end after five years unless renewed by the city. Amazon had led private-sector opposition to the plan, saying earlier this month it was freezing expansion planning for Seattle pending the outcome of Monday\u2019s action. The move by the world\u2019s largest online retailer, owned by billionaire entrepreneur Jeff Bezos, put in question more than 7,000 new jobs. Following the council vote, Amazon\u2019s vice president, Drew Herdener, said the company has resumed construction planning for its so-called Block 18 project in downtown Seattle, following the pause it announced two weeks ago. However, he added,  We remain very apprehensive about the future created by the council\u2019s hostile approach and rhetoric toward larger businesses, which forces us to question our growth here.  Amazon said it is still evaluating whether to sub-lease space in a second future office tower in Seattle, a project called Rainier Square, meaning it may move some planned jobs elsewhere and thus avoid further raising its tax liability. The tax also would hit such Seattle-based stalwarts as coffee retailer Starbucks and department store chain Nordstrom, as well as California-based tech giants like Apple, Google and Facebook that have enough of a presence in Seattle that they would be subject to the new levy. The tax is expected to be borne by about 500 companies, accounting for 3 percent of the city\u2019s private sector. Healthcare companies are exempt, as are non-profits. Sponsors of the tax said Seattle\u2019s biggest-earning businesses should bear some burden for easing a shortage in low-cost housing that they helped create by driving up real estate prices to the point where the working poor and many middle-class families can no longer afford to live in the city. Supporters cite data showing Seattle\u2019s median home prices have soared to $820,000, and more than 41 percent of renters in the city ranked as  rent-burdened,  meaning they pay at least 30 percent of their income on housing. The Seattle metropolitan area also is home to the third-largest concentrations of homeless people, nearly 12,000 counted in a January U.S. government survey, and almost half of them were living on the streets or otherwise unsheltered. Mayor Jenny Durkan, who expressed concern that the original proposal would lead to an economic backlash, said she would sign the new tax ordinance into law. She had offered an amendment to essentially cut the original $75 million tax proposal in half, but her proposal was rejected last Friday. Council members then negotiated over the weekend to craft a compromise that would gain greater support and was certain to win a veto-proof majority. On Monday, about 40 elected officials from across the United States, some representing local governments in the running to host Amazon\u2019s second headquarters, published an open letter to Seattle in support of the head tax and expressing concern that Amazon opposed the measure.  By threatening Seattle over this tax, Amazon is sending a message to all of our cities: we play by our own rules,  the officials wrote. The head tax approved on Monday is not the first. Denver has enacted a similar tax, and Chicago had one but repealed it. Seattle itself had a head tax in effect from 2006 to 2009 but it was repealed to help businesses in the midst of the recession.

            "text": "Uber will no longer force individual victims of sexual harassment or assault into forced arbitration, the ride-hailing company\u2019s chief legal officer Tony West announced in a blog post Tuesday morning.  Riders, drivers or employees who have been sexually assaulted or discriminated against are free to choose the venue they want to pursue their claims against the company, wrote West, who was a top-ranking official in the Justice Department during the Obama administration and has spoken previously about the pervasiveness of sexual harassment and gender discrimination.  It\u2019s important to give sexual assault and harassment survivors control of how they pursue their claims,  West wrote in the post, noting the company\u2019s need to regain the public\u2019s trust.  Whatever they decide, they will be free to tell their story wherever and however they see fit.  The move comes less than three weeks after 14 women, who said they were sexually assaulted by their Uber drivers, penned an open letter to the company\u2019s board urging it to allow them to pursue justice in an open courtroom, rather than in arbitration.  Silencing our stories deprives customers and potential investors from the knowledge that our horrific experiences are part of a widespread problem at Uber,  the women wrote.  This is not doing the \u2018right thing,\u2019  they said, alluding to the company\u2019s new motto:  We do the right thing. Period.  The letter drew widespread media coverage, including over the issue of forced arbitration. The app\u2019s terms of service require any rider with a complaint against the company, even of sexual assault, to commit to arbitration, essentially private courtrooms where a company typically has the edge in any litigation. West, who did a stint at PepsiCo before joining Uber, credits the new motto in his post on Tuesday, explaining that in order to actually do the right thing the company must now act with  transparency, integrity, and accountability.  Victims can now decide whether to pursue their case in open court or through mediation or arbitration, he wrote. And when survivors settle cases with Uber, the company will no longer require them to remain silent about what happened to them as part of the deal, he added.  Uber also said that it would publicly release a safety report that will include data on sexual assaults and other incidents that occur on the Uber platform. The moves are effective immediately, the company said, and apply to all cases currently pending against the company. Those who previously signed non-disclosure agreements will still be bound by those NDAs.  [Uber CEO] Dara [Khosrowshahi] recently said that sexual predators often look for a dark corner,  West wrote.  Our message to the world is that we need to turn the lights on.  One other tech company \u2015 Microsoft \u2015 has gotten rid of forced arbitration in harassment lawsuits. But Uber\u2019s move is sure to affect far more people, as millions use the service each year. On Tuesday afternoon, Uber\u2019s closest competitor, Lyft, followed its lead and made a similar announcement.   Today, 48 hours prior to an impending lawsuit against their company, Uber made the good decision to adjust their policies,  a Lyft spokesperson said in an email to HuffPost.  We agree with the changes.  Lyft said it was ending its forced arbitration policy for sexual assault victims, whether they\u2019re riders, drivers or employees. Like Uber, the company would still force class actions into arbitration. Lyft also said it would no longer require confidentiality in settlement agreements and plans to release data on sexual assaults. The company said it did not have an estimate of how much the change will cost and declined to say how many harassment and discrimination cases it has pending. Uber\u2019s new policy only applies to individual cases. Victims and survivors who wish to band together and bring class action litigation against the company will still be barred from doing so. For its part, Uber contends that the vast majority of the suits filed against it are at the individual level. Other riders with complaints against the company \u2015 outside the realm of harassment and discrimination \u2015 will still be held to the fine print in the app\u2019s terms of service agreement, requiring that disputes be settled via arbitration.  Uber also said it now supports federal legislation that would allow individuals to opt out of arbitration in cases of sexual assault and discrimination. A bipartisan bill like that was introduced earlier this year with the help of Gretchen Carlson, the former Fox News host who was able to sue the company\u2019s chairman and CEO despite an arbitration clause in her contract.   I\u2019m proud to see companies joining our fight to end arbitration to give more women a voice in harassment and assault cases and unveil the secrecy,  Carlson told HuffPost.  I\u2019m hopeful more companies will follow suit.  Earlier this year, Facebook told HuffPost it was considering whether to support that legislation \u2015 and defended its use of arbitration. All 50 state attorneys general have expressed support for the bill, known as the End Arbitration Act for Sexual Harassment. In the meantime, the fate of many of those women\u2019s assault cases is far from clear. Nine of the 14 women who wrote that open letter are currently suing the company and have asked a California court for class-action status for their case. The women will now be free to pursue their assault charges in court, but only on an individual level. They\u2019re also suing Uber for misleading advertising and fraud \u2015 and the company said those claims would still have to be arbitrated.  Our hope is that Uber ending forced arbitration for victims of sexual assault will begin a process to reduce future suffering by women passengers,  Jean Christensen, the lawyer representing the nine victims.  Uber has made a critical step in this direction, but preventing victims from proceeding together, on a class basis, shows that Uber is not fully committed to meaningful change.  Victims are more likely to come forward knowing they can proceed as a group.  This is the beginning of a longer process needed to meaningfully improve safety.  Moving to disclose data on rapes and sexual assaults is risky for the company, West acknowledged in an interview with The New York Times. He said he struggled with the decision because he knows it will be  disturbing,  according to the Times. Uber is a large company and it\u2019s fairly easy to lodge a complaint against it. Also, there\u2019s no standard on how to report such incidents, the company noted. Uber still hasn\u2019t made one key demand: Tightening its driver background checks by running fingerprints through FBI and DOJ databases.  Uber has  so much money that they are willing to allow customers to sue them in court for what happens to them, but they are not willing to make the changes which would make the customers safe,  said Christensen. Uber disputes the usefulness of fingerprint checks and has pointed out that it has made a raft of changes to tighten up safety over the past year. Uber also said it will continue to force other disputes into arbitration, including when a passenger is injured due to driver negligence. Uber\u2019s reputation took a serious hit in the last several years after a series of public gaffes, reports of sexual assaults by drivers that were mishandled and a sexual harassment scandal that felled Uber\u2019s co-founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick.  In light of the numerous high-profile sexual harassment and assault cases across industries in recent months, West\u2019s post also references the Me Too movement and Time\u2019s Up, the coalition of women in Hollywood formed to fight sexual harassment. Uber announced that it created its new policy by consulting with women\u2019s groups and advisers including Tina Tchen, Michelle Obama\u2019s former chief-of-staff and one of the founders of the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund. This article has been updated to include additional comments from Lyft, Christensen and Carlson. "

Stewart, who is a member of the film festival\u2019s jury this year, posed for photographers while wearing a pair of Christian Louboutin stilettos. The actress then swiftly removed her shoes and walked the rest of the red carpet barefoot on her way to a screening of Spike Lee\u2019s film  BlacKkKlansman.  Stewart has not said whether she removed her shoes to protest the French festival\u2019s rule requiring women to don high heels, and her representatives did not return HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. But the star has spoken out in the past against what many consider an arcane dress code. At the 2016 festival, Stewart told Vanity Fair that the policy needed to change immediately.   If [a man and I] were walking the red carpet together and someone stopped me and said, \u2018Excuse me, young lady, you\u2019re not wearing heels. You cannot come in,\u2019 then [I\u2019m going to say], \u2018Neither is my friend. Does he have to wear heels?\u2019  she said at the time.  It can work both ways. It\u2019s just like you simply cannot ask me to do something that you are not asking him. I get the black-tie thing but you should be able to do either version \u2014 flats or heels.  That same year, Julia Roberts went barefoot on the Cannes red carpet. The high-profile rebellions against the dress code seem to stem from a 2015 incident when middle-aged women wearing rhinestone flats were turned away from a screening of the film  Carol.  The festival cited the  obligatory heels  policy in response to the outrage. "

Beitar declared in a Facebook post that it was making the move to honor President Donald Trump for recognizing Jerusalem as the capital city and moving the U.S. embassy there. The embassy was scheduled to open Monday, sparking fierce protests. Previous U.S. administrations have kept the embassy in Tel Aviv in an attempt to keep peace efforts percolating, but Trump\u2019s shift has stirred resentment among Palestinians who hope to establish their own future capital in east Jerusalem.  The chairmen of the club, the owner Eli Tabib and the executive manager Eli Ohana have decided to add to the club\u2019s title the name of the American President who made history, and from now on will be called Beitar Trump Jerusalem. We have the greatest love for the president, and we will win,  the team\u2019s statement said, per The Jerusalem Post.  For 70 years, Jerusalem has been awaiting international recognition, until President Donald Trump, in a courageous move, recognized Jerusalem as the eternal capital of Israel. President Trump has shown courage and true love of the Israeli people and their capital, and these days other countries are following his lead in giving Jerusalem its rightful status.  The six-time league champion team has been penalized before because some fans have chanted anti-Arab and Muslim slogans during matches, CNN pointed out.

            "text": "Organizers of the prestigious Cannes Film Festival on Monday signed a pledge committing to policies promoting more gender parity, in response to activism from women in the film industry.  The world is no longer the same. We must examine our own practices, our habits and our history,  said festival head Thierry Fremaux, who has faced criticism for the annual event\u2019s inclusion of an abysmally low number of female-directed movies. The adoption of the pledge on Monday came two days after a powerful protest organized by a group of French filmmakers pushing for gender equality, 5050 by 2020. Hollywood\u2019s Times Up movement against workplace sexual harassment also advocated the commitment. The demonstration featured 82 women, led by the Cannes festival\u2019s jury president, actress Cate Blanchett. They marched along the festival\u2019s red carpet on Saturday night, symbolizing the number of movies directed or co-directed by women that have competed in the festival\u2019s main slate throughout its entire history. Since the festival began in 1946, 1,645 movies directed by men have been featured, according to data compiled by 5050 by 2020. Some of the movies were co-directed by multiple men, amounting to 1,688 male directors. The festival\u2019s gender equity pledge has three main components, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Festival organizers will release statistics on the gender breakdown of film submissions, be transparent about members of the festival\u2019s selection and programming committees, and will establish equal gender representation on the festival\u2019s executive board. The pledge also encourages festival organizers to develop goals  to achieve perfect parity.   While modest and incremental, the pledge could encourage larger, long-term changes, as film festivals like Cannes play an important role in championing emerging filmmakers and showcasing movies that go on to receive critical acclaim and awards recognition. Organizers of the pledge hope that other prominent film festivals adopt similar commitments. Leaders of this fall\u2019s Toronto Film Festival, which often marks the unofficial start of the movie awards season, have also promised to sign the pledge. CORRECTION: An earlier version misstated the number of films directed by men. "

A badly beaten Raquel Pennington can be hard telling handlers in her corner  I\u2019m done  and  I want to be done  after the fourth round of her bantamweight bout against Nunes in Rio de Janeiro on Saturday night. But the handlers appear to disregard her plea to throw in the towel.  No, no, no,  a coach can be heard saying. Then Pennington is told,  We\u2019ll recover later.  Pennington answered the bell for the fifth round, absorbing a flurry of punches before the referee stopped the match.  Check out the highlights beginning at 1:20 into the clip.  If she didn\u2019t have the right conditioning to fight, then the coach should have thrown in the towel for sure,  a triumphant Nunes said, per MMA Junkie.  I think my coach wouldn\u2019t let me go through that. It\u2019s sad. Everyone must be saying a lot of bad things about him on social media, but I really think she needs to surround herself with people who want the best for her so she can really evolve for her next fights. Unfortunately, tonight (the cornerman) failed.  The decision sparked online debate, but Pennington\u2019s fiancee, Tecia Torres, defended the move in an Instagram post.  Both us and our coaches agree with the decision made to go into the 5th round,  Torres wrote.  We know Raquel more than anyone else and know if we let her give up on herself going into the last round she would have always regretted it. She fought with heart and grit until the end.  UFC President Dana White did not immediately respond to a HuffPost request for comment. "

            "text": "Leaders in the Southern Baptist Convention are seeking to clear the air as a prominent Baptist\u2019s past remarks about women, abuse, and divorce come newly under scrutiny. Paige Patterson, president of Texas\u2019 Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and a major figure in America\u2019s largest Protestant denomination, admitted Thursday that his description of a teenage girl\u2019s body as  nice  in recently resurfaced footage of a 2014 sermon had  obviously been hurtful to women.   I wish to apologize to every woman who has been wounded by anything I have said that was inappropriate or that lacked clarity,  Patterson wrote in a statement on his seminary\u2019s website. In his 2014 talk, Patterson appeared to condone the objectification of a 16-year-old girl\u2019s body. To illustrate how God  beautifully and artistically  created women, he recalled a time when he saw  a very attractive  16-year-old walking by after he\u2019d preached at an event.  She was nice,  Patterson reminisced in the clip, remarking that another man had described her as  built.  On Thursday, Patterson apologized for his words.   Please forgive the failure to be as thoughtful and careful in my extemporaneous expression as I should have been,  the pastor wrote in his statement. Patterson\u2019s apology did not directly address another remark he\u2019s made that has been causing controversy within Southern Baptist circles. He was captured on tape in 2000 advising physically abused wives to avoid divorce whenever possible and to  be submissive in every way.  He\u2019s clarified since that he has counseled women to leave \u2015 albeit not to divorce \u2015 their abusive husbands.  In his apology, Patterson did not address the possibility of divorce as an option for women in abusive relationships. He did, however, explicitly condemn all forms of abuse.  I utterly reject any form of abuse in demeaning or threatening talk, in physical blows, or in forced sexual acts,  he wrote in his statement on Thursday.  There is no excuse for anyone to use intemperate language or to attempt to injure another person.  Patterson\u2019s earlier statements have caused some division within the denomination in recent weeks. Patterson is a prominent figure within the church. As a former president of the entire denomination, he\u2019s credited with leading it toward greater conservatism. Some Southern Baptists are calling for Patterson to resign from his seminary position and withdraw from other duties, such as delivering the sermon at the denomination\u2019s annual meeting in Dallas this June. A petition condemning Patterson\u2019s  damaging, sinful  comments has gathered over 3,000 signatures, mostly from evangelical women. Others are offering their support for Patterson. Female professors and students at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary say he has been a champion for women at their school.  Samuel Schmidt, a pastor from Kentucky and a graduate of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, has organized a petition to defend Patterson. He claims the leader is being targeted by a  witch-hunt  carried out by  culture warriors, for the sake of political correctness at the expense of the glory of the Gospel.  His letter supporting Patterson has gained over 450 signatures. Amid the tension, Steve Gaines, current president of the Southern Baptist Convention, released a statement on Friday about Patterson. Gaines said he disagreed with the advice Patterson gave abused women (although he also did not address the possibility of divorce). Gaines also said he felt Patterson\u2019s remarks about the teenage girl\u2019s body were  improper.  He asked for forgiveness from women who have been hurt by Patterson\u2019s comments and called on all Southern Baptists to pray for the church. He encouraged them to speak  positively and constructively  about the issue online.  Every word we speak, in private or public conversation, even on social media, should be Christlike and filled with grace,  Gaines wrote in his statement.  Far better to be wronged than to participate in an ungodly exchange of words before a lost world that is listening and watching.  Karen Swallow Prior, a professor of English at the evangelical Christian Liberty University, was one of the Southern Baptist women who signed the petition denouncing Patterson\u2019s past remarks. She told HuffPost that Patterson\u2019s apology appeared to be a step in the right direction. However, she said, repentance is shown  not through words, but through actions.  Prior said she is waiting to see whether Patterson\u2019s seminary will take a stand on the issue. The seminary\u2019s board of trustees is scheduled to meet on May 22 in light of recent events.  This situation is not just about one man. The power of this one man depends upon the support of many men,  Prior wrote in an email.  The leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention are at a crossroads. The way they deal with this situation going forward will proclaim to the church and the world how they think women should be treated.  "

            "text": "Sophia started using Uber soon after it was founded in 2009. She doesn\u2019t even remember agreeing to, much less reading, the fine print in the app\u2019s terms of service. This would only become important in hindsight. Last December, the 26-year-old San Francisco Bay Area native took her final Uber ride. It should\u2019ve been a forgettable 12-minute trip from her company\u2019s holiday party to her home, but it turned into something terrible. When the car pulled up in front of her apartment building, Sophia\u2019s driver asked if he could walk her inside. She said no. Then, just as she was keying in the code to open the front door, he snuck up behind her, pushing her into the foyer. He grabbed her up into a bear hug and groped her. She got away, briefly, fleeing up the stairs to her apartment. He followed. In front of her apartment door, he again squeezed her tightly, putting his hand up her dress. Luckily, she made it inside her apartment and locked him out.  Later, after reporting her assault to the police, Sophia learned that her driver was a registered sex offender. How could Uber have allowed this man to drive for the company? she wondered. Sophia, who does not want to publicly reveal her last name, is one of nine women suing Uber for fraud, misleading advertising about its level of safety, and assault, battery and rape. The women are demanding that the ride-sharing company truly reckon with what they say is a widespread sexual assault issue.  The details of Sophia\u2019s attack are documented in the lawsuit, where she is identified as Jane Doe #3. The case was filed in 2017 and updated in March when Sophia and six other women joined the suit.  While a few of the other women suing have shared their stories publicly, Sophia is only now coming forward to HuffPost to share her experiences. The women want Uber to fix what they see as its  flawed  background check system, the lawsuit says. Because the system is designed to quickly approve drivers, Uber skips steps that would screen out sex offenders like the one who assaulted Sophia, according to the suit. Though Uber has recently announced changes to its system, these women say they\u2019re insufficient. The women say the only way they can force Uber to improve its standards is if they bring their case into a public courtroom \u2015 and this highlights a second, possibly even larger issue with Uber: When users download the app, they unwittingly click away their right to file a lawsuit against the company. Uber\u2019s terms of service, which, let\u2019s admit, most people don\u2019t read, require all customers to settle disputes \u2015 even over sexual assault and rape \u2015 in arbitration. These are private courtrooms, outside the public justice system, that notoriously favor big companies.  Uber has already filed a motion in court arguing that these women have no right to make their case in a public courtroom. That spurred action from the nine women and a few others, who penned an open letter to the company\u2019s board of directors urging Uber to reconsider.   Secret arbitration takes away a woman\u2019s right to a trial by a jury of her peers and provides a dark alley for Uber to hide from the justice system, the media and public scrutiny,  the women wrote. Uber defended its use of arbitration in a statement in March when the case expanded, but has since changed its tune somewhat. During a Twitter exchange with Susan Fowler, a former Uber employee who famously shared her story of workplace sexual harassment and discrimination, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said he would look at the issue.  Sexual assault has no place anywhere and we are committed to doing our part to help end this violence,  the company told HuffPost in a statement.  As we prioritize safety at Uber, we are taking a hard look at these important issues.  In arbitration, each woman would have to fight her case alone, on an individual level. The best outcome would be, maybe, a cash settlement. Often, such settlements are kept private through nondisclosure agreements, so other assault victims wouldn\u2019t learn about women who\u2019ve gone through similar experiences. The chances that the company would be forced to re-examine the way it does business are nil. Sophia told HuffPost she\u2019s not doing this for money, but to effect change.  The only thing I can really do is help others,  she said.  I think it\u2019s stronger to join others so we can help others not have this happen to them.  Publicly embarrassed by the letter \u2015 with Khosrowshahi getting called out on Twitter \u2015 the company asked for more time from the court to consider the women\u2019s plea. Uber now has a court-sanctioned deadline of May 17 to formally decide if its sexual assault issues get a public airing out. At a time when women are increasingly unwilling to stay silent about sexual abuse, the idea that a company can keep its problems private through arbitration has become harder to defend.  There are bills at both the federal and state level to stop companies from forcing women into arbitration in sexual harassment and assault cases. Microsoft announced earlier this year that it would no longer force harassment cases filed by its employees into arbitration. Orrick, a major law firm, made a similar announcement in March. Uber has said it has no issue with these women telling their stories in public. But news stories alone can\u2019t always bring justice or closure to victims. There\u2019s a particular power in letting rape survivors bring their stories into a public courtroom \u2015 and to have other women join them and say  me too.  Anyone who watched the victims of Larry Nassar confront their disgraced abuser in a Michigan courtroom in January knows this. We saw the power of a public trial again in the Bill Cosby case.   Having public disclosure in a courtroom about what happened, that\u2019s part of the public record. There\u2019s a real power in that,  said Hannah Brenner, a professor at California Western School of Law who researches the intersection of law and gender, focusing specifically on sexual assault, institutions and disparate power dynamics.  That these women have banded together is particularly powerful.  There\u2019s a tendency for us to dismiss sexual violence as a one-off,  Brenner said. Collectively, these women are a force more difficult to ignore. Citing hundreds of media reports about Uber-related sexual assault, the women suing the company say it has a systemic problem on its hands.  Jeanne Christensen, the lawyer representing the nine women, has been representing rape and assault victims in cases against Uber since at least 2014. She\u2019s negotiated privately with Uber, case by case, but said that last year she grew fed up with the one-off system and became determined to push the company to do more.  The stories are always the same,  she told HuffPost. Christensen\u2019s clients typically said they hailed an Uber ride after a night of drinking, and that their driver then assaulted and, in some cases, raped them. She couldn\u2019t go into more detail, citing confidentiality. Many of her clients are living in fear, she said, afraid their attacker will come after them again.  It\u2019s very common for clients to move apartments. They break leases. That\u2019s how frightened they are,  she said.  They get new phones, change their numbers.  Yet it\u2019s hard to know the real scope of Uber\u2019s sexual assault problems. The company does not release information about reported incidents, police departments don\u2019t track rape data that way \u2015 and sadly, most women do not report sexual assault to anyone at all. The company said it is looking at ways to better track assaults. While rapes and assaults that take place in Uber cars do get a lot of media attention, they are just a small percentage of sexual assaults in the U.S. Strangers aren\u2019t the biggest danger when it comes to rape.  While the Uber assaults are scary, women are still most at risk of being assaulted by someone they know,  said Melissa Morabito, a professor at the School of Criminology and Justice Studies, Center for Women & Work, at the University of Massachusetts Lowell.  Earlier this spring, Uber announced a host of changes meant to strengthen its background check process for drivers, as well as several new safety features. And Khosrowshahi has said publicly that safety is his No. 1 priority. The Uber app will now be better integrated with 911, making it easier for emergency services to find you on the road. The company said it would re-run background checks on all drivers each year to make sure no new incidents have cropped up \u2015 something it did inconsistently in the past. Uber also said it would begin using a technology that would alert them when Uber drivers were arrested in real time. The company  offers features that ensure every trip is GPS tracked, 24/7 response from our safety team, and the ability to share your trip with loved ones in real time, and we\u2019re committed to doing more,  it said in a statement. Uber also announced it was bringing on former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson as chairman of Uber\u2019s safety advisory board. But Christensen says these moves are not enough. Uber\u2019s checking process isn\u2019t much different than the credit check you\u2019d have to go through if you were trying to rent an apartment, she told HuffPost. The check only goes back seven years, according to the women\u2019s lawsuit. (Uber says that its checks can extend beyond that period depending on the database the company is searching.) The company needs to run driver\u2019s fingerprints through the FBI and Department of Justice\u2019s databases, the suit says.  Uber says that the fingerprint system is not a panacea and comes with its own set of flaws. There are concerns, for example, that some people \u2015 who haven\u2019t been convicted or who\u2019ve had their charges dismissed \u2015 get inaccurately labeled as criminals. The company cites data that show hundreds of thousands of Americans can\u2019t get jobs because of flaws and inaccuracies in the system. Uber argues that  While no background check is perfect, our process is robust, fair and relevant to the work at hand.   The predominance of regulators believe that our screening processes are appropriate,  Khosrowshahi told The Washington Post recently.  I don\u2019t think fingerprints would substantially change what happens with human behavior. \u2026 The predators in life look for dark corners. Our job is to tell the world that Uber has its lights on.   Sexual assault is about a predator stealing a part of you that you will never get back. I fight unceasingly against the shame, the loss of feeling safe, and the debilitating anxiety,  Sophia wrote in a statement she shared with HuffPost (read it in full below).  If Uber had done their due diligence, my devastation could have been avoided.  For now, Sophia is trying to find another place to live. She will only stay the night at home if her roommates are around, she said. She fears that the Uber driver who assaulted her might come look for her again.  Sophia fought her attacker off that December night in a struggle that lasted minutes, but that she said felt infinite.  I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever been in a car accident where time is moving extremely slow. You\u2019re trying to make the best decisions you possibly can, but if you\u2019re in the state too long, your brain can\u2019t handle it,  Sophia told HuffPost.  You\u2019re in a constant state of panic. It\u2019s like going in and out of consciousness.  She said she punched the Uber driver in the stomach and ran into her apartment, locking the door and windows. The morning after the attack, she opened her Uber app and reported the incident.  I think I was still in shock. I didn\u2019t think about the right way to do this,  Sophia said. She figured since she had a problem with the service, she should start there.  It seemed like the right move. Very quickly I realized it was not the right move.  A customer service rep called Sophia back and she told the woman what happened.  She said she\u2019d reimburse me for the ride and that they take this seriously and she\u2019d follow up again soon. It was a very short call,  Sophia said, estimating that the conversation probably took less than five minutes. The representative wasn\u2019t particularly empathetic. Sophia compared her demeanor to that of a barista taking your coffee order.  My $17 back was just not what I was going for. It didn\u2019t make me feel safer; that was the main thing,  she said.  I didn\u2019t feel any safer, and it was a pointless call.  Sophia walked to her local police department after that. The cops talked to her for hours, she said. Uber eventually got back to her and told her that her driver was no longer working for the company and that he\u2019d been warned by the police not to come near her.  I don\u2019t know what happened to him,  she said. The company didn\u2019t respond to specific questions about Sophia\u2019s allegations. Sophia doesn\u2019t use the Uber app anymore, but said that living in San Francisco, it\u2019s impossible not to be reminded of the service every day.  Every time I have a noxious reaction,  she said, adding that she now feels like she had blinders on when it came to using the app. She figured Uber was a strong business and had naturally figured this safety thing out, she said.   I got a little bit fooled by that. I didn\u2019t think enough through about what they were doing. I don\u2019t think they did either.   Read Sophia\u2019s full statement below. Sexual Assault is about a predator stealing a part of you that you will never get back. There is no settlement amount or number of criminal convictions that can replace what has forever been lost. To me, this is the most painful aspect of being a sexual assault survivor. I\u2019ve been given a life-sentence of battling the excruciating psychological effects of being violated; I fight unceasingly against the shame, the loss of feeling safe, and the debilitating anxiety. While I am strong and resilient, while I do not want to victimize myself, I want to be transparent and honest about the reality of surviving trauma, as I do not know how else to protect others. This story has been updated to include more information from Uber on how far back its driver background checks extend. Need help?

            "text": "SEATTLE \u2015 The 9:30 a.m. meeting of the Seattle City Council\u2019s Finance and Neighborhoods Committee \u2015 the most boring name imaginable \u2015 was overflowing. People in the crowd held up signs:  Don\u2019t vote our jobs away  or  Tax the rich.  The committee was taking public comment on the proposed Progressive Tax on Business, a fee on Seattle\u2019s largest corporations to support homeless services. Last week, Amazon \u2014 the employer of more than 45,000 Seattleites that is on the hook for an estimated $20 million under the tax \u2014 announced it was pausing construction planning on a tower downtown and would consider renting some of its office space to other companies if the fee goes through. Now the mayor and City Council have to decide whether to take this threat seriously. About a third of the attendees at Wednesday\u2019s hearing were wearing construction vests. One of them told committee members that if the tax passes, workers will have to go home, look their kids in the eye and tell them Daddy doesn\u2019t have a job anymore. Another called a member of the City Council a communist (she\u2019s actually a socialist) and said she  seems to be getting paid by the residents of Seattle to throw temper tantrums.   The applause in the room was deafening.  But the fight is about more than just one company or one policy. It is about the growing challenge of running American cities and all the ways companies make it even harder. Seattle faces an impossible choice: Either raise revenue from employers and risk driving them away, or keep levying taxes on voters and risk a backlash that could exacerbate the very problem it\u2019s trying to solve. Whatever happens here, it will be a template for the rest of the country.  The details of Seattle\u2019s proposed tax are crucial to understanding why Amazon hates it so much. Under the current proposal, the city will charge large companies 26 cents for every hour their employees work. That\u2019s about $520 per worker every year. Though the tax will apply only to companies with more than $20 million in revenue per year, or about 3 percent of Seattle businesses, Amazon employs about 145,000 people. And that structure is only temporary. The tax is flat for the first three years: The same fee is levied on wages whether an employee earns $31,200 a year (the minimum wage here) or more than $100,000 (what many Amazon corporate employees make). But in 2021, the flat fee becomes a payroll tax. Large companies will have to pay 0.7 percent of their employees\u2019 wages \u2014 that\u2019s $220 per year for minimum wage workers and more than $700 for Amazon\u2019s corporate employees. It\u2019s the second part, bigger taxes for bigger incomes, that seems to worry the companies here. A few days after Amazon\u2019s announcement, the CEO of Seattle-based Zillow made the same taking-our-ball-and-going-home threat, calling the tax  misguided and too blunt of an instrument.   But you can\u2019t talk about where the money comes from without talking about where it\u2019s going. Homelessness is an emergency in Seattle. Literally. In 2015, the mayor issued an emergency proclamation over the sheer number of people sleeping outside and in their cars and overflowing from shelters. At last count, Seattle had 11,643 homeless people, and its home of King County had the third-highest homeless concentration in the nation. A study last year by Zillow estimated that every 5 percent rise in Seattle rents pushed 258 more people into homelessness. Rents here rose 13.5 percent last year alone.  The proposed tax would raise about $75 million per year to help address this crisis, bringing the city\u2019s total homelessness budget up to $200 million. Three-quarters of the revenue would go toward building affordable housing and a smaller chunk would go toward direct, immediate services \u2014 things like temporary shelters,  hygiene centers  and shelter beds.   This isn\u2019t about Amazon,  said Lisa Herbold, a Seattle City Council member and a co-sponsor of the tax.  It\u2019s about the humanitarian crisis in our city.  It\u2019s clear that Seattle\u2019s tax is going to piss off Amazon. The question is, how much? Everything the company has said so far has been pretty tepid. Amazon has not, in fact, stopped construction on any downtown towers. It has stopped planning future construction, a much different (and less costly) decision. Similarly, the company announced it was exploring the option of subleasing some floors in one of its already-under-construction office buildings. That doesn\u2019t mean Amazon is crying wolf, but it does mean there\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty about the company\u2019s response. Even if members of the Seattle City Council approve the tax \u2014 hell, even if they triple it \u2014 Washington is still a relatively cheap place to do business. It has no income tax (which is effectively a pay raise for Amazon employees who move here from elsewhere), no capital gains tax and no corporate income tax. The city even passed an almost identical tax on employees, albeit at a much lower rate, in 2006 before repealing it during the recession.  Then there\u2019s the public relations aspect to consider. Though it will grow after 2021, Amazon\u2019s tax bill under the law will be pocket change compared with its $1.6 billion in profits last quarter alone. Moving employees, halting construction and reversing course all have costs, too.  Plus, does a not-super-popular corporate behemoth really want to pull thousands of jobs out of a city over being asked to fund services for the homeless? While Amazon is less reputation-conscious and less likely to be harmed by a boycott than a lot of companies are, its executives must know that throwing a hissy fit over this law would create some backlash. Amazon could still pull jobs out of Seattle anyway. The only thing CEO Jeff Bezos loves more than expanding his company is hating taxes. When a handful of states tried passing laws requiring internet retailers to collect sales tax in 2012, his vice president for global public policy called the efforts  unconstitutional.   A few years ago, Amazon halted plans to build a warehouse in South Carolina when local lawmakers wouldn\u2019t grant an exemption to the state sales tax. Bezos even reportedly considered incorporating his company on a Native American reservation to avoid taxes. Just because leaving Seattle over a small tax increase would be bananas doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t happen. In the past five years, Seattle has seen unprecedented growth, much of it driven by Amazon and other large companies. That has put unbearable strain on the housing market, schools and infrastructure. As the bill for services has grown, the way the city pays for them has become increasingly unjust. Washington has the most regressive tax structure in the country. The poorest 20 percent of residents pay an average of 16.8 percent of their income in state taxes. The richest 1 percent pay just 2.4 percent. This means low-income people are effectively paying for the city\u2019s growth. And yet, nearly every route to fixing Seattle\u2019s tax and revenue mess is blocked. The most obvious fix, an income tax, is illegal under the state constitution (or at least the way the state Supreme Court interpreted the constitution in 1951). Last year, the City Council passed a  high earners tax,  but a lawsuit preventing its implementation was filed about 10 minutes later. Alongside the (high and regressive) sales tax, Seattle relies heavily on property taxes. But, thanks to a 2001 ballot initiative, those revenues aren\u2019t allowed to grow by more than 1 percent per year. Everything the city needs (libraries, fire stations, schools) has to be individually approved by voters. Though Seattle\u2019s property taxes are below average compared with other cities, the constant levies and add-ons contribute to a sense among Seattleites that the city is squeezing them for more money every year without keeping up its end of the bargain. Homelessness is the perfect encapsulation of this dynamic. As the city has grown, it\u2019s nearly doubled its budget for homeless services. In 2016, voters approved a $290 million affordable housing levy. The city is getting more people into permanent housing than ever before.  But living here, it is immediately and viscerally clear that these efforts aren\u2019t enough. Rising rents are pushing people onto the streets faster than the city can bring them back inside. Nearly half of the city\u2019s homeless population is now unsheltered. Last year, a record 169 people died sleeping on the street, and the city is already on track to break the record again.   Seattle\u2019s current situation exposes a fundamental challenge for lawmakers across the country: Solving big problems requires bold, transformational policies. What city leaders can pass in the face of structural barriers and skeptical voters, however, are merely small, incremental improvements to the status quo. And that\u2019s exactly what the Progressive Tax on Business is: a half-measure. No matter what Amazon decides to do, taxing employment, just like taxing cigarette purchases, will result in less of it. And the new tax probably won\u2019t result in a significant reduction in the city\u2019s homeless population. The city estimates the tax will produce 1,780 units of affordable housing, even though its own resolution says it needs more than 17,000.  None of that is an argument against the tax. As council member Herbold points out, this may be Seattle\u2019s only available route toward making its tax code more progressive. Despite the fireworks at public hearings, the tax is relatively modest and is specifically tailored to affect only the companies that can afford it. Nor is it the only tax of its kind: Wilmington, Delaware; Denver; and plenty of other cities tax companies on the number of employees they have, a so-called head tax.  This week, as Seattle debated the $75 million head tax, the Chamber of Commerce released a report estimating that solving homelessness would cost $400 million. A proposal by the mayor to reduce the revenue to $40 million triggered an even more raucous committee hearing, with protesters chanting  $75 million, no extortion!  to another packed audience. The original proposal passed and will be voted on Monday, but the mayor could still veto it.  But that is the debate here, what has become possible and necessary to the city to fight over: Whether to spend 10 percent of what it will cost to solve homelessness or 20 percent.  But the bigger question is how cities should respond to threats like Amazon\u2019s.  The request for proposals for the company\u2019s second headquarters stated explicitly that  a stable and business-friendly environment and tax structure will be high-priority considerations.  Cities responded in kind: Chula Vista, California, offered free land. Fresno, California, offered control over how municipal revenues would be spent. Chicago even offered to waive income taxes for Amazon employees.  The calculation these cities are making is all about the multiplier: Every job created by Amazon creates another 1.5 in  indirect employment  \u2014 consultants, chefs, schoolteachers. Except those employers won\u2019t get any of the tax breaks. Perversely, it\u2019s only the largest companies, the ones with the most power and the littlest need for unfair advantages, who get cities falling all over themselves to give away revenues.  It\u2019s not even clear what Seattle gave up to entice Amazon\u2019s most recent expansion here. The company didn\u2019t respond to inquiries about how many employees it has in Seattle or how much it pays in city and state taxes (though late last week,  a person at the company familiar with the data  made a  rare disclosure  to The Seattle Times that Amazon had paid $250 million in local taxes \u2014 without specifying what types of taxes or where they went). No matter where they operate, companies have every incentive to play exactly the game Amazon is playing. To shareholders, every dollar a company pays in tax is waste. The minute Amazon announces its second headquarters location, it can start pitting its host cities against each other: Hey Seattle, we\u2019re thinking of adding another 1,000 jobs. It\u2019s you or Pittsburgh. What are you going to give us? This is, in fact, almost exactly what the CEO of Zillow warned this week.  We are actively trying to decide where to put the next couple hundred heads, and this is the type of thing that causes us to consider looking at putting that expansion in other cities,  he said. The challenge of finding enough revenue to adequately run a city is only going to get worse. Excluding health care, federal grants to cities are at their lowest since 1980. Despite the growing economy, 30 states have revenue shortfalls. The Trump administration has declared its intention to cut transportation funding and housing assistance. Without outside support, cities will become increasingly reliant on revenues from their own voters and their largest employers.  Seattle is a case study for what those fights are going to look like. The more desperate cities become, the more leverage corporations will wield over them. And, simultaneously, the more frustrated their populations will get at the constant tax raises and fee hikes.  The most depressingly insightful comment from Wednesday\u2019s City Council hearing came from Howard Bess, a counselor for the Downtown Emergency Service Center, a homeless shelter in Seattle. He apologized for being tired; he had been up all night helping Seattle\u2019s homeless population find an  island of relief.   I don\u2019t see that anybody who is opposing this is going to die on the streets,  he said,  or not be able to pay their mortgage or not be able to wear new shoes or clean clothes. But our clients could certainly use that help.   The applause for him was even louder.  "

            "text": "Eighty-two women including Cate Blanchett and Ava DuVernay marched up the red carpet at the Cannes Film Festival on Saturday to protest gender inequality at the festival and in the wider film industry. Members of the group included actresses, directors and other women in the film industry, including Kristen Stewart, Salma Hayek and  Wonder Woman  director Patty Jenkins, The Associated Press reports. Blanchett, the jury president of this year\u2019s festival, led the group and read out a statement from the steps of the Palais des Festivals, joined by French film director Agnes Varda, who read the statement in French. In her remarks, Blanchett explained the significance of the number 82.  On these steps today stand 82 women representing the number of female directors who have climbed these stairs since the first edition of the Cannes Film Festival in 1946,  she said, according to The Hollywood Reporter.  In the same period 1688 male directors have climbed these very same stairs. In the 71 years of this world-renowned festival there have been 12 female heads of its juries.  She added that 71 male directors have received the Palme d\u2019Or, the most prestigious award of the festival. Only one female director, Jane Campion in 1993, has received the Palme d\u2019Or, though Varda won an honorary Palme d\u2019Or in 2015.  Women are not a minority in the world, yet the current state of the industry says otherwise,  Blanchett said.  We stand together on these steps today as a symbol of our determination to change and progress.  The march was planned by 5050 by 2020, a French movement dedicated to gender equality in film. The statement coincides with the Cannes Film Festival\u2019s announcement that it will be signing  concrete, strong commitments  to diversity on Monday, Deadline reports, though it\u2019s not clear what exactly those commitments will be.

            "text": "Cornell University student Letitia Chai stripped down to her underwear while delivering a presentation this week after a professor reportedly told her that her shorts were  too short  just days earlier. About two dozen of Chai\u2019s fellow students joined in.  This topic transcends all of our social identities and taps right into the heart of who we are,  Chai, a fourth-year student, said to a room of nearly 50 people while presenting her thesis paper on May 5, as seen in a livestream of the event. Chai began undressing as she held back tears, first removing her shoes, then her pants and, lastly, her shirt.  I am more than Asian. I am more than a woman. I am more than Letitia Chai. I am a human being,  she said while undressing.  And I ask you to take this leap of faith, to take this next step, or rather this next strip, in our movement and to join me in revealing to each other and to seeing each other for who we truly are \u2014 members of the human race.   Then 28 of the 44 people in the room also took off their clothes, The Cornell Sun reported. Although Chai\u2019s protest happened last week, her story didn\u2019t hit national news until Thursday.   The protest came just days after Chai was presenting a trial run of her thesis in her class  Acting in Public: Performance in Everyday Life  on May 2. When Chai went to give her trial run presentation, professor Rebekah Maggor questioned the student\u2019s outfit choice.    Is that really what you would wear?  Maggor asked Chai, according to a Facebook post the student wrote later that day. Chai, who was wearing a long-sleeve button-down shirt and jean cutoff shorts, said she was  shook  by Maggor\u2019s alleged comments.   The professor proceeded to tell me, in front of my whole class, that I was inviting the male gaze away from the content of my presentation and onto my body,  she wrote on Facebook, noting that her professor is a white woman.  She said I was making a statement by wearing my outfit. I told her that I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t change my statement to make her or anyone else feel more comfortable.  According to Chai, a male international student then made a comment that a presenter has a  moral obligation  to the audience to dress conservatively, at which point Chai fled the room in tears.   I am not responsible for anyone\u2019s attention because we are capable of thinking for ourselves and we have agency,  Chai told The Cornell Sun, referring to Maggor\u2019s alleged comments that her outfit would invite the wrong type of attention.  Maggor responded to Chai\u2019s protest in an email to the Sun.   I do not tell my students what to wear, nor do I define for them what constitutes appropriate dress,  she said.  I ask them to reflect for themselves and make their own decisions.  After Chai gathered herself, she came back into the classroom, stripped down to her underwear and gave her full thesis presentation. In a Facebook post, Chai said she would do the same for her actual thesis presentation and encouraged others to attend and do the same. According to a statement written by 11 of the other 13 students in Maggor\u2019s class that day, the situation may have gone down a bit differently than Chai wrote on Facebook. They wrote that while Maggor made  an error in phrasing,  she had  apologized on more than one occasion.  The students added that Chai\u2019s post did not  adequately represent [Maggor\u2019s] past and continued advocacy for women and minorities.    Our intention in writing this letter is in no way to invalidate any of Letitia\u2019s experience,  the statement reads.  We strongly support and identify with Letitia\u2019s fight for equality ... The majority of us are students of color, from multi-ethnic backgrounds, who very much relate to Letitia\u2019s frustration with systemic oppression that is part of the fabric of this country. We do not want to discredit her narrative. However, we feel it is important and our obligation to share our impression of Wednesday\u2019s events to provide a fair representation of the situation.  Below is an excerpt from the students\u2019 statement detailing how the conversation in question happened (scroll below to read the letter in full): Letitia stood up to give her speech. Before she began, our professor asked Letitia if she would wear  those shorts  to her actual presentation on Saturday. Our professor regularly asks all of the students, male and female, such questions to clarify appropriate attire for public speaking. Our professor went on to say that what you wear and how you present yourself make a statement. She noted that if you were to wear jean shorts to your thesis presentation, that is a statement. Her focus on attire was a means of noting the importance of professionalism in certain public speaking situations. Maggor was unable to provide additional comment at press time, and Chai has not responded to a request for comment. In her original Facebook post, Chai wrote why she chose to protest Maggor\u2019s comments and the larger issue of policing people\u2019s bodies.   This is for every Asian woman who was told to speak up lest others think she\u2019s submissive,  she wrote.  This is for every POC man who was told to pull his pants to be taken seriously, and every POC woman who was asked to straighten her hair to seem intelligent. This is for every gay friend who was told to dress more \u2018straight\u2019 so that others didn\u2019t feel weird around him/her/them. This is for us.  Read the full statement from 11 of the other 13 students in Chai\u2019s class below.  Head over to The Cornell Sun to read more about this story.  "

You are trash and we do not need you,  the comedian said on Wednesday\u2019s episode of  Full Frontal.   Now, Schneiderman was a guest on my show, so this is a little complicated for me to talk about,  said Bee, in reference to her calling him  a hero  for standing up to  democracy\u2019s nemesis  in a November broadcast.  Just kidding, it\u2019s not complicated,  she added.  Fuck you, Eric Schneiderman!  Bee later  checked in  on other  penis weasels  who have been accused of sexual abuse and harassment since the #MeToo movement gained traction, including news anchor Charlie Rose and movie producer Harvey Weinstein. The YouTube clip of Bee\u2019s November interview with Schneiderman has been renamed to:  Former AG Tricks Sam Into Thinking He Was Decent.   We taped this segment before the allegations against Eric Schneiderman came to light, and we sincerely apologize for characterizing him as a hero when, to so many women, he was the vilest villain,  its description now reads.

            "text": "New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo assigned a special prosecutor to investigate allegations that former state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman physically abused multiple women, according to a statement released Tuesday. A New Yorker article published on Monday detailed the stories of four women who accused Schneiderman of abusing them, including slapping and choking them. Cuomo appointed Nassau District Attorney Madeline Singas as the special prosecutor tasked with investigating the allegations and whether any resources or staff members from the attorney general\u2019s office facilitated the reported abuse.  A statement from the governor\u2019s office emphasized that the integrity of the justice system is of  paramount importance.  Cuomo also referenced the need for Singas\u2019 inquiry as the attorney general\u2019s office has an open investigation into the sexual abuse allegations against former Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.  There can be no suggestion of any possibility of the reality or appearance of any conflict or anything less than a full, complete and unbiased investigation,  the statement given to the Times said.  The victims deserve nothing less.   Schneiderman\u2019s accusers say he assaulted them without their consent during sexual encounters. Two of the women, Michelle Manning Barish and Tanya Selvaratnam, told The New Yorker that Schneiderman, 63,  repeatedly hit them, often after drinking, frequently in bed and never with their consent,  forcing them to seek medical attention. The former attorney general denied the accusations to The New Yorker but resigned shortly after the article went public on Monday.   It has been my great honor and privilege to serve as Attorney General for the people of the State of New York,  Schneiderman said in a statement late Monday.  In the last several hours, serious allegations, which I strongly contest, have been made against me. While these allegations are unrelated to my professional conduct or the operations of the office, they will effectively prevent me from leading the office\u2019s work at this critical time.  "
