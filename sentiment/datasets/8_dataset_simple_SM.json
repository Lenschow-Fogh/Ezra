Fragrant soaps and lotions People with eczema should avoid covering their bodies with fragrance says board certified dermatologist Dr Adrienne Haughton the assistant vice chairman and associate program director of the Department of Dermatology SUNY at Stonybrook ", "Therefore all of the fragrant body washes from places like Bath Body Works should be avoided she says ", "But she adds if you have to have signature scent it far better to use fragrance spray that you can spritz directly on your clothes rather than your body ", " Household irritants This is especially important if you have kiddos who have the rash as they could accidentally come into contact with these items ", "Dr Haughton cautions against irritants like cleaning products and detergents which have harsh chemicals fragrances and acidic pH levels that when in contact with your skin can cause different reactions but if you have eczema they can inflame an already aggravated rash ", " Harsh beauty products Pay special attention to what you use on your face ", "For example Many anti aging products may be too irritating as well as makeup remover some sunscreens and acne products says Dr Haughton because of salicylic acid retinol and glycolic acid in these products that combat against oil meaning they will make your skin drier than it already is ", "Pets ", "Since eczema is thought to be an overactive immune system response and is often linked to other allergic reactions pet dander from both cats and dogs can contribute to flare ups ", " ", "Exercise ", "According to Dr Haughton chlorine and sweat are two triggers for eczema ", "After going swimming it might be good idea to at least rinse off your body and if you re heavy sweater pay special attention to areas like the insides of your elbows and the backs of your knees ", " dirty environment Like pets dust mites and mold also stimulate allergic reactions such as rashes and hives they can show up in carpets rugs curtains bathrooms and

comprised of fatty acids and found in your epidermis they contribute to the water repellant layer of your skin which helps protect you from external drying factors ", " Although many people haven heard of them they are the main ingredient in heavy duty moisturizers like CeraVe ", " Recommended Regimen ", "Here are some daily practices that will help keep your eczema at bay ", " Use lukewarm water You should avoid hot steaming showers says Dr Jaliman and Dr Haughton agrees listing steam as trigger ", "Although long hot shower can be very relaxing remember that this can irritate the skin

the wrong way ", " ", "Practice good hygiene overall Cleaning your body after long day is super beneficial as it will remove the bacteria that could be making your eczema worse ", "For example there are cases of eczema herpeticum which is viral infection that can be caused by poorly treated atopic dermatitis the typical rash you see if you have eczema ", " Eczema herpeticum involves lesions and boil like eruptions and if left untreated there can be some severe side effects such as blindness or death ", "Dr Haughton recommends that you seek medical attention immediately if you show symptoms such as boils on top of atopic eczema fever and swollen lymph nodes ", " Any patient with eczema herpeticum will need to be hospitalized for antiviral medications Dr Haughton says ", " ", "As mentioned try using lukewarm rather than hot water for showers ", "The same rules go for cleaning your face which both dermatologists say you should wash twice day ", " ", "Mind your towel manners After cleansing pat your skin dry says Dr Jaliman because the friction from the rubbing can cause additional irritation ", " Know when to apply ointments Dr Haughton recommends putting any topical prescription while the skin is still damp to the areas that are flaring she says adding that you should moisturize your entire body as final step ", " The goal is to trap in some of the moisture Dr Haughton says since the patches of rash caused by eczema dries out the skin and when good moisturizer is used like one with ceramides you ll have protective shield that will keep your skin hydrated
