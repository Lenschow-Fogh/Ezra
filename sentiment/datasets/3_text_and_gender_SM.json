      "text": "At least two organizations have decided to drop Morgan Freeman after eight women accused him of inappropriate behavior and sexual harassment. Women who previously worked with the Oscar-winning actor told CNN that he repeatedly made comments about their bodies or their clothing and frequently engaged in inappropriate touching. In response to the allegations, Visa announced it had suspended him from its marketing campaign.  We are aware of the allegations that have been made against Mr. Freeman. At this point, Visa will be suspending our marketing in which the actor is featured,  Visa said in a statement. TransLink, Vancouver\u2019s public transit system, also decided to stop using Freeman\u2019s voice as part of an ad campaign to promote its Visa credit card and mobile payments on bus and Skytrain operations.  In light of information we\u2019ve learned ... of allegations regarding actor Morgan Freeman, TransLink has decided to pause his voice announcements as part of a Visa ad campaign on our transit system,  the transit system said a statement.  We will be reaching out to Visa to discuss further.  A few hours after the report was released, Freeman, 80, issued an apology:  Anyone who knows me or has worked with me knows I am not someone who would intentionally offend or knowingly make anyone feel uneasy, I apologize to anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected \u2014 that was never my intent.  A production assistant working on the 2015 film  Going in Style  said Morgan made numerous comments about her body, asked her several times if she was wearing underwear and tried to lift her skirt. Another worker on the set said women wore loose-fitting clothing in an effort to avoid Freeman\u2019s attention. Entertainment Tonight released footage on Thursday evening of two on-air interviews with Freeman that also revealed his attitude toward women. During an interview for the 2016 film  London Has Fallen,  Freeman asked a young female reporter,  My goodness, are you married? Fool around with other guys? I\u2019m just asking.  In 2015, he told author Janet Mock:  You got a dress halfway between your knee and your hips, and you sit down right across from me and you cross your legs.  Mock, who was a special correspondent for the interview, said Freeman\u2019s treatment of her was an  exhibition of the casual nature at which men in positions of power believe that everything belongs to them, including women\u2019s bodies.  Freeman\u2019s union, SAG-AFTRA, is considering what to do about Freeman\u2019s Life Achievement Award. The award is given to actors who represent the  finest ideals of the acting profession,  CNN reported.  These are compelling and devastating allegations which are absolutely contrary to all the steps that we are taking to ensure a safe work environment,  the union said in a statement.  Any accused person has the right to due process, but it is our starting point to believe the courageous voices who come forward to report incidents of harassment ... we are reviewing what corrective actions may be warranted at this time.

      "text": "The best way to watch Harvey Weinstein walk himself into a Manhattan police precinct on Friday morning was via NBC News\u2019 Periscope. As the former Oscar-winning Hollywood producer and  king of indie film  marched from his black car into the police station, NBC correspondent Craig Melvin began naming some of the 95 women who have come forward with allegations against Weinstein \u2015 Lucia Evans, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Uma Thurman, Salma Hayek. Reaction icons started floating up the right side of the screen, little hearts of different colors, one after another after another, until they formed a cloud of  likes.  We, the people of the internet, were engaging in a collective act of schadenfreude, and it was delicious. Women are so often told to contain our anger, to make it more palatable, less  aggressive,  small enough to contain within the male prerogative. But I\u2019m angry at men like Harvey Weinstein, and there\u2019s nothing palatable about it.  The man who beckoned young women to his hotel rooms for the sole purpose of using them, who hired ex-Mossad agents to track anyone liable to expose him, who had vast resources at his fingertips and used them liberally to try to silence the dozens of women he (allegedly) victimized \u2015 even that man is no longer untouchable.  That man had to walk past reporters as he entered a police station, submitting to the cheap cop pornography of the perp walk. That man looked haggard and tilted his head low to avoid eyes and questions. That man also carried two books with him into the police station, biographies of Big Men in Show Biz \u2014 Elia Kazan, and Rodgers and Hammerstein \u2014 because he is, after all, exactly the kind of prick who fancies himself both a legend and a victim of a pious mob. That man was charged with rape, committing a criminal sex act, sexual abuse and sexual misconduct.  It is still shocking to see powerful men face criminal charges for harming women, and even more shocking to see them convicted. And the process leading up to that \u2015 the public offerings of private pain (hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers and hers \u2026), the scrutiny of that pain, the way it\u2019s picked apart and held up to the light and valued according to how neatly it can be added to a pile of other women\u2019s pain \u2015 is not a pretty one. The rapid rise of the Me Too movement has been exhilarating to witness but also exhausting.  There are few moments of relief when an eternity of systemic abuse is being unpacked and processed. When those moments do present themselves, your instinct is to seize them like a prize. Weinstein is the man behind some of the most recognizable films of my lifetime, but surely the footage many of us will most remember him for is Friday\u2019s walk. A big man in a blue sweater, displayed like any other perp for our delectation, tokens of self-pity and self-regard in the crook of his arm.  As Rose McGowan tweeted Friday morning:  We got you, Harvey Weinstein, we got you.  I hope all 95 women who have said Weinstein violated them saw the footage, and I hope they let themselves feel even a nanosecond of pleasure. When (some) men are (finally) held accountable for their abuses, it does not undo the pain and damage they\u2019ve wrought. But maybe, just maybe, it feels damn good to watch. "

      "text": "Multiple women have accused actor Morgan Freeman of inappropriate behavior and harassment. The allegations surfaced Thursday in a report from CNN, with eight individuals telling the network that they were victims of harassment and inappropriate behavior by Freeman. Sixteen people in total spoke to CNN about the actor\u2019s alleged behavior as part of the investigation. An unidentified woman told the network she was harassed by Freeman in 2015 while working as a production assistant for the comedy  Going in Style  starring the famed actor. The woman said Freeman often touched her inappropriately and made comments about her body and clothing daily. Freeman  kept trying to lift up my skirt and asking if I was wearing underwear  at one point while they worked together, the woman alleged. Actor Alan Arkin  made a comment telling him to stop. Morgan got freaked out and didn\u2019t know what to say.  Another woman told CNN that while working on the 2012 movie  Now You See Me,  Freeman sexually harassed her multiple times.  He did comment on our bodies,  the second accuser told CNN.  We knew that if he was coming by ... not to wear any top that would show our breasts, not to wear anything that would show our bottoms, meaning not wearing clothes that [were] fitted,  she said. Other inappropriate behavior included staring at women\u2019s breasts, massaging an intern\u2019s shoulders, asking a woman how she felt about sexual harassment and asking women to twirl for him, according to CNN. TransLink, Vancouver\u2019s major transportation company, said it would be suspending new voiceovers that featured Freeman as part of an ad campaign for Visa. In a statement, Freeman said he is not someone who would  intentionally offend.   Anyone who knows me or has worked with me knows I am not someone who would intentionally offend or knowingly make anyone feel uneasy,  he said.  I apologize to anyone who felt uncomfortable or disrespected \u2015 that was never my intent.  This has been updated with TransLink\u2019s response to the allegations.  "

      "text": "When it comes to New York Jets players kneeling during the national anthem, team chairman Christopher Johnson is a standup guy. Johnson said the team wouldn\u2019t fine any player for protesting, despite a new NFL owner-approved measure that enables teams to do so, according to reports. Wednesday\u2019s rule change says players must stand for the anthem or stay off the field. If any player kneels, his team would face a league fine. Teams can discipline individual players.  As I have in the past, I will support our players wherever we land as a team,  Johnson said in a statement, according to the New York Post.  Our focus is not on imposing any Club rules, fines, or restrictions. Instead we will continue to work closely with our players to constructively advance social justice issues that are important to us. I remain extremely proud of how we demonstrated unity last season as well as our players\u2019 commitment to strengthening our communities.  Johnson elaborated on his pledge not to fine players in an interview with Newsday.   I do not like imposing any club-specific rules,  he said.  If somebody (on the Jets) takes a knee, that fine will be borne by the organization, by me, not the players.  I never want to put restrictions on the speech of our players. Do I prefer they stand? Of course. But I understand if they feel the need to protest. There are some big, complicated issues that we\u2019re all struggling with, and our players are on the front lines.  Johnson\u2019s stance could get interesting in the team\u2019s hierarchy. He has been designated as the acting owner while his brother, team owner Woody Johnson, serves as President Donald Trump\u2019s ambassador to the United Kingdom, CBS Sports pointed out. Trump, who has repeatedly criticized demonstrating players, applauded the new NFL edict.  You have to stand proudly for the national anthem or you shouldn\u2019t be playing,  he said. The NFL Players Association criticized the league for failing to consult the union before the change, and vowed to carefully review the new policy. "

      "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Donald Trump administration has launched a national security investigation into car and truck imports that could lead to new U.S. tariffs similar to those imposed on imported steel and aluminum in March. The national security probe under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 would investigate whether vehicle and parts imports were threatening the industry\u2019s health and ability to research and develop new, advanced technologies, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday.  There is evidence suggesting that, for decades, imports from abroad have eroded our domestic auto industry,  Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement, promising a  thorough, fair and transparent investigation.  Higher tariffs could be particularly painful for Asian automakers including Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co, Honda Motor Co and Hyundai Motor Co, which count the United States as a key market, and the announcement sparked a broad sell-off in automakers\u2019 shares across the region.  The governments of Japan, China and South Korea said they would monitor the situation, while Beijing, which is increasingly eyeing the United States as a potential market for its cars, added that it would defend its interests.  China opposes the abuse of national security clauses, which will seriously damage multilateral trade systems and disrupt normal international trade order,  Gao Feng, spokesman at the Ministry of Commerce, said at a regular news briefing on Thursday which focused largely on whether Beijing and Washington are making any progress in their growing trade dispute.  We will closely monitor the situation under the U.S. probe and fully evaluate the possible impact and resolutely defend our own legitimate interests.  The probe comes as Trump courts voters in the U.S. industrial heartland ahead of mid-term elections later this year, and opens a new front in his  America First  trade agenda aimed at clawing back manufacturing jobs lost to overseas competitors. It could raise the costs for overseas automakers to export vehicles and parts to the world\u2019s second-largest auto market. Growing trade tensions over cars and car parts, particularly with China, could raise risks for U.S. companies expanding their presence in the country, signs of which are already emerging. Earlier this month, Reuters reported that Ford Motor Co\u2019s imported vehicles were being held up at Chinese ports, adding to a growing list of U.S. products facing issues at China\u2019s borders. The majority of vehicles sold in the United States by Japanese and South Korean automakers are produced there, but most firms also export to the U.S. from plants in Asia, Mexico, Canada and other countries. Roughly one-third of all U.S. vehicle imports last year were from Asia. In addition to recently imposed 25 percent tariffs on steel and 10 percent tariffs on aluminum imports, the administration has threatened tariffs on $50 billion worth of Chinese goods over intellectual property complaints, and Beijing has vowed to respond. The administration is also trying to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement to return more auto production to the United States. Commerce said the new probe would determine whether lost domestic production had weakened the U.S.  internal economy  and its ability to develop connected vehicle systems, autonomous vehicles, fuel cells, electric motors and batteries, and advanced manufacturing processes. In a separate statement, Trump said:  Core industries such as automobiles and automotive parts are critical to our strength as a Nation.  A Trump administration official said before the announcement that the expected move was aimed partly at pressuring Canada and Mexico to make concessions in talks to update the NAFTA that have languished in part over auto provisions, as well as pressuring Japan and the European Union, which also export large numbers of vehicles to the United States. An ad hoc industry group representing the largest Japanese, German and other foreign automakers called  Here for America,  criticized the effort.  To our knowledge, no one is asking for this protection. This path leads inevitably to fewer choices and higher prices for cars and trucks in America,  said John Bozzella, chief executive of Global Automakers, a trade group representing Toyota, Nissan Motor Co Ltd, Hyundai Motor Co and others. A Toyota spokeswoman said that the company was monitoring the situation. Chinese automaker Geely Holding Group urged free trade practices for the auto industry, which is built on a complex supply chain under which vehicle components for any given car often originates from numerous countries.  As a global manufacturer, Geely Holding Group is in favor of free trade and open markets. Free trade creates jobs, wealth and economic growth,  a spokesman said, adding that its plant in South Carolina to produce its Volvo brand cars showed its commitment to the country. Shares in Toyota, Honda and Hyundai each fell roughly 3 percent in local trade following the announcement, while Mazda Motor Corp, which does not have any U.S. production capacity at the moment, tumbled more than 5 percent. Late last week, Japan\u2019s automakers\u2019 association urged its export partners to keep tariffs on vehicles and components low and maintain free trade relationships. Roughly 12 million cars and trucks were produced in the United States last year, while the country imported 8.3 million vehicles worth $192 billion. This included 2.4 million from Mexico, 1.8 million from Canada, 1.7 million from Japan, 930,000 from South Korea and 500,000 from Germany, according to U.S. government statistics. At the same time, the United States exported nearly 2 million vehicles worldwide worth $57 billion. German automakers Volkswagen AG, Daimler AG and BMW AG all have large U.S. assembly plants. The United States is the second-biggest export destination for German auto manufacturers after China, while vehicles and car parts are Germany\u2019s biggest source of export income. Asked if the measures would hit Mexico and Canada, a Mexican source close to the NAFTA talks said:  That probably is going to be the next battle.

      "text": "President Donald Trump told reporters Thursday that he is pardoning late heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson, who was arrested in 1912 for driving his white girlfriend across state lines. Trump indicated last month he was considering pardoning the boxer at the urging of actor Sylvester Stallone, who was present at Thursday\u2019s announcement at the White House.  Johnson, the first black man to earn the title of heavyweight boxing champion of the world, died in 1946 after serving time for violating the Mann Act, which banned traveling with a woman across state lines for an  immoral purpose.   Johnson served 10 months in federal prison for what many view as a racially motivated injustice,  Trump said Thursday.  He was treated very rough, very tough.  The son of former slaves, Johnson gained fame and wealth through his boxing career despite rampant racism and violence against blacks at the time. Obama, however, kept to the presidential tradition of almost never granting a posthumous pardon.  "

      "text": "President Donald Trump vocalized his support for the National Football League\u2019s new rule that requires players to stand during the national anthem, telling Fox News that perhaps the players who refuse to abide  shouldn\u2019t be in the country.  The NFL approved the policy on Wednesday in a push to end kneeling during the anthem, which Colin Kaepernick began in 2016 football season as a silent protest in the face of rising racial violence and police brutality. The players not on board will have to stay in the locker room.  Trump praised the league for the new rule that would stop national anthem protests before they happen, saying NFL owners did the right thing.   I don\u2019t think people should be staying in locker rooms,  Trump told Fox News.  You have to stand proudly for the national anthem or you shouldn\u2019t be playing. You shouldn\u2019t be there. Maybe you shouldn\u2019t be in the country.  Trump has derided players and team owners for the kneeling protests on multiple occasions, sparking a debate as to whether the protests were disrespectful of the U.S. military or an expression of First Amendment rights.  NFL commissioner Roger Goodell addressed the controversy in a statement after the new rule was announced that  on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of NFL players were unpatriotic.  At an Alabama rally in September, Trump called players who kneeled a  son of a bitch  and encouraged fans to boycott games when the protests occurred. The president has continued to bring up the issue and alluded to it while welcoming NASCAR Champion Martin Truex Jr. to the White House on Monday.  And I will tell you one thing I know about NASCAR: They do indeed, Brian, stand for the playing of the national anthem, right?  Trump said on Monday.  They do indeed.  Others from the Trump administration have praised the NFL\u2019s rule change on Wednesday, including Vice President Mike Pence and the president\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr. Pence, who left an Indianapolis Colts game after players kneeled last year, posted a screenshot of the news and captioned it  #winning  on Twitter. Trump Jr. posted a similar tweet on Wednesday captioning an AP article with  STILL NOT SICK OF #WINNING!!!!   Despite the Trump administration\u2019s celebrations on Twitter, however, the rule may not be the end of kneeling protests.  The NFL Player\u2019s Association, which has supported the players\u2019 right to protest, issued a release on Wednesday stating it would review the new rule and challenge any aspect inconsistent with its collective bargaining agreement.   The NFL chose to not consult the union in the development of this \u2018policy,\u2019 the statement said.  NFL players have shown their patriotism through their social activism, their community service, in support of our military and law enforcement and yes, through their protests to raise awareness about the issues they care about.   Other Twitter users have noted that the NFL is made up of predominantly black athletes, who could decide to boycott the ruling together.   The NFL is about 70% black,  tweeted Dominque Hamilton, a former University of Missouri football player.  If united and didn\u2019t take the field at all, it would upset a lot of people and a lot of executives.  "

But Chastain is being a good sport about the bronze not-so-likeness that the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame dedicated to her on Monday, which some Twitter wags suggested bears more of a resemblance to actors Mickey Rooney or Gary Busey:  It\u2019s not the most flattering,  Chastain said, somewhat diplomatically, at the presentation, adding it was  nice.  On Tuesday\u2019s broadcast of  Jimmy Kimmel Live!  Chastain revealed  something struck me as odd  when she took a close look at the plaque. But it was  not a big deal  and she  didn\u2019t want to make a scene,  she said. It had been  a good laugh  and provided a  great day of laughter,  Chastain added to host Jimmy Kimmel, who\u2019d likened the portrait to one of a powerlifter \u2015 which she laughingly agreed with.

      "text": "The NFL on Wednesday approved a new policy to intercept national anthem protests before they happen, according to the league. The measure mandates that players who are on the field must stand for the national anthem but can remain in the locker room if they choose. Teams could be fined by the league if their players sit or kneel, as many have done in protest of racial injustice and police brutality in recent seasons after NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick\u2019s initial kneeling protest in 2016 earned nationwide attention. The fining or punishment of players and other personnel would be dictated by the individual teams. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell noted in a statement Wednesday that  on-field protests created a false perception among many that thousands of NFL players were unpatriotic.   This season, all league and team personnel shall stand and show respect for the flag and the Anthem,  he said.  Personnel who choose not to stand for the Anthem may stay in the locker room until after the Anthem has been performed.  The NFL Players Association criticized the league for failing to consult with the union on the matter.  Our union will review the new \u2018policy\u2019 and challenge any aspect of it that is inconsistent with the collective bargaining agreement,  the union said. On Tuesday, Sports Illustrated reported on a different, apparently scrapped, proposal in which teams could be penalized on the field for players kneeling. In that scenario, the home team would decide whether both teams would come out of the locker room for  The Star-Spangled Banner.  And if the teams do emerge and players kneel, officials could assess a 15-yard penalty, the outlet wrote, citing unnamed sources.  As always, conversations at league meetings are candid, thoughtful and thorough,  NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told HuffPost in an email early Wednesday.  The clubs explore every option and idea on any policy, and discuss the merits and drawbacks of each approach. We will continue the conversation this morning.  The league also debated the issue in previous meetings since former 49ers quarterback Kaepernick sparked national controversy in the 2016 season by taking a knee during the anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. The movement, which grew to include other players and teams, continued in 2017, prompting repeated outrage from President Donald Trump. Kaepernick, who was not signed by an NFL team in 2017 after he became a free agent, and former teammate Eric Reid, who also protested, have filed grievances against the league for allegedly conspiring to keep them off NFL rosters because of the demonstrations.

      "text": "A legal defense fund created in the wake of the Me Too movement is confronting two of the largest employers in the United States about sexual harassment in the workplace. The Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, housed by the National Women\u2019s Law Center, on Tuesday announced new efforts to tackle claims of sexual misconduct at McDonald\u2019s and Walmart. Female cooks and cashiers at McDonald\u2019s, with the financial support of the defense fund, have filed 10 charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in recent days against restaurant locations in nine cities, including Detroit, Los Angeles and New Orleans. One McDonald\u2019s worker in Chicago alleges that a manager asked her if she wanted to see his penis, and described  lurid fantasies  about what he would like to do to her. She said she was fired when she reported the harassment, according to a press release about her case. Breauna Morrow, a 15-year-old cashier at a McDonald\u2019s in St. Louis, said her supervisors did nothing when she complained of a co-worker who repeatedly sexually harassed her.  McDonald\u2019s advertises all over television saying it\u2019s \u2018America\u2019s best first job,\u2019 but my experience has been a nightmare,  Breauna said in a statement.  I know I\u2019m not the only one and that\u2019s why I\u2019m speaking out, so others don\u2019t have to face the harassment I\u2019ve gone through.  The lawsuits are among the first to arise following the creation of the defense fund in late 2017, amid a wave of sexual misconduct allegations against powerful men in Hollywood, the media and other industries. The Time\u2019s Up Defense Fund, backed in part by A-listers like Reese Witherspoon and Kerry Washington, offers financial backing for workers to effectively challenge sexual harassment.  Sexual harassment takes a devastating toll on the women who endure it,  Sharyn Tejani, director of the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund, said on a call with reporters Tuesday.  The fast food industry has an atrocious record on sexual harassment in the workplace,  Tejani said.  No worker at any job ever should have to endure abuse for a paycheck.  Fight for $15, the organization focused on establishing a higher minimum wage for fast-food workers, partnered with Time\u2019s Up on the McDonald\u2019s cases. Fight for $15 announced Tuesday that it has set up a hotline for fast-food workers to have their charges reviewed by lawyers.  The McDonald\u2019s workers are demanding the company enforce the zero tolerance policy against sexual harassment outlined in its manual. They are also calling for mandatory sexual harassment trainings for managers and employees. In a statement to HuffPost, Terri Hickey, a spokeswoman for McDonald\u2019s USA, said the company is  committed to a culture that fosters the respectful treatment of everyone.   There is no place for harassment and discrimination of any kind in our workplace,  Hickey said.  McDonald\u2019s Corporation takes allegations of sexual harassment very seriously and are confident our independent franchisees who own and operate approximately 90 percent of our 14,000 U.S. restaurants will do the same.  The Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund also announced Tuesday its role in a lawsuit filed by Gina Pitre, a former Walmart worker in Mississippi. Pitre alleges that her manager made  unwelcomed sexual comments [and] unwelcomed requests for text pictures  during her time at Walmart, the country\u2019s largest corporate employer of women.  For more than a year, my manager at Walmart repeatedly sexually harassed me while I was on the job,  Pitre said in a statement.  I tried to tell the company what was happening, but Walmart did nothing to hold the harasser accountable or keep me safe.  Randy Hargrove, a spokesman for Walmart, told HuffPost the company had investigated Pitre\u2019s accusations and  could not find sufficient evidence to substantiate a violation of our discrimination and harassment policy.   We take this matter seriously and we will respond appropriately,  Hargrove said. Last week, members of OUR Walmart, an advocacy group for retail workers, sent a letter to Walmart CEO Doug McMillon, demanding the company commit to stricter policies on sexual harassment. The letter, signed by several high-profile activists including actress Susan Sarandon, called on Walmart to create a streamlined, transparent process for filing sexual harassment complaints. Hargrove said the company already has  strong policies and procedures in place to address allegations of sexual harassment.   We believe our current practices meet or exceed many of the requests in the letter,  he said.  Like anything at Walmart, we will continue to review our policies and enhance them as appropriate.  Pitre and other OUR Walmart members refuse to back down until they feel meaningful change has taken place.  I\u2019m speaking up for justice for myself and so that no woman has to experience what I went through at Walmart or in any job,  Pitre said in a statement.  Time is up for sexual harassment \u2015 and for companies that won\u2019t take action to protect their employees.  Need help?

      "text": "Starbucks announced a new policy of inclusivity on Saturday that will permit anyone to sit in its cafes or use the stores\u2019 restrooms, regardless of whether they\u2019ve bought anything, The Associated Press reported. The move comes weeks after one of the coffee chain\u2019s stores in Philadelphia incited outrage for calling the police on two black men who had not made a purchase while they waited for a friend to arrive.  We are committed to creating a culture of warmth and belonging where everyone is welcome,  the company said in a statement. Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson were arrested for  trespassing  on April 12 after a Starbucks store manager in Philadelphia called the police. Nelson said he\u2019d asked the manager if he could use the restroom when he arrived in the cafe but was told the facilities were for paying customers only. The men said they\u2019d been waiting for a friend to arrive when the police arrived and they were arrested \u2015 mere minutes after they\u2019d entered the store. Their arrest, captured on camera, quickly became a public relations nightmare for Starbucks. Protests erupted at the Philadelphia store and demonstrators accused the cafe\u2019s staff of racism. The manager no longer works for the company.  The company moved quickly to control the damage. Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson flew to Philadelphia soon after the incident to personally meet with the two men, who later settled with the company for an undisclosed sum and free college tuition for an online program created by Starbucks for its employees. Separately, they got a symbolic $1 each from the city of Philadelphia and a pledge from officials to set up a $200,000 to promote entrepreneurship among high school students. Johnson also announced plans to close more than 8,000 Starbucks stores in the U.S. on May 29 so workers can receive training about racial bias. Starbucks said Saturday that going forward, its employees had been told to  consider anyone who walks into its stores a customer  \u2015 whether or not they buy anything, reported AP. The company noted, however, that law enforcement will be notified if a customer appears to pose a threat to safety. Starbucks founder and chairman Howard Schultz said last week that while the company doesn\u2019t  want to become a public bathroom... we\u2019re going to make the right decision 100 percent of the time and give people the key.   We don\u2019t want anyone at Starbucks to feel as if we are not giving access to you to the bathroom because you are less than. We want you to be more than,  Schultz said during a Thursday discussion at Atlantic Council, a Washington think tank, according to Bloomberg.  "

      "text": " Ladies and gentlemen, please rise for our national anthem.  You\u2019ll hear some version of this announcement at the start of most sporting events, whether they be professional, college or youth-level. The performance of the national anthem is a well-established part of American athletic competitions.  Yet  The Star-Spangled Banner  typically doesn\u2019t make an appearance at many other public gatherings. We don\u2019t sing or listen to it before concerts, Broadway shows, operas or lectures. So why do we do this for sports?  The answer goes back to America\u2019s pastime: baseball. First, of course, the national anthem began as a poem written by Francis Scott Key in September 1814, after he witnessed the British bombardment of Fort McHenry in Maryland during the War of 1812 (which ran until early 1815).  During the 19th century, the poem gained popularity as a song set to the tune of another popular song,  To Anacreon in Heaven.  It was performed at events like parades, military ceremonies, Independence Day festivities and, yes,  occasionally, sporting events. The earliest documented performance of  The Star-Spangled Banner  at a baseball game took place at the Union Baseball and Cricket Grounds in Brooklyn, New York, on May 15, 1862. It was the park\u2019s opening game, and over time, playing the song on the opening day of the baseball season became a more widespread practice. But singing  The Star-Spangled Banner  before every game did not become commonplace until later.  In 1889, Secretary of the Navy Benjamin F. Tracy signed an order directing that  The Star-Spangled Banner  be the official song to accompany any raising of the American flag by the Navy. In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson signed an executive order designating it as the country\u2019s national anthem for patriotic occasions. But that status didn\u2019t become truly official until 1931, when Congress passed a measure that President Herbert Hoover signed into law. Historians typically point to one notable event when tracing the connection between the national anthem and sporting events: Game 1 of the 1918 World Series between the Boston Red Sox and Chicago Cubs. It was the final year of World War I, a time when many professional baseball games featured marching drills, live bands and other patriotic elements. Given the strains of wartime, however, Game 1 was not well-attended, and the mood was reportedly somber.  During the seventh-inning stretch, however, the band lifted spectators\u2019 spirits with a powerful performance of  The Star-Spangled Banner.  The New York Times recounted the moment:  As the crowd of 10,274 spectators \u2014 the smallest that has witnessed the diamond classic in many years \u2014 stood up to take their afternoon yawn, that has been the privilege and custom of baseball fans for many generations, the band broke forth to the strains of  The Star-Spangled Banner.  The performance was so well-received that bands played the song during the subsequent games in the World Series that year. And from then on,  The Star-Spangled Banner  was a regular feature of special baseball occasions like opening day, national holidays and the World Series. During World War II, playing the national anthem before regular baseball games became the norm, thanks to an upswing in patriotic sentiment and technological developments in sound systems that allowed for the playing of the song without the added expense of hiring a band. The practice spread to other sports as well. After the war ended in 1945, NFL Commissioner Elmer Layden stated his intention to make  The Star-Spangled Banner  a permanent part of every football game.   We must not drop it simply because the war is over. We should never forget what it stands for,  Layden declared.  Not everyone in the sports world agreed, however. In 1954, Baltimore Orioles general manager and World War I veteran Arthur Ehlers decided not to play  The Star-Spangled Banner  before each game and opted to save it for special occasions. He said that frequent repetition  tends to cheapen the song and lessen the thrill of response  and complained about fans not behaving respectfully during the anthem.  Under pressure from the public and the Baltimore City Council, Ehlers eventually changed his mind.  The owner of the Chicago Cubs felt similarly and did not include  The Star-Spangled Banner  as a standard element at home games until the 1960s during the Vietnam War. The Chicago White Sox replaced the anthem with  God Bless America  for a time in the \u201960s but then returned to  The Star-Spangled Banner  after fans expressed their preference for it in an official poll.  With its evocations of warfare and patriotism,  The Star-Spangled Banner  has become a seemingly inextricable part of American sports culture \u2015 and even pop culture, thanks to iconic moments like Whitney Houston\u2019s powerful 1991 Super Bowl performance during the Gulf War.   Sports are a kind of bloodless warfare,  Marc Ferris, author of Star-Spangled Banner: The Unlikely Story of America\u2019s National Anthem, told USA Today last year.  A sort of war without death.  Over the years, the anthem has certainly played a part in cultural wars. Most recently, quarterback Colin Kaepernick\u2019s decision to protest racial injustice by kneeling during  The Star-Spangled Banner  has been the subject of heated debate.  In 1968, Olympic athletes Tommie Smith and John Carlos were thrown out of Olympic Stadium in Mexico City after raising their fists in a Black Power salute as they stood on the medal podium during  The Star-Spangled Banner.   Beyond political protests, actual musical performances of the anthem have generated controversy. In 1968, singer-songwriter Jos\u00e9 Feliciano kicked off Game 5 of the World Series with a bluesy version of the song, which drew complaints from fans expecting a more traditional rendition. In 1990, comedian Roseanne Barr sang the anthem before a Major League Baseball game. She ended her  screechy, off-key  performance by grabbing her crotch and spitting on the ground. President George H.W. Bush called Barr\u2019s rendition  disgraceful.  And in February of this year, singer Fergie came under fire for her  sexy  performance of the anthem at the NBA All-Star Game. For a song meant to unite the country,  The Star-Spangled Banner  can also be quite divisive \u2015 which perhaps makes it all the more fitting for sports.

He knew my daughter Jennifer because Trump has this horse show thing down in Florida,  Gates said.  So he went up and talked to Jen and was being super nice.  Then things got weird.  And then about 20 minutes later he flew in in a helicopter to the same place,  Gates added.  So he clearly had been driven away but he wanted to make a grand entrance in a helicopter.  Trump brought up Jennifer to Gates and his wife, Melinda Gates, and apparently made a point of discussing her physical appearance.

For the first time in the Miss America pageant\u2019s history, its leadership teams will be headed by women, all of whom are former pageant winners. The pageant, established in 1921, announced the appointment of two women on Thursday to head its foundation and its day-to-day operations. The announcement follows an email scandal first reported by HuffPost in December that led to the swift resignation of two male leaders. The leaked emails revealed disparaging and misogynistic comments about the pageant\u2019s participants. Regina Hopper, a former Miss Arkansas who previously served as chair of the Miss America Foundation, will now serve as the Miss America Organization\u2019s president and chief executive officer. Marjorie Vincent-Tripp, who won the Miss America title in 1991, will head the foundation\u2019s board of trustees after serving on it in 2016. The pageant\u2019s organization and foundation are separate nonprofits, with the organization overseeing the competition and the foundation processing the recipients\u2019 scholarships, according to the pageant\u2019s website. The appointments follow former Fox News host and Miss America pageant winner Gretchen Carlson becoming the first Miss America to be appointed to lead the organization\u2019s board of trustees in January.  By putting female leadership in place, we hope to send a strong signal,  Hopper told The Associated Press this week.  We want young women to see Miss America as a place where they can come and benefit and be empowered.  Vincent-Tripp, in a statement shared on the pageant\u2019s website, celebrated the appointments as a new chapter.  It is my hope to continue the mission of expanding the reach of the Foundation to provide scholarship opportunities for young women across the board,  she said. Both Hopper and Vincent-Tripp are lawyers and former TV journalists.  The induction of this all-female leadership team signals forthcoming transformational changes to the entire organization and program, ushering in a new era of progressiveness, inclusiveness and empowerment,  the pageant said in a statement.

      "text": "SEATTLE (Reuters) - Seattle\u2019s city council on Monday approved a new tax for the city\u2019s biggest companies, including Amazon.com Inc., to combat a housing crisis attributed in part to a local economic boom that has driven up real estate costs at the expense of the working class. Amazon, the city\u2019s largest employer, said after the vote that it would go ahead with planning for a major downtown office building that it earlier had put on hold over its objections to a much stiffer tax plan originally proposed. As passed on a 9-0 vote after a boisterous public hearing, the measure would apply to most companies grossing at least $20 million a year, levying a tax of roughly 14 cents per employee per hour worked within the city - about $275 annually for each worker. That  head tax  formula is designed to raise $45 million to $49 million a year over the five-year life of the tax - down from an original $75 million annually - to build more affordable housing and support services for the homeless. The tax would end after five years unless renewed by the city. Amazon had led private-sector opposition to the plan, saying earlier this month it was freezing expansion planning for Seattle pending the outcome of Monday\u2019s action. The move by the world\u2019s largest online retailer, owned by billionaire entrepreneur Jeff Bezos, put in question more than 7,000 new jobs. Following the council vote, Amazon\u2019s vice president, Drew Herdener, said the company has resumed construction planning for its so-called Block 18 project in downtown Seattle, following the pause it announced two weeks ago. However, he added,  We remain very apprehensive about the future created by the council\u2019s hostile approach and rhetoric toward larger businesses, which forces us to question our growth here.  Amazon said it is still evaluating whether to sub-lease space in a second future office tower in Seattle, a project called Rainier Square, meaning it may move some planned jobs elsewhere and thus avoid further raising its tax liability. The tax also would hit such Seattle-based stalwarts as coffee retailer Starbucks and department store chain Nordstrom, as well as California-based tech giants like Apple, Google and Facebook that have enough of a presence in Seattle that they would be subject to the new levy. The tax is expected to be borne by about 500 companies, accounting for 3 percent of the city\u2019s private sector. Healthcare companies are exempt, as are non-profits. Sponsors of the tax said Seattle\u2019s biggest-earning businesses should bear some burden for easing a shortage in low-cost housing that they helped create by driving up real estate prices to the point where the working poor and many middle-class families can no longer afford to live in the city. Supporters cite data showing Seattle\u2019s median home prices have soared to $820,000, and more than 41 percent of renters in the city ranked as  rent-burdened,  meaning they pay at least 30 percent of their income on housing. The Seattle metropolitan area also is home to the third-largest concentrations of homeless people, nearly 12,000 counted in a January U.S. government survey, and almost half of them were living on the streets or otherwise unsheltered. Mayor Jenny Durkan, who expressed concern that the original proposal would lead to an economic backlash, said she would sign the new tax ordinance into law. She had offered an amendment to essentially cut the original $75 million tax proposal in half, but her proposal was rejected last Friday. Council members then negotiated over the weekend to craft a compromise that would gain greater support and was certain to win a veto-proof majority. On Monday, about 40 elected officials from across the United States, some representing local governments in the running to host Amazon\u2019s second headquarters, published an open letter to Seattle in support of the head tax and expressing concern that Amazon opposed the measure.  By threatening Seattle over this tax, Amazon is sending a message to all of our cities: we play by our own rules,  the officials wrote. The head tax approved on Monday is not the first. Denver has enacted a similar tax, and Chicago had one but repealed it. Seattle itself had a head tax in effect from 2006 to 2009 but it was repealed to help businesses in the midst of the recession.

      "text": "Uber will no longer force individual victims of sexual harassment or assault into forced arbitration, the ride-hailing company\u2019s chief legal officer Tony West announced in a blog post Tuesday morning.  Riders, drivers or employees who have been sexually assaulted or discriminated against are free to choose the venue they want to pursue their claims against the company, wrote West, who was a top-ranking official in the Justice Department during the Obama administration and has spoken previously about the pervasiveness of sexual harassment and gender discrimination.  It\u2019s important to give sexual assault and harassment survivors control of how they pursue their claims,  West wrote in the post, noting the company\u2019s need to regain the public\u2019s trust.  Whatever they decide, they will be free to tell their story wherever and however they see fit.  The move comes less than three weeks after 14 women, who said they were sexually assaulted by their Uber drivers, penned an open letter to the company\u2019s board urging it to allow them to pursue justice in an open courtroom, rather than in arbitration.  Silencing our stories deprives customers and potential investors from the knowledge that our horrific experiences are part of a widespread problem at Uber,  the women wrote.  This is not doing the \u2018right thing,\u2019  they said, alluding to the company\u2019s new motto:  We do the right thing. Period.  The letter drew widespread media coverage, including over the issue of forced arbitration. The app\u2019s terms of service require any rider with a complaint against the company, even of sexual assault, to commit to arbitration, essentially private courtrooms where a company typically has the edge in any litigation. West, who did a stint at PepsiCo before joining Uber, credits the new motto in his post on Tuesday, explaining that in order to actually do the right thing the company must now act with  transparency, integrity, and accountability.  Victims can now decide whether to pursue their case in open court or through mediation or arbitration, he wrote. And when survivors settle cases with Uber, the company will no longer require them to remain silent about what happened to them as part of the deal, he added.  Uber also said that it would publicly release a safety report that will include data on sexual assaults and other incidents that occur on the Uber platform. The moves are effective immediately, the company said, and apply to all cases currently pending against the company. Those who previously signed non-disclosure agreements will still be bound by those NDAs.  [Uber CEO] Dara [Khosrowshahi] recently said that sexual predators often look for a dark corner,  West wrote.  Our message to the world is that we need to turn the lights on.  One other tech company \u2015 Microsoft \u2015 has gotten rid of forced arbitration in harassment lawsuits. But Uber\u2019s move is sure to affect far more people, as millions use the service each year. On Tuesday afternoon, Uber\u2019s closest competitor, Lyft, followed its lead and made a similar announcement.   Today, 48 hours prior to an impending lawsuit against their company, Uber made the good decision to adjust their policies,  a Lyft spokesperson said in an email to HuffPost.  We agree with the changes.  Lyft said it was ending its forced arbitration policy for sexual assault victims, whether they\u2019re riders, drivers or employees. Like Uber, the company would still force class actions into arbitration. Lyft also said it would no longer require confidentiality in settlement agreements and plans to release data on sexual assaults. The company said it did not have an estimate of how much the change will cost and declined to say how many harassment and discrimination cases it has pending. Uber\u2019s new policy only applies to individual cases. Victims and survivors who wish to band together and bring class action litigation against the company will still be barred from doing so. For its part, Uber contends that the vast majority of the suits filed against it are at the individual level. Other riders with complaints against the company \u2015 outside the realm of harassment and discrimination \u2015 will still be held to the fine print in the app\u2019s terms of service agreement, requiring that disputes be settled via arbitration.  Uber also said it now supports federal legislation that would allow individuals to opt out of arbitration in cases of sexual assault and discrimination. A bipartisan bill like that was introduced earlier this year with the help of Gretchen Carlson, the former Fox News host who was able to sue the company\u2019s chairman and CEO despite an arbitration clause in her contract.   I\u2019m proud to see companies joining our fight to end arbitration to give more women a voice in harassment and assault cases and unveil the secrecy,  Carlson told HuffPost.  I\u2019m hopeful more companies will follow suit.  Earlier this year, Facebook told HuffPost it was considering whether to support that legislation \u2015 and defended its use of arbitration. All 50 state attorneys general have expressed support for the bill, known as the End Arbitration Act for Sexual Harassment. In the meantime, the fate of many of those women\u2019s assault cases is far from clear. Nine of the 14 women who wrote that open letter are currently suing the company and have asked a California court for class-action status for their case. The women will now be free to pursue their assault charges in court, but only on an individual level. They\u2019re also suing Uber for misleading advertising and fraud \u2015 and the company said those claims would still have to be arbitrated.  Our hope is that Uber ending forced arbitration for victims of sexual assault will begin a process to reduce future suffering by women passengers,  Jean Christensen, the lawyer representing the nine victims.  Uber has made a critical step in this direction, but preventing victims from proceeding together, on a class basis, shows that Uber is not fully committed to meaningful change. Victims are more likely to come forward knowing they can proceed as a group.  This is the beginning of a longer process needed to meaningfully improve safety.  Moving to disclose data on rapes and sexual assaults is risky for the company, West acknowledged in an interview with The New York Times. He said he struggled with the decision because he knows it will be  disturbing,  according to the Times. Uber is a large company and it\u2019s fairly easy to lodge a complaint against it. Also, there\u2019s no standard on how to report such incidents, the company noted. Uber still hasn\u2019t made one key demand: Tightening its driver background checks by running fingerprints through FBI and DOJ databases.  Uber has  so much money that they are willing to allow customers to sue them in court for what happens to them, but they are not willing to make the changes which would make the customers safe,  said Christensen. Uber disputes the usefulness of fingerprint checks and has pointed out that it has made a raft of changes to tighten up safety over the past year. Uber also said it will continue to force other disputes into arbitration, including when a passenger is injured due to driver negligence. Uber\u2019s reputation took a serious hit in the last several years after a series of public gaffes, reports of sexual assaults by drivers that were mishandled and a sexual harassment scandal that felled Uber\u2019s co-founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick.  In light of the numerous high-profile sexual harassment and assault cases across industries in recent months, West\u2019s post also references the Me Too movement and Time\u2019s Up, the coalition of women in Hollywood formed to fight sexual harassment. Uber announced that it created its new policy by consulting with women\u2019s groups and advisers including Tina Tchen, Michelle Obama\u2019s former chief-of-staff and one of the founders of the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund. This article has been updated to include additional comments from Lyft, Christensen and Carlson. "

Stewart, who is a member of the film festival\u2019s jury this year, posed for photographers while wearing a pair of Christian Louboutin stilettos. The actress then swiftly removed her shoes and walked the rest of the red carpet barefoot on her way to a screening of Spike Lee\u2019s film  BlacKkKlansman.  Stewart has not said whether she removed her shoes to protest the French festival\u2019s rule requiring women to don high heels, and her representatives did not return HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. But the star has spoken out in the past against what many consider an arcane dress code. At the 2016 festival, Stewart told Vanity Fair that the policy needed to change immediately.   If [a man and I] were walking the red carpet together and someone stopped me and said, \u2018Excuse me, young lady, you\u2019re not wearing heels. You cannot come in,\u2019 then [I\u2019m going to say], \u2018Neither is my friend. Does he have to wear heels?\u2019  she said at the time.  It can work both ways. It\u2019s just like you simply cannot ask me to do something that you are not asking him. I get the black-tie thing but you should be able to do either version \u2014 flats or heels.  That same year, Julia Roberts went barefoot on the Cannes red carpet. The high-profile rebellions against the dress code seem to stem from a 2015 incident when middle-aged women wearing rhinestone flats were turned away from a screening of the film  Carol.  The festival cited the  obligatory heels  policy in response to the outrage. "

Beitar declared in a Facebook post that it was making the move to honor President Donald Trump for recognizing Jerusalem as the capital city and moving the U.S. embassy there. The embassy was scheduled to open Monday, sparking fierce protests. Previous U.S. administrations have kept the embassy in Tel Aviv in an attempt to keep peace efforts percolating, but Trump\u2019s shift has stirred resentment among Palestinians who hope to establish their own future capital in east Jerusalem.  The chairmen of the club, the owner Eli Tabib and the executive manager Eli Ohana have decided to add to the club\u2019s title the name of the American President who made history, and from now on will be called Beitar Trump Jerusalem. We have the greatest love for the president, and we will win,  the team\u2019s statement said, per The Jerusalem Post.  For 70 years, Jerusalem has been awaiting international recognition, until President Donald Trump, in a courageous move, recognized Jerusalem as the eternal capital of Israel. President Trump has shown courage and true love of the Israeli people and their capital, and these days other countries are following his lead in giving Jerusalem its rightful status.  The six-time league champion team has been penalized before because some fans have chanted anti-Arab and Muslim slogans during matches, CNN pointed out. Loyalists lit the team\u2019s offices on fire after it signed two Muslim players in 2013. The name change is not a done deal, according to The Jerusalem Post. Beitar requires approval from the Israel Football Association, and could face legal challenges because  Donald Trump  is a registered trademark in Israel. "

      "text": "Organizers of the prestigious Cannes Film Festival on Monday signed a pledge committing to policies promoting more gender parity, in response to activism from women in the film industry.  The world is no longer the same. We must examine our own practices, our habits and our history,  said festival head Thierry Fremaux, who has faced criticism for the annual event\u2019s inclusion of an abysmally low number of female-directed movies. The adoption of the pledge on Monday came two days after a powerful protest organized by a group of French filmmakers pushing for gender equality, 5050 by 2020. Hollywood\u2019s Times Up movement against workplace sexual harassment also advocated the commitment. The demonstration featured 82 women, led by the Cannes festival\u2019s jury president, actress Cate Blanchett. They marched along the festival\u2019s red carpet on Saturday night, symbolizing the number of movies directed or co-directed by women that have competed in the festival\u2019s main slate throughout its entire history. Since the festival began in 1946, 1,645 movies directed by men have been featured, according to data compiled by 5050 by 2020. Some of the movies were co-directed by multiple men, amounting to 1,688 male directors. The festival\u2019s gender equity pledge has three main components, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Festival organizers will release statistics on the gender breakdown of film submissions, be transparent about members of the festival\u2019s selection and programming committees, and will establish equal gender representation on the festival\u2019s executive board. The pledge also encourages festival organizers to develop goals  to achieve perfect parity.   While modest and incremental, the pledge could encourage larger, long-term changes, as film festivals like Cannes play an important role in championing emerging filmmakers and showcasing movies that go on to receive critical acclaim and awards recognition. Organizers of the pledge hope that other prominent film festivals adopt similar commitments. Leaders of this fall\u2019s Toronto Film Festival, which often marks the unofficial start of the movie awards season, have also promised to sign the pledge. CORRECTION: An earlier version misstated the number of films directed by men. "

A badly beaten Raquel Pennington can be hard telling handlers in her corner  I\u2019m done  and  I want to be done  after the fourth round of her bantamweight bout against Nunes in Rio de Janeiro on Saturday night. But the handlers appear to disregard her plea to throw in the towel.  No, no, no,  a coach can be heard saying. Then Pennington is told,  We\u2019ll recover later.  Pennington answered the bell for the fifth round, absorbing a flurry of punches before the referee stopped the match.  Check out the highlights beginning at 1:20 into the clip.  If she didn\u2019t have the right conditioning to fight, then the coach should have thrown in the towel for sure,  a triumphant Nunes said, per MMA Junkie.  I think my coach wouldn\u2019t let me go through that. It\u2019s sad. Everyone must be saying a lot of bad things about him on social media, but I really think she needs to surround herself with people who want the best for her so she can really evolve for her next fights. Unfortunately, tonight (the cornerman) failed.  The decision sparked online debate, but Pennington\u2019s fiancee, Tecia Torres, defended the move in an Instagram post.  Both us and our coaches agree with the decision made to go into the 5th round,  Torres wrote.  We know Raquel more than anyone else and know if we let her give up on herself going into the last round she would have always regretted it. She fought with heart and grit until the end.  UFC President Dana White did not immediately respond to a HuffPost request for comment. "

The restaurant chain\u2019s parent company, Brinker International, announced last week some outlets were  impacted by a data incident, which may have resulted in unauthorized access or acquisition of your payment card data.  Chili\u2019s, which has more than 1,600 locations worldwide, did not disclose which locations or how many diners might have been affected, but that it believes  the data incident was limited to between March \u2013 April 2018.  The breach involved malware being used  to gather payment card information including credit or debit card numbers as well as cardholder names from our payment-related systems for in-restaurant purchases at certain Chili\u2019s restaurants.  Company officials also said they are  working with third-party forensic experts to conduct an extensive investigation to confirm the nature and scope of this incident.  The officials said law enforcement authorities have been notified and  we are working to provide fraud resolution and credit monitoring services  for those whose information may have been obtained through the breach. The company suggests Chili\u2019s customers monitor their bank and credit card statements for accuracy and contact their banks if there is any suspicious activity. Data breaches have been all too common in today\u2019s cybersphere. A series of notable \u2015 and massive \u2015 data breaches occurred last year. Equifax, Uber, the Dallas emergency siren network and state election systems were just a few of the targets of successful hacks. Compromised data included driver\u2019s license numbers, Social Security numbers and to financial information. "

      "text": "Leaders in the Southern Baptist Convention are seeking to clear the air as a prominent Baptist\u2019s past remarks about women, abuse, and divorce come newly under scrutiny. Paige Patterson, president of Texas\u2019 Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and a major figure in America\u2019s largest Protestant denomination, admitted Thursday that his description of a teenage girl\u2019s body as  nice  in recently resurfaced footage of a 2014 sermon had  obviously been hurtful to women.   I wish to apologize to every woman who has been wounded by anything I have said that was inappropriate or that lacked clarity,  Patterson wrote in a statement on his seminary\u2019s website. In his 2014 talk, Patterson appeared to condone the objectification of a 16-year-old girl\u2019s body. To illustrate how God  beautifully and artistically  created women, he recalled a time when he saw  a very attractive  16-year-old walking by after he\u2019d preached at an event.  She was nice,  Patterson reminisced in the clip, remarking that another man had described her as  built.  On Thursday, Patterson apologized for his words.   Please forgive the failure to be as thoughtful and careful in my extemporaneous expression as I should have been,  the pastor wrote in his statement. Patterson\u2019s apology did not directly address another remark he\u2019s made that has been causing controversy within Southern Baptist circles. He was captured on tape in 2000 advising physically abused wives to avoid divorce whenever possible and to  be submissive in every way.  He\u2019s clarified since that he has counseled women to leave \u2015 albeit not to divorce \u2015 their abusive husbands.  In his apology, Patterson did not address the possibility of divorce as an option for women in abusive relationships. He did, however, explicitly condemn all forms of abuse.  I utterly reject any form of abuse in demeaning or threatening talk, in physical blows, or in forced sexual acts,  he wrote in his statement on Thursday.  There is no excuse for anyone to use intemperate language or to attempt to injure another person.  Patterson\u2019s earlier statements have caused some division within the denomination in recent weeks. Patterson is a prominent figure within the church. As a former president of the entire denomination, he\u2019s credited with leading it toward greater conservatism. Some Southern Baptists are calling for Patterson to resign from his seminary position and withdraw from other duties, such as delivering the sermon at the denomination\u2019s annual meeting in Dallas this June. A petition condemning Patterson\u2019s  damaging, sinful  comments has gathered over 3,000 signatures, mostly from evangelical women. Others are offering their support for Patterson. Female professors and students at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary say he has been a champion for women at their school.  Samuel Schmidt, a pastor from Kentucky and a graduate of Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, has organized a petition to defend Patterson. He claims the leader is being targeted by a  witch-hunt  carried out by  culture warriors, for the sake of political correctness at the expense of the glory of the Gospel.  His letter supporting Patterson has gained over 450 signatures. Amid the tension, Steve Gaines, current president of the Southern Baptist Convention, released a statement on Friday about Patterson. Gaines said he disagreed with the advice Patterson gave abused women (although he also did not address the possibility of divorce). Gaines also said he felt Patterson\u2019s remarks about the teenage girl\u2019s body were  improper.  He asked for forgiveness from women who have been hurt by Patterson\u2019s comments and called on all Southern Baptists to pray for the church. He encouraged them to speak  positively and constructively  about the issue online.  Every word we speak, in private or public conversation, even on social media, should be Christlike and filled with grace,  Gaines wrote in his statement.  Far better to be wronged than to participate in an ungodly exchange of words before a lost world that is listening and watching.  Karen Swallow Prior, a professor of English at the evangelical Christian Liberty University, was one of the Southern Baptist women who signed the petition denouncing Patterson\u2019s past remarks. She told HuffPost that Patterson\u2019s apology appeared to be a step in the right direction. However, she said, repentance is shown  not through words, but through actions.  Prior said she is waiting to see whether Patterson\u2019s seminary will take a stand on the issue. The seminary\u2019s board of trustees is scheduled to meet on May 22 in light of recent events.  This situation is not just about one man. The power of this one man depends upon the support of many men,  Prior wrote in an email.  The leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention are at a crossroads. The way they deal with this situation going forward will proclaim to the church and the world how they think women should be treated.  "

      "text": "Sophia started using Uber soon after it was founded in 2009. She doesn\u2019t even remember agreeing to, much less reading, the fine print in the app\u2019s terms of service. This would only become important in hindsight. Last December, the 26-year-old San Francisco Bay Area native took her final Uber ride. It should\u2019ve been a forgettable 12-minute trip from her company\u2019s holiday party to her home, but it turned into something terrible. When the car pulled up in front of her apartment building, Sophia\u2019s driver asked if he could walk her inside. She said no. Then, just as she was keying in the code to open the front door, he snuck up behind her, pushing her into the foyer. He grabbed her up into a bear hug and groped her. She got away, briefly, fleeing up the stairs to her apartment. He followed. In front of her apartment door, he again squeezed her tightly, putting his hand up her dress. Luckily, she made it inside her apartment and locked him out.  Later, after reporting her assault to the police, Sophia learned that her driver was a registered sex offender. How could Uber have allowed this man to drive for the company? she wondered. Sophia, who does not want to publicly reveal her last name, is one of nine women suing Uber for fraud, misleading advertising about its level of safety, and assault, battery and rape. The women are demanding that the ride-sharing company truly reckon with what they say is a widespread sexual assault issue.  The details of Sophia\u2019s attack are documented in the lawsuit, where she is identified as Jane Doe #3. The case was filed in 2017 and updated in March when Sophia and six other women joined the suit.  While a few of the other women suing have shared their stories publicly, Sophia is only now coming forward to HuffPost to share her experiences. The women want Uber to fix what they see as its  flawed  background check system, the lawsuit says. Because the system is designed to quickly approve drivers, Uber skips steps that would screen out sex offenders like the one who assaulted Sophia, according to the suit. Though Uber has recently announced changes to its system, these women say they\u2019re insufficient. The women say the only way they can force Uber to improve its standards is if they bring their case into a public courtroom \u2015 and this highlights a second, possibly even larger issue with Uber: When users download the app, they unwittingly click away their right to file a lawsuit against the company. Uber\u2019s terms of service, which, let\u2019s admit, most people don\u2019t read, require all customers to settle disputes \u2015 even over sexual assault and rape \u2015 in arbitration. These are private courtrooms, outside the public justice system, that notoriously favor big companies.  Uber has already filed a motion in court arguing that these women have no right to make their case in a public courtroom. That spurred action from the nine women and a few others, who penned an open letter to the company\u2019s board of directors urging Uber to reconsider.   Secret arbitration takes away a woman\u2019s right to a trial by a jury of her peers and provides a dark alley for Uber to hide from the justice system, the media and public scrutiny,  the women wrote. Uber defended its use of arbitration in a statement in March when the case expanded, but has since changed its tune somewhat. During a Twitter exchange with Susan Fowler, a former Uber employee who famously shared her story of workplace sexual harassment and discrimination, Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi said he would look at the issue.  Sexual assault has no place anywhere and we are committed to doing our part to help end this violence,  the company told HuffPost in a statement.  As we prioritize safety at Uber, we are taking a hard look at these important issues.  In arbitration, each woman would have to fight her case alone, on an individual level. The best outcome would be, maybe, a cash settlement. Often, such settlements are kept private through nondisclosure agreements, so other assault victims wouldn\u2019t learn about women who\u2019ve gone through similar experiences. The chances that the company would be forced to re-examine the way it does business are nil. Sophia told HuffPost she\u2019s not doing this for money, but to effect change.  The only thing I can really do is help others,  she said.  I think it\u2019s stronger to join others so we can help others not have this happen to them.  Publicly embarrassed by the letter \u2015 with Khosrowshahi getting called out on Twitter \u2015 the company asked for more time from the court to consider the women\u2019s plea. Uber now has a court-sanctioned deadline of May 17 to formally decide if its sexual assault issues get a public airing out. At a time when women are increasingly unwilling to stay silent about sexual abuse, the idea that a company can keep its problems private through arbitration has become harder to defend.  There are bills at both the federal and state level to stop companies from forcing women into arbitration in sexual harassment and assault cases. Microsoft announced earlier this year that it would no longer force harassment cases filed by its employees into arbitration. Orrick, a major law firm, made a similar announcement in March. Uber has said it has no issue with these women telling their stories in public. But news stories alone can\u2019t always bring justice or closure to victims. There\u2019s a particular power in letting rape survivors bring their stories into a public courtroom \u2015 and to have other women join them and say  me too.  Anyone who watched the victims of Larry Nassar confront their disgraced abuser in a Michigan courtroom in January knows this. We saw the power of a public trial again in the Bill Cosby case.   Having public disclosure in a courtroom about what happened, that\u2019s part of the public record. There\u2019s a real power in that,  said Hannah Brenner, a professor at California Western School of Law who researches the intersection of law and gender, focusing specifically on sexual assault, institutions and disparate power dynamics.  That these women have banded together is particularly powerful.  There\u2019s a tendency for us to dismiss sexual violence as a one-off,  Brenner said. Collectively, these women are a force more difficult to ignore. Citing hundreds of media reports about Uber-related sexual assault, the women suing the company say it has a systemic problem on its hands.  Jeanne Christensen, the lawyer representing the nine women, has been representing rape and assault victims in cases against Uber since at least 2014. She\u2019s negotiated privately with Uber, case by case, but said that last year she grew fed up with the one-off system and became determined to push the company to do more.  The stories are always the same,  she told HuffPost. Christensen\u2019s clients typically said they hailed an Uber ride after a night of drinking, and that their driver then assaulted and, in some cases, raped them. She couldn\u2019t go into more detail, citing confidentiality. Many of her clients are living in fear, she said, afraid their attacker will come after them again.  It\u2019s very common for clients to move apartments. They break leases. That\u2019s how frightened they are,  she said.  They get new phones, change their numbers.  Yet it\u2019s hard to know the real scope of Uber\u2019s sexual assault problems. The company does not release information about reported incidents, police departments don\u2019t track rape data that way \u2015 and sadly, most women do not report sexual assault to anyone at all. The company said it is looking at ways to better track assaults. While rapes and assaults that take place in Uber cars do get a lot of media attention, they are just a small percentage of sexual assaults in the U.S. Strangers aren\u2019t the biggest danger when it comes to rape.  While the Uber assaults are scary, women are still most at risk of being assaulted by someone they know,  said Melissa Morabito, a professor at the School of Criminology and Justice Studies, Center for Women & Work, at the University of Massachusetts Lowell.  Earlier this spring, Uber announced a host of changes meant to strengthen its background check process for drivers, as well as several new safety features. And Khosrowshahi has said publicly that safety is his No. 1 priority. The Uber app will now be better integrated with 911, making it easier for emergency services to find you on the road. The company said it would re-run background checks on all drivers each year to make sure no new incidents have cropped up \u2015 something it did inconsistently in the past. Uber also said it would begin using a technology that would alert them when Uber drivers were arrested in real time. The company  offers features that ensure every trip is GPS tracked, 24/7 response from our safety team, and the ability to share your trip with loved ones in real time, and we\u2019re committed to doing more,  it said in a statement. Uber also announced it was bringing on former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson as chairman of Uber\u2019s safety advisory board. But Christensen says these moves are not enough. Uber\u2019s checking process isn\u2019t much different than the credit check you\u2019d have to go through if you were trying to rent an apartment, she told HuffPost. The check only goes back seven years, according to the women\u2019s lawsuit. (Uber says that its checks can extend beyond that period depending on the database the company is searching.) The company needs to run driver\u2019s fingerprints through the FBI and Department of Justice\u2019s databases, the suit says.  Uber says that the fingerprint system is not a panacea and comes with its own set of flaws. There are concerns, for example, that some people \u2015 who haven\u2019t been convicted or who\u2019ve had their charges dismissed \u2015 get inaccurately labeled as criminals. The company cites data that show hundreds of thousands of Americans can\u2019t get jobs because of flaws and inaccuracies in the system. Uber argues that  While no background check is perfect, our process is robust, fair and relevant to the work at hand.   The predominance of regulators believe that our screening processes are appropriate,  Khosrowshahi told The Washington Post recently.  I don\u2019t think fingerprints would substantially change what happens with human behavior. \u2026 The predators in life look for dark corners. Our job is to tell the world that Uber has its lights on.   Sexual assault is about a predator stealing a part of you that you will never get back. I fight unceasingly against the shame, the loss of feeling safe, and the debilitating anxiety,  Sophia wrote in a statement she shared with HuffPost (read it in full below).  If Uber had done their due diligence, my devastation could have been avoided.  For now, Sophia is trying to find another place to live. She will only stay the night at home if her roommates are around, she said. She fears that the Uber driver who assaulted her might come look for her again.  Sophia fought her attacker off that December night in a struggle that lasted minutes, but that she said felt infinite.  I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever been in a car accident where time is moving extremely slow. You\u2019re trying to make the best decisions you possibly can, but if you\u2019re in the state too long, your brain can\u2019t handle it,  Sophia told HuffPost.  You\u2019re in a constant state of panic. It\u2019s like going in and out of consciousness.  She said she punched the Uber driver in the stomach and ran into her apartment, locking the door and windows. The morning after the attack, she opened her Uber app and reported the incident.  I think I was still in shock. I didn\u2019t think about the right way to do this,  Sophia said. She figured since she had a problem with the service, she should start there.  It seemed like the right move. Very quickly I realized it was not the right move.  A customer service rep called Sophia back and she told the woman what happened.  She said she\u2019d reimburse me for the ride and that they take this seriously and she\u2019d follow up again soon. It was a very short call,  Sophia said, estimating that the conversation probably took less than five minutes. The representative wasn\u2019t particularly empathetic. Sophia compared her demeanor to that of a barista taking your coffee order.  My $17 back was just not what I was going for. It didn\u2019t make me feel safer; that was the main thing,  she said.  I didn\u2019t feel any safer, and it was a pointless call.  Sophia walked to her local police department after that. The cops talked to her for hours, she said. Uber eventually got back to her and told her that her driver was no longer working for the company and that he\u2019d been warned by the police not to come near her.  I don\u2019t know what happened to him,  she said. The company didn\u2019t respond to specific questions about Sophia\u2019s allegations. Sophia doesn\u2019t use the Uber app anymore, but said that living in San Francisco, it\u2019s impossible not to be reminded of the service every day.  Every time I have a noxious reaction,  she said, adding that she now feels like she had blinders on when it came to using the app. She figured Uber was a strong business and had naturally figured this safety thing out, she said.   I got a little bit fooled by that. I didn\u2019t think enough through about what they were doing. I don\u2019t think they did either.   Read Sophia\u2019s full statement below. Sexual Assault is about a predator stealing a part of you that you will never get back. There is no settlement amount or number of criminal convictions that can replace what has forever been lost. To me, this is the most painful aspect of being a sexual assault survivor. I\u2019ve been given a life-sentence of battling the excruciating psychological effects of being violated; I fight unceasingly against the shame, the loss of feeling safe, and the debilitating anxiety. While I am strong and resilient, while I do not want to victimize myself, I want to be transparent and honest about the reality of surviving trauma, as I do not know how else to protect others. This story has been updated to include more information from Uber on how far back its driver background checks extend. Need help?

      "text": "SEATTLE \u2015 The 9:30 a.m. meeting of the Seattle City Council\u2019s Finance and Neighborhoods Committee \u2015 the most boring name imaginable \u2015 was overflowing. People in the crowd held up signs:  Don\u2019t vote our jobs away  or  Tax the rich.  The committee was taking public comment on the proposed Progressive Tax on Business, a fee on Seattle\u2019s largest corporations to support homeless services. Last week, Amazon \u2014 the employer of more than 45,000 Seattleites that is on the hook for an estimated $20 million under the tax \u2014 announced it was pausing construction planning on a tower downtown and would consider renting some of its office space to other companies if the fee goes through. Now the mayor and City Council have to decide whether to take this threat seriously. About a third of the attendees at Wednesday\u2019s hearing were wearing construction vests. One of them told committee members that if the tax passes, workers will have to go home, look their kids in the eye and tell them Daddy doesn\u2019t have a job anymore. Another called a member of the City Council a communist (she\u2019s actually a socialist) and said she  seems to be getting paid by the residents of Seattle to throw temper tantrums.   The applause in the room was deafening.  But the fight is about more than just one company or one policy. It is about the growing challenge of running American cities and all the ways companies make it even harder. Seattle faces an impossible choice: Either raise revenue from employers and risk driving them away, or keep levying taxes on voters and risk a backlash that could exacerbate the very problem it\u2019s trying to solve. Whatever happens here, it will be a template for the rest of the country.  The details of Seattle\u2019s proposed tax are crucial to understanding why Amazon hates it so much. Under the current proposal, the city will charge large companies 26 cents for every hour their employees work. That\u2019s about $520 per worker every year. Though the tax will apply only to companies with more than $20 million in revenue per year, or about 3 percent of Seattle businesses, Amazon employs about 145,000 people. And that structure is only temporary. The tax is flat for the first three years: The same fee is levied on wages whether an employee earns $31,200 a year (the minimum wage here) or more than $100,000 (what many Amazon corporate employees make). But in 2021, the flat fee becomes a payroll tax. Large companies will have to pay 0.7 percent of their employees\u2019 wages \u2014 that\u2019s $220 per year for minimum wage workers and more than $700 for Amazon\u2019s corporate employees. It\u2019s the second part, bigger taxes for bigger incomes, that seems to worry the companies here. A few days after Amazon\u2019s announcement, the CEO of Seattle-based Zillow made the same taking-our-ball-and-going-home threat, calling the tax  misguided and too blunt of an instrument.   But you can\u2019t talk about where the money comes from without talking about where it\u2019s going. Homelessness is an emergency in Seattle. Literally. In 2015, the mayor issued an emergency proclamation over the sheer number of people sleeping outside and in their cars and overflowing from shelters. At last count, Seattle had 11,643 homeless people, and its home of King County had the third-highest homeless concentration in the nation. A study last year by Zillow estimated that every 5 percent rise in Seattle rents pushed 258 more people into homelessness. Rents here rose 13.5 percent last year alone.  The proposed tax would raise about $75 million per year to help address this crisis, bringing the city\u2019s total homelessness budget up to $200 million. Three-quarters of the revenue would go toward building affordable housing and a smaller chunk would go toward direct, immediate services \u2014 things like temporary shelters,  hygiene centers  and shelter beds.   This isn\u2019t about Amazon,  said Lisa Herbold, a Seattle City Council member and a co-sponsor of the tax.  It\u2019s about the humanitarian crisis in our city.  It\u2019s clear that Seattle\u2019s tax is going to piss off Amazon. The question is, how much? Everything the company has said so far has been pretty tepid. Amazon has not, in fact, stopped construction on any downtown towers. It has stopped planning future construction, a much different (and less costly) decision. Similarly, the company announced it was exploring the option of subleasing some floors in one of its already-under-construction office buildings. That doesn\u2019t mean Amazon is crying wolf, but it does mean there\u2019s still a lot of uncertainty about the company\u2019s response. Even if members of the Seattle City Council approve the tax \u2014 hell, even if they triple it \u2014 Washington is still a relatively cheap place to do business. It has no income tax (which is effectively a pay raise for Amazon employees who move here from elsewhere), no capital gains tax and no corporate income tax. The city even passed an almost identical tax on employees, albeit at a much lower rate, in 2006 before repealing it during the recession.  Then there\u2019s the public relations aspect to consider. Though it will grow after 2021, Amazon\u2019s tax bill under the law will be pocket change compared with its $1.6 billion in profits last quarter alone. Moving employees, halting construction and reversing course all have costs, too.  Plus, does a not-super-popular corporate behemoth really want to pull thousands of jobs out of a city over being asked to fund services for the homeless? While Amazon is less reputation-conscious and less likely to be harmed by a boycott than a lot of companies are, its executives must know that throwing a hissy fit over this law would create some backlash. Amazon could still pull jobs out of Seattle anyway. The only thing CEO Jeff Bezos loves more than expanding his company is hating taxes. When a handful of states tried passing laws requiring internet retailers to collect sales tax in 2012, his vice president for global public policy called the efforts  unconstitutional.   A few years ago, Amazon halted plans to build a warehouse in South Carolina when local lawmakers wouldn\u2019t grant an exemption to the state sales tax. Bezos even reportedly considered incorporating his company on a Native American reservation to avoid taxes. Just because leaving Seattle over a small tax increase would be bananas doesn\u2019t mean it won\u2019t happen. In the past five years, Seattle has seen unprecedented growth, much of it driven by Amazon and other large companies. That has put unbearable strain on the housing market, schools and infrastructure. As the bill for services has grown, the way the city pays for them has become increasingly unjust. Washington has the most regressive tax structure in the country. The poorest 20 percent of residents pay an average of 16.8 percent of their income in state taxes. The richest 1 percent pay just 2.4 percent. This means low-income people are effectively paying for the city\u2019s growth. And yet, nearly every route to fixing Seattle\u2019s tax and revenue mess is blocked. The most obvious fix, an income tax, is illegal under the state constitution (or at least the way the state Supreme Court interpreted the constitution in 1951). Last year, the City Council passed a  high earners tax,  but a lawsuit preventing its implementation was filed about 10 minutes later. Alongside the (high and regressive) sales tax, Seattle relies heavily on property taxes. But, thanks to a 2001 ballot initiative, those revenues aren\u2019t allowed to grow by more than 1 percent per year. Everything the city needs (libraries, fire stations, schools) has to be individually approved by voters. Though Seattle\u2019s property taxes are below average compared with other cities, the constant levies and add-ons contribute to a sense among Seattleites that the city is squeezing them for more money every year without keeping up its end of the bargain. Homelessness is the perfect encapsulation of this dynamic. As the city has grown, it\u2019s nearly doubled its budget for homeless services. In 2016, voters approved a $290 million affordable housing levy. The city is getting more people into permanent housing than ever before.  But living here, it is immediately and viscerally clear that these efforts aren\u2019t enough. Rising rents are pushing people onto the streets faster than the city can bring them back inside. Nearly half of the city\u2019s homeless population is now unsheltered. Last year, a record 169 people died sleeping on the street, and the city is already on track to break the record again.  Seattle\u2019s current situation exposes a fundamental challenge for lawmakers across the country: Solving big problems requires bold, transformational policies. What city leaders can pass in the face of structural barriers and skeptical voters, however, are merely small, incremental improvements to the status quo. And that\u2019s exactly what the Progressive Tax on Business is: a half-measure. No matter what Amazon decides to do, taxing employment, just like taxing cigarette purchases, will result in less of it. And the new tax probably won\u2019t result in a significant reduction in the city\u2019s homeless population. The city estimates the tax will produce 1,780 units of affordable housing, even though its own resolution says it needs more than 17,000.  None of that is an argument against the tax. As council member Herbold points out, this may be Seattle\u2019s only available route toward making its tax code more progressive. Despite the fireworks at public hearings, the tax is relatively modest and is specifically tailored to affect only the companies that can afford it. Nor is it the only tax of its kind: Wilmington, Delaware; Denver; and plenty of other cities tax companies on the number of employees they have, a so-called head tax.  This week, as Seattle debated the $75 million head tax, the Chamber of Commerce released a report estimating that solving homelessness would cost $400 million. A proposal by the mayor to reduce the revenue to $40 million triggered an even more raucous committee hearing, with protesters chanting  $75 million, no extortion!  to another packed audience. The original proposal passed and will be voted on Monday, but the mayor could still veto it.  But that is the debate here, what has become possible and necessary to the city to fight over: Whether to spend 10 percent of what it will cost to solve homelessness or 20 percent.  But the bigger question is how cities should respond to threats like Amazon\u2019s.  The request for proposals for the company\u2019s second headquarters stated explicitly that  a stable and business-friendly environment and tax structure will be high-priority considerations.  Cities responded in kind: Chula Vista, California, offered free land. Fresno, California, offered control over how municipal revenues would be spent. Chicago even offered to waive income taxes for Amazon employees.  The calculation these cities are making is all about the multiplier: Every job created by Amazon creates another 1.5 in  indirect employment  \u2014 consultants, chefs, schoolteachers. Except those employers won\u2019t get any of the tax breaks. Perversely, it\u2019s only the largest companies, the ones with the most power and the littlest need for unfair advantages, who get cities falling all over themselves to give away revenues.  It\u2019s not even clear what Seattle gave up to entice Amazon\u2019s most recent expansion here. The company didn\u2019t respond to inquiries about how many employees it has in Seattle or how much it pays in city and state taxes (though late last week,  a person at the company familiar with the data  made a  rare disclosure  to The Seattle Times that Amazon had paid $250 million in local taxes \u2014 without specifying what types of taxes or where they went). No matter where they operate, companies have every incentive to play exactly the game Amazon is playing. To shareholders, every dollar a company pays in tax is waste. The minute Amazon announces its second headquarters location, it can start pitting its host cities against each other: Hey Seattle, we\u2019re thinking of adding another 1,000 jobs. It\u2019s you or Pittsburgh. What are you going to give us? This is, in fact, almost exactly what the CEO of Zillow warned this week.  We are actively trying to decide where to put the next couple hundred heads, and this is the type of thing that causes us to consider looking at putting that expansion in other cities,  he said. The challenge of finding enough revenue to adequately run a city is only going to get worse. Excluding health care, federal grants to cities are at their lowest since 1980. Despite the growing economy, 30 states have revenue shortfalls. The Trump administration has declared its intention to cut transportation funding and housing assistance. Without outside support, cities will become increasingly reliant on revenues from their own voters and their largest employers.  Seattle is a case study for what those fights are going to look like. The more desperate cities become, the more leverage corporations will wield over them. And, simultaneously, the more frustrated their populations will get at the constant tax raises and fee hikes.  The most depressingly insightful comment from Wednesday\u2019s City Council hearing came from Howard Bess, a counselor for the Downtown Emergency Service Center, a homeless shelter in Seattle. He apologized for being tired; he had been up all night helping Seattle\u2019s homeless population find an  island of relief.   I don\u2019t see that anybody who is opposing this is going to die on the streets,  he said,  or not be able to pay their mortgage or not be able to wear new shoes or clean clothes. But our clients could certainly use that help.   The applause for him was even louder.  "

Members of the group included actresses, directors and other women in the film industry, including Kristen Stewart, Salma Hayek and  Wonder Woman  director Patty Jenkins, The Associated Press reports. Blanchett, the jury president of this year\u2019s festival, led the group and read out a statement from the steps of the Palais des Festivals, joined by French film director Agnes Varda, who read the statement in French. In her remarks, Blanchett explained the significance of the number 82.  On these steps today stand 82 women representing the number of female directors who have climbed these stairs since the first edition of the Cannes Film Festival in 1946,  she said, according to The Hollywood Reporter.  In the same period 1688 male directors have climbed these very same stairs. In the 71 years of this world-renowned festival there have been 12 female heads of its juries.  She added that 71 male directors have received the Palme d\u2019Or, the most prestigious award of the festival. Only one female director, Jane Campion in 1993, has received the Palme d\u2019Or, though Varda won an honorary Palme d\u2019Or in 2015.  Women are not a minority in the world, yet the current state of the industry says otherwise,  Blanchett said.  We stand together on these steps today as a symbol of our determination to change and progress.  The march was planned by 5050 by 2020, a French movement dedicated to gender equality in film. The statement coincides with the Cannes Film Festival\u2019s announcement that it will be signing  concrete, strong commitments  to diversity on Monday, Deadline reports, though it\u2019s not clear what exactly those commitments will be.

      "text": "Cornell University student Letitia Chai stripped down to her underwear while delivering a presentation this week after a professor reportedly told her that her shorts were  too short  just days earlier. About two dozen of Chai\u2019s fellow students joined in.  This topic transcends all of our social identities and taps right into the heart of who we are,  Chai, a fourth-year student, said to a room of nearly 50 people while presenting her thesis paper on May 5, as seen in a livestream of the event. Chai began undressing as she held back tears, first removing her shoes, then her pants and, lastly, her shirt.  I am more than Asian. I am more than a woman. I am more than Letitia Chai. I am a human being,  she said while undressing.  And I ask you to take this leap of faith, to take this next step, or rather this next strip, in our movement and to join me in revealing to each other and to seeing each other for who we truly are \u2014 members of the human race.   Then 28 of the 44 people in the room also took off their clothes, The Cornell Sun reported. Although Chai\u2019s protest happened last week, her story didn\u2019t hit national news until Thursday.   The protest came just days after Chai was presenting a trial run of her thesis in her class  Acting in Public: Performance in Everyday Life  on May 2. When Chai went to give her trial run presentation, professor Rebekah Maggor questioned the student\u2019s outfit choice.    Is that really what you would wear?  Maggor asked Chai, according to a Facebook post the student wrote later that day. Chai, who was wearing a long-sleeve button-down shirt and jean cutoff shorts, said she was  shook  by Maggor\u2019s alleged comments.   The professor proceeded to tell me, in front of my whole class, that I was inviting the male gaze away from the content of my presentation and onto my body,  she wrote on Facebook, noting that her professor is a white woman.  She said I was making a statement by wearing my outfit. I told her that I sure as hell wouldn\u2019t change my statement to make her or anyone else feel more comfortable.  According to Chai, a male international student then made a comment that a presenter has a  moral obligation  to the audience to dress conservatively, at which point Chai fled the room in tears.   I am not responsible for anyone\u2019s attention because we are capable of thinking for ourselves and we have agency,  Chai told The Cornell Sun, referring to Maggor\u2019s alleged comments that her outfit would invite the wrong type of attention.  Maggor responded to Chai\u2019s protest in an email to the Sun.   I do not tell my students what to wear, nor do I define for them what constitutes appropriate dress,  she said.  I ask them to reflect for themselves and make their own decisions.  After Chai gathered herself, she came back into the classroom, stripped down to her underwear and gave her full thesis presentation. In a Facebook post, Chai said she would do the same for her actual thesis presentation and encouraged others to attend and do the same. According to a statement written by 11 of the other 13 students in Maggor\u2019s class that day, the situation may have gone down a bit differently than Chai wrote on Facebook. They wrote that while Maggor made  an error in phrasing,  she had  apologized on more than one occasion.  The students added that Chai\u2019s post did not  adequately represent [Maggor\u2019s] past and continued advocacy for women and minorities.    Our intention in writing this letter is in no way to invalidate any of Letitia\u2019s experience,  the statement reads.  We strongly support and identify with Letitia\u2019s fight for equality ... The majority of us are students of color, from multi-ethnic backgrounds, who very much relate to Letitia\u2019s frustration with systemic oppression that is part of the fabric of this country. We do not want to discredit her narrative. However, we feel it is important and our obligation to share our impression of Wednesday\u2019s events to provide a fair representation of the situation.  Below is an excerpt from the students\u2019 statement detailing how the conversation in question happened (scroll below to read the letter in full): Letitia stood up to give her speech. Before she began, our professor asked Letitia if she would wear  those shorts  to her actual presentation on Saturday. Our professor regularly asks all of the students, male and female, such questions to clarify appropriate attire for public speaking. Our professor went on to say that what you wear and how you present yourself make a statement. She noted that if you were to wear jean shorts to your thesis presentation, that is a statement. Her focus on attire was a means of noting the importance of professionalism in certain public speaking situations. Maggor was unable to provide additional comment at press time, and Chai has not responded to a request for comment. In her original Facebook post, Chai wrote why she chose to protest Maggor\u2019s comments and the larger issue of policing people\u2019s bodies.   This is for every Asian woman who was told to speak up lest others think she\u2019s submissive,  she wrote.  This is for every POC man who was told to pull his pants to be taken seriously, and every POC woman who was asked to straighten her hair to seem intelligent. This is for every gay friend who was told to dress more \u2018straight\u2019 so that others didn\u2019t feel weird around him/her/them. This is for us.  Read the full statement from 11 of the other 13 students in Chai\u2019s class below.  Head over to The Cornell Sun to read more about this story.  "

You are trash and we do not need you,  the comedian said on Wednesday\u2019s episode of  Full Frontal.   Now, Schneiderman was a guest on my show, so this is a little complicated for me to talk about,  said Bee, in reference to her calling him  a hero  for standing up to  democracy\u2019s nemesis  in a November broadcast.

Andrew Cuomo assigned a special prosecutor to investigate allegations that former state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman physically abused multiple women, according to a statement released Tuesday. A New Yorker article published on Monday detailed the stories of four women who accused Schneiderman of abusing them, including slapping and choking them. Cuomo appointed Nassau District Attorney Madeline Singas as the special prosecutor tasked with investigating the allegations and whether any resources or staff members from the attorney general\u2019s office facilitated the reported abuse.  A statement from the governor\u2019s office emphasized that the integrity of the justice system is of  paramount importance.  Cuomo also referenced the need for Singas\u2019 inquiry as the attorney general\u2019s office has an open investigation into the sexual abuse allegations against former Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein.  There can be no suggestion of any possibility of the reality or appearance of any conflict or anything less than a full, complete and unbiased investigation,  the statement given to the Times said.  The victims deserve nothing less.   Schneiderman\u2019s accusers say he assaulted them without their consent during sexual encounters. Two of the women, Michelle Manning Barish and Tanya Selvaratnam, told The New Yorker that Schneiderman, 63,  repeatedly hit them, often after drinking, frequently in bed and never with their consent,  forcing them to seek medical attention. The former attorney general denied the accusations to The New Yorker but resigned shortly after the article went public on Monday.   It has been my great honor and privilege to serve as Attorney General for the people of the State of New York,  Schneiderman said in a statement late Monday.  In the last several hours, serious allegations, which I strongly contest, have been made against me. While these allegations are unrelated to my professional conduct or the operations of the office, they will effectively prevent me from leading the office\u2019s work at this critical time.  "

The director, who pleaded guilty to raping a 13-year-old girl in 1977, told Newsweek Polska that the movement highlighting sexual violence in workplaces around the world is  collective hysteria,  The Associated Press reported Wednesday. Polanski argued that people are embracing the Me Too movement  chiefly out of fear.  According to the AP, he  compared it to North Korea\u2019s public mourning for its leaders that is so intensive that \u2018you can\u2019t stop laughing.\u2019  Polanski gave the interview a few days before the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which administers the Oscars, expelled him and comedian Bill Cosby, after the latter was convicted in April for sexual assault. The interview was published this week. The 84-year-old has resided in France since he fled the U.S. after pleading guilty to raping then-13-year-old Samantha Geimer. Polanski has also been accused of sexual assault by several other women. Some of those incidents allegedly occurred when the accusers were minors. Polanski won an Oscar for best director for his 2002 film  The Pianist.

Margaret Reid played a  Pick 5  bet on Derby day, successfully choosing the winners of races 8 through 12 at Churchill Downs. She made the wager more than 1,000 miles away at the Retama Park racetrack near San Antonio in Selma, Texas.  It was an amazing feeling, yes, that you won a really big ticket \u2014 like, a mini-lotto if you will,  Reid, of Austin, told local CBS affiliate KENS-5 TV.  It was a big ticket because there\u2019s a couple of long shots in the middle of it.  Justify (at 3-1 odds) was Reid\u2019s last pick for the 12th race.

      "text": "The governing body of the United States\u2019 Olympic teams ignored dozens of athletes\u2019 sexual misconduct complaints against two taekwondo champions for years, according to a new lawsuit. The U.S. Olympic Committee, as well as USA Taekwondo, turned a blind eye to decades of alleged sexual abuse by brothers Steven and Jean Lopez, two of the sport\u2019s most high-profile figures, contends a lawsuit filed Friday by four named women, as well as 44 women who have yet to be identified. The lawsuit marks the latest legal battle for the Olympic Committee, which was sued in February over its handling of misconduct claims against Larry Nassar, the disgraced USA Gymnastics doctor who pleaded guilty in November to serial sexual abuse of his patients. Over 265 women have accused Nassar of sexual assault, including Olympic gymnasts Aly Raisman and Simone Biles. The lawsuit accuses USOC, USA Taekwondo and the Lopez brothers of knowingly participating in human trafficking. The organizations were aware of the numerous sexual abuse complaints since 1996 but continued to allow the brothers to travel and interact with young female athletes, the plaintiffs contend.  The USOC is deeply focused on supporting, protecting and empowering the athletes we serve,  Patrick Sandusky, chief external affairs officer for the Olympic Committee, told HuffPost in a statement Tuesday.  We are aggressively exploring and implementing new ways to enhance athlete safety, and prevent and respond to abuse,  Sandusky continued.  The launch of the U.S. Center for SafeSport, along with a number of additional significant actions we are taking, will ensure that our athletes are better protected from these heinous acts.  USA Taekwondo coach Jean Lopez, 44, was banned from the sport last month following accusations that he sexually assaulted four female taekwondo athletes dating back to 1997. A report from the U.S. Center for SafeSport concluded Lopez had engaged in a  decades-long pattern of sexual misconduct  and allegedly used his authority as a coach to  groom, manipulate, and ultimately, sexually abuse younger female athletes.  Jean\u2019s younger brother, 39-year-old Steven Lopez, was temporarily suspended from the sport on Monday pending an investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations. Steven Lopez, a two-time Olympic champion, is one of USA Taekwondo\u2019s most decorated athletes. USA Taekwondo declined to comment on the lawsuit, but confirmed Steven Lopez\u2019s suspension.  While we cannot comment on a case in process, USA Taekwondo fully supports the important work of the U.S. Center for SafeSport and respects its exclusive jurisdiction over sexual misconduct matters,  a representative for USA Taekwondo told HuffPost in a statement.  We will resolutely enforce this immediate suspension and any other sanction imposed by the Center,  according to the statement.  We note that this is an important part of providing a safe and nurturing environment for our athletes. Today\u2019s decision is another example of the progress that is clearly being made in this area.  Neither Lopez brother responded to HuffPost\u2019s requests for comment. "

      "text": "Bank of America has been accused of breaking a promise to stop lending money to companies that sell military-style firearms to civilians after news that the bank agreed to provide critical financing to bankrupt gunmaker Remington. The North Carolina-based bank is among seven financial institutions that have committed to provide Remington, which filed for bankruptcy in March, with an almost $200 million lending package, reported Reuters on Sunday. Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Regions Bank each are forking out $43.2 million in loans to help put debt-plagued Remington on  stable footing,  Reuters said. The gunmaker\u2019s bankruptcy exit plan was recently approved by a Delaware judge.  Terms of the loan agreement were drawn up in late March \u2014 a few weeks before Bank of America pledged to stop underwriting or financing businesses that manufacture military-style weapons for civilian use. The bank said it made the promise after  intense conversations  with its gun-manufacturer clients \u2015 a dialogue prompted by the February massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida.  We want to contribute in any way we can to reduce these mass shootings,  Anne Finucane, the bank\u2019s vice chairman, told Bloomberg TV on April 11. Remington makes Bushmaster assault-style rifles. In 2012, one of them was used by a gunman to kill 20 children and six teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut. Families of the victims sued Remington to hold the gunmaker accountable for the damage caused by the weapon. The bank chose to abide by its loan commitment to Remington because it predated the April pledge, which was meant to kick in on a  go forward  basis, a person familiar with Bank of America\u2019s thinking told HuffPost on Tuesday.  Remington\u2019s financing plan was submitted to the bankruptcy court in March, said the person, who requested anonymity because of the bank\u2019s policy of not discussing client details.  But it had been in the works for weeks, if not months.  Bank of America could legally back out of its agreement to Remington if it wanted to, according to New York Business Journal; it would just have to find other lenders to cover its commitment. The person familiar with Bank of America\u2019s decision pointed out that other financial institutions were reluctant to provide loans to the struggling gunmaker. Reuters reported that 30 potential lenders had refused requests to help Remington in the weeks leading up to the company\u2019s bankruptcy. Finance experts also questioned why Bank of America did not use the loan package as leverage to push Remington to stop manufacturing military-style guns.  Fred Guttenberg, the father of a 14-year-old girl who died in the Parkland, Florida, school shooting, skewered the bank on Twitter Monday for lying to the public, and encouraged people to  stop doing business with them.  Since the Parkland shooting, several financial institutions have moved to distance themselves from the gun industry.  Citigroup, for instance, said in March it would prohibit new retail clients from selling guns to customers who are under 21, and would prevent them from selling so-called bump stocks and high-capacity magazines.  BlackRock, the world\u2019s largest asset manager, recently announced that it had created new investment products for clients who are keen to specifically avoid investing in companies that make or sell firearms. This story has been updated to include comments from a person familiar with Bank of America\u2019s thinking. "

      "text": "Evangelical women from the largest Protestant denomination in the U.S. are publicly voicing their dismay over an influential leader\u2019s  inappropriate  statements about domestic violence and women\u2019s bodies. Hundreds of women who attend churches affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention have signed a petition calling for  decisive action  in response to  damaging, sinful  comments made by Dr. Paige Patterson, president of the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas, and a prominent SBC leader. The open letter, addressed to the seminary\u2019s board of trustees, asks them to take a strong stand against  unbiblical teaching regarding womanhood, sexuality, and domestic violence.   The world is watching us all, brothers. They wonder how we could possibly be part of a denomination that counts Dr. Patterson as a leader,  the letter reads.  The Southern Baptist Convention cannot allow the biblical view of leadership to be misused in such a way that a leader with an unbiblical view of authority, womanhood, and sexuality be allowed to continue in leadership.  Patterson has recently come under scrutiny after a 2000 audio clip resurfaced online in which he advised physically abused wives to stay in abusive relationships,  be submissive in every way  and try as hard as possible not to get divorced. He clarified early last week that at times, he has counseled abused women to leave \u2015 albeit not divorce \u2015 their husbands and report what was happening to the police. However, he said he still thinks that in cases of  non-injurious  abuse, women might choose to  pray through  the situation rather than leave their husbands.  HuffPost\u2019s requests for comment from Patterson and the seminary were not returned. But on Friday, Patterson told The Washington Post that he couldn\u2019t  apologize for what I didn\u2019t do wrong.  Some evangelicals\u2019 overly broad reading of wives\u2019 duty to submit to their husbands, coupled with the belief that divorce should be avoided at all costs, produces a  potent and literally deadly  combination that leads many women to keep enduring abuse, Katelyn Beaty, an editor-at-large at Christianity Today, told HuffPost last week.  It leads pastors like Paige Patterson to justify or excuse domestic violence or to see it as the price of a godly marriage,  Beaty wrote in an email.  This is a gross departure from the biblical text as well as a grave departure from the pastor\u2019s call to shepherd his members.  In addition to the 2000 audio clip, the petition signers also referred to a video clip of a 2014 sermon, in which Patterson appeared to condone the objectification of a young woman\u2019s body. In the sermon, he talked about how God  beautifully and artistically  created women. To illustrate that point, he recalled a time when he spotted a 16-year-old girl after preaching at an event.   She was nice,  Patterson said about the teenager, whom he also described as  a very attractive young co-ed.  He heard a young man near him comment,  Man, is she built.   In his 2014 sermon, Patterson said he defended the young man by saying,  He\u2019s just being biblical. That\u2019s exactly what the Bible says.  The women wrote in the petition that they were  shocked  by Patterson\u2019s objectification of that teenage girl and the  inappropriate nature of his own observations of her body.   Patterson appears in a promotional video for the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary below. The online petition against Patterson was written to gather the signatures of Southern Baptist women, but Southern Baptist men and people from outside the denomination have also signed on \u2015 including Rachael Denhollander, an evangelical Christian and the first woman to publicly accuse former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar of sexual abuse. As of Monday afternoon, over 2,000 individuals had signed the petition. Karen Swallow Prior, a professor of English at the evangelical Christian Liberty University, told HuffPost that she signed the petition to call out a  blind spot.   There is a tremendous blind spot within the old guard of the Southern Baptist Convention, and that blind spot concerns the dignity and place of members who are not white men,  Prior told HuffPost in an email.  I don\u2019t point this out in anger or bitterness, but in love, just as I would want my own blind spots pointed out to me.  The petition had some early difficulties with false signatures, but Prior said the women behind the effort have since taken steps to remove clearly fake or duplicate names. Patterson is a former president of the Southern Baptist Convention, serving for two terms from 1998 to 2000. He\u2019s credited with helping steer the SBC toward greater conservatism. He was elected to deliver the convention sermon at the SBC\u2019s annual meeting in Dallas this June, which is considered an honor for a Southern Baptist pastor.  The scandal over Patterson has divided Southern Baptists, with some calling for him to resign as president of the seminary or voluntarily withdraw as a speaker at the Dallas conference. Delegates to the meeting could also vote to rescind his preaching invitation when the conference begins in June. Other Southern Baptists have continued to offer their support. A petition defending Patterson had gathered over 100 signatures on Monday afternoon.  Roger  Sing  Oldham, a spokesman for the Southern Baptist Convention\u2019s executive committee, told HuffPost that the SBC\u2019s current statement of faith \u2015 which was revised under Patterson\u2019s leadership in 2000 \u2015 calls on Southern Baptists to  provide for the abused in society  and for  husband and wife to live up to the highest ideals of Christian conduct.    Oldham said the SBC also affirms the right of Southern Baptists to express their opinions about convention leaders. However, he said the executive committee does not have authority over or choose to comment on the business of the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary\u2019s board of trustees. On Sunday, the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary announced that Patterson had asked the board of trustees to convene on May 22  in light of recent events.  Prior said she hopes Patterson and other SBC leaders are ultimately able to recognize and repent of the ways they\u2019ve fallen short.   What I want more than anything is true recognition of sin and error \u2014 in this case a pattern of demeaning the female bearers of God\u2019s image in various ways, as well as abuse of power \u2014 and with that recognition, true repentance, not only from one individual but from all who have contributed to a culture that breeds these particular sins,  Prior said.

      "text": "Even Gloria Steinem is blown away by the recent wave of energy and activism that\u2019s exploded since President Donald Trump took office.   I\u2019ve never seen this much activism in my life,  the iconic feminist and social justice activist told clothing company Everlane, referring to gun control activism, the Women\u2019s March and the increasing number of women running for office.  It\u2019s way, way more than anything I\u2019ve ever seen,  she noted.  Steinem, 84, is the first activist to sit down with Everlane for the company\u2019s new video series titled  Human Heroes.  The series debuted Monday morning and highlights people who  have dedicated their lives to empowering their communities and making a difference,  according to Glamour.  The historic activist, who got her start as a writer for New York Magazine in 1968, told Everlane that writing was an integral introduction to organizing.    I always wanted to be a writer but thanks to the women\u2019s movement especially my life came together because I realized that as a writer I could make visible that which had been invisible,  she said. Steinem added that the most recent wave of young feminists gives her energy and, in turn, she brings them hope.   It\u2019s a great trade. We\u2019re better together, right?  she said.   Alex Spunt, head of creative at Everlane, told Glamour that the series is promoting  radical transparency,  which is part of the clothing company\u2019s mission statement.  Defending human rights has been core to our mission of Radical Transparency from the very beginning,  Spunt said.  The Human Heroes series is our way of highlighting individuals who fight for those rights every single day \u2015 and Gloria Steinem is the ultimate Human Hero. For over 50 years she\u2019s fought on behalf of disempowered and disenfranchised women all over the globe and even now, at 84 years old, she still uses her voice to educate and inspire every day.

      "text": "Michelle Obama spoke bluntly to those hoping she will run for political office, telling an audience in Los Angeles that Americans need to focus more on advocating for themselves than looking for someone else to take on that responsibility. The former first lady talked with actress Tracee Ellis Ross at the United State Of Women Summit on Saturday, covering a range of topics. Obama didn\u2019t mince words when the discussion turned to politics and a voice from the crowd interrupted to ask why she wouldn\u2019t seek an elected post.  Stop that,  said Obama, who since her husband\u2019s presidential term ended early last year has frequently said she has no plans to run for anything herself. She told her audience that society has yet to understand her husband\u2019s famed campaign slogan,  Yes, We Can.  Obama spoke about the need for women to come together as a community before looking to one individual woman to solve their problems, and said in that sense she is no different than Hillary Clinton.  When I hear people say, \u2018You run,\u2019 it\u2019s part of the problem,  she said.  We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do before we\u2019re focused on \u2018the who.\u2019 Because we\u2019re \u2018the who.\u2019   We are the answer,  she continued.  All of us here in the room are the answer to our own problems \u2015 it is not finding the one right person that we think can save us from ourselves. It\u2019s us. It\u2019s us.  Obama said that the small ways individuals find to support women\u2019s voices within their own circle will have more of an impact than she could have.  That\u2019s where it starts. Looking for the next person to run, and I don\u2019t mean to cut that off, but that\u2019s been our distraction,  she said. Mentioning that many of her husband\u2019s supporters thought he was going to be the person to  save us,  she noted that  he didn\u2019t end racism.  She made a veiled reference to President Donald Trump and his defeat of Clinton in 2016, saying,  In light of the last election, I\u2019m concerned about us as women. What is going on in our heads that we let that happen? What are girls dreaming about when the most qualified person running was a woman and look what we did? Obama also told Ross that women still need to find ways to empower the girls in their lives to have a voice.  There are still those who aren\u2019t speaking up at their own dinner tables,  she said.  They\u2019re not going to contradict their husbands or their fathers. And we have to figure out, are we doing that? Are we part of that?   Watch the entire interview between Obama and Ross in the clip above.  "

      "text": "    Beth Moore is a prominent American evangelist and author who has spent decades studying and preaching from the Bible.   But as a female leader who has worked within conservative evangelical circles for most of her life, she\u2019s faced misogyny from men in ministry \u2015 whether it\u2019s being ignored or made fun of during team meetings, or being criticized by men who flat-out refused to value Bible lessons taught by a woman.   It\u2019s a reality that the evangelist has largely kept silent about \u2015 until now. On Thursday, Moore posted a blog to her website that revealed some of the sexist attitudes she\u2019s had to endure in more than 20 years of ministry.  Moore says a respected male theologian looked her up and down during their first meeting, smiled  approvingly  and commented that she was  better looking  than another female Bible teacher he knew. She said she learned early to show  constant pronounced deference  to male leaders and when called upon to lead alongside them to  do so apologetically.  Moore said she\u2019s been talked down to by male seminary students who were years younger than her. I\u2019ve ridden elevators in hotels packed with fellow leaders who were serving at the same event and not been spoken to and, even more awkwardly, in the same vehicles where I was never acknowledged. I\u2019ve been in team meetings where I was either ignored or made fun of, the latter of which I was expected to understand was all in good fun. I am a laugher. I can take jokes and make jokes. I know good fun when I\u2019m having it and I also know when I\u2019m being dismissed and ridiculed. I was the elephant in the room with a skirt on. ... Moore is the leader of Living Proof Ministries, an organization she founded in 1994 with the intent of teaching women of all Christian denominations about the Bible. The Texas resident is the author of numerous books and Bible studies, and she\u2019s often called upon to preach at conferences around the world.  Moore was raised a Southern Baptist, part of the largest Protestant denomination in the United States. While Southern Baptists affirm that women have important roles to play in Christian ministry and accept women as students at their theological seminaries, the denomination does not generally believe the Bible allows women to teach or have spiritual authority over men. (Other evangelical denominations have come to a different conclusion about women\u2019s roles in ministry \u2015 Assemblies of God churches, for example, permit the ordination of women.) Moore wrote that many of the men she\u2019s worked with have shown her nothing but respect and support throughout her career. But she said a  colossal disregard and disrespect of women  persists in some male leaders in conservative Christian circles. For years, she chose to silently accept the challenges that come with being a female evangelical leader in the spotlight.  But she wrote on Thursday that she had decided to speak up now about these experiences for the sake of other female leaders in the evangelical world.   I cry foul and not for my own sake. Most of my life is behind me,  she wrote.  I do so for the sake of my gender, for the sake of our sisters in Christ and for the sake of other female leaders who will be faced with similar challenges.  The evangelist\u2019s blog seemed to strike a chord with many Christian women online, who started chiming in with their own stories about what it\u2019s like to be a woman in conservative Christian circles who feels called to lead and to preach. Kaitlyn Schiess, a student working toward a master\u2019s at Dallas Theological Seminary, told HuffPost about a time she experienced pushback from a male classmate.   In one of my classes at seminary, a man asked in the middle of class, \u2018How can I kindly tell my sisters in Christ that they shouldn\u2019t be in the ThM (master of theology) program?\u2019  Schiess recalled.  I appreciate his desire to be loving, but a brief discussion in class about gender roles in the Bible had prompted him to assume the role of ultimate interpreter and judge over the decisions of his female classmates.  The most important thing evangelicals can do to fight this sort of misogyny is value the insight and contributions of women, Schiess said. That means, among other things, ensuring that male pastors are  learning from and with women.   When our seminaries make it possible for men to spend three to five years studying Scripture without women showing up in their classes, on their syllabi or teaching their classes, they will be unprepared to faithfully minister to a church that is at least half women,  she said.  Other women told their own stories on Twitter about being female leaders in the ministry: Moore\u2019s blog post also provoked an outpouring of comments from evangelical men \u2015 including the prominent pastor Thabiti Anyabwile, who wrote a long letter asking for forgiveness for the attitude he had held toward women in the ministry.  I hope, with God\u2019s help, to grow in sanctification, especially with regards to any sexism, misogyny, chauvinism, and the like that has used biblical teaching as a cover for its growth,  Anyabwile wrote. Katelyn Beaty, an editor-at-large at Christianity Today, told HuffPost that verses in the Bible instructing women to submit to men have been misinterpreted by some to essentially  baptize male dominance.  An overly broad approach to women\u2019s submission, coupled with the belief that divorce should be avoided at all costs, is a  potent and literally deadly  combination that leads many women to endure abuse, she said.  It leads pastors like Paige Patterson to justify or excuse domestic violence or to see it as the price of a godly marriage,  Beaty wrote in an email.  This is a gross departure from the biblical text as well as a grave departure from the pastor\u2019s call to shepherd his members.  Moore\u2019s blog comes as controversy about the Southern Baptist Convention leader\u2019s attitudes toward women has roiled the denomination. In a recently resurfaced 2000 audio clip, Patterson, the president of a Southern Baptist seminary in Texas, can be heard claiming that physically abused women should try as hard as possible to avoid divorce. This week, he clarified that, although he doesn\u2019t condone abusive relationships, he thinks  non-injurious  abuse might spur a woman to  pray through  the situation rather than get a divorce. The scandal over Patterson has divided the denomination, with some calling for the leader\u2019s resignation and others standing by him. What Christians, particularly evangelicals, need to do is develop a theology that calls out sexism and misogyny as sins, Beaty said.  This theology will have to be developed by those who hold the most power among evangelicals \u2015 overwhelmingly conservative, white men,  she said.  Otherwise, sexism will continue to be treated as a \u2018women\u2019s issue\u2019 or a liberal/unchristian concern, and little will change.  "

      "text": "Free Drop Billy. Lone Sailor. Good Magic. Instilled Regard. If you guessed those were the names of some of the horses competing in this year\u2019s Kentucky Derby, you\u2019d be right. If you also thought that those words seem like they belong in a game of Mad Libs, you wouldn\u2019t be wrong. That\u2019s because officially naming a thoroughbred comes with some interesting limitations. The names of the Kentucky Derby contenders are often the highlight of the competition. And if you\u2019ve ever wondered how the heck someone came up with a horse name like that, then you\u2019re in luck. We\u2019re here to provide some background. The Kentucky Derby is reserved for 3-year-old thoroughbreds. The Jockey Club, the breed registry for thoroughbred horses in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico, is the organization responsible for approving thoroughbred names.  Although owners can get creative with their selection, it\u2019s common to name a horse after its pedigree, including something involving the name of the horse\u2019s dam (female parent), sire (male parent) or a combination of the names. Some owners also turn to favorite pastimes or words as well as pop culture for inspiration. Then, there are the rules.  As stated on the Jockey Club site, names aren\u2019t eligible if they are more than 18 letters (the Jockey Club seems to work like Twitter, as spaces and punctuation count as letters) or are made up of only initials or only numbers (if you want to use a number above 30, it has to be spelled out, which might make you max out your character limit). Names also can\u2019t end in  filly,   colt,   stud,   mare,   stallion  or related terms. As for jockeys who also might be pop culture junkies, the Jockey Club won\u2019t approve names of living people unless it has written permission. It won\u2019t accept names of those who have died  unless approval is granted by The Jockey Club based upon a satisfactory written explanation submitted to the Registrar.  In addition, names  clearly having commercial, artistic or creative significance  won\u2019t get you anywhere (think movies, songs, etc.).  In a more obvious rule, the Jockey Club will not give the OK for names with  vulgar or obscene meaning  or names that could be offensive  to religious, political or ethnic groups.  In 2007, Slate revealed that some scandalous names (like On Your Knees) had made it to the registry, and Rick Bailey, registrar of the Jockey Club, admitted some  questionable names might have slipped by  because of the high number of submissions.  Did we mention names already in use are out of the picture? The Jockey Club does regularly put out a list of  released  names, though, or names from horses more than 10 years old that haven\u2019t been used for breeding or racing in the last five years. In December 2017, the Jockey Club released 42,659 names. These are just a handful of the rules. There are more guidelines about referencing racetracks in names and trying to give your horse what the Jockey Club considers a  permanent name,  typically designated for horses who win major races or large financial prizes. If the Jockey Club rejects a name, the most common reason is because it\u2019s already been taken. The names might not seem to make sense on the surface, but there are fun stories about the Kentucky Derby horses\u2019 names every year. Aside from horses like Magnum Moon and Good Magic that have names associated with their pedigree, there\u2019s also Bolt D\u2019Oro, a nod to Olympic champion Usain Bolt. Audible\u2019s name was inspired by a tactic used in football, according to the Lexington Herald Leader, and the name Free Drop Billy is rooted in the horse owner\u2019s friend taking frequent free drops (penalty-less moves) while playing golf.  You can thank the owners and their creativity for these fun mini histories \u2015 and the several rules they have to follow, of course. "

There are theories that the phrase is rooted in boxing or poker. However, dictionary publisher Merriam-Webster traced the origins of the expression to the idea that jockeys, when they had such a great lead in a race, would feel confident and relaxed enough to lower their hands, thus  winning hands down.  And as Mental Floss pointed out in 2015, the Oxford English Dictionary also noted the phrase\u2019s origins in horse racing. As time passed,  hands down  adopted a more broad meaning that doesn\u2019t necessarily involve a simple victory. We typically use it now to emphasize that something is indisputable and is often associated with a superlative. For example, someone can have the most beautiful singing voice  hands down  or the coolest wardrobe  hands down.   There are a handful of helpful books that also explain the phrase. Both The Field Guide to Sports Metaphors: A Compendium of Competitive Words and Idioms, published in 2016, and The Language of Horse Racing, published in 2000, give examples of the expression being used in print in the mid-1800s. So this weekend when you\u2019re watching the Kentucky Derby, you can impress your friends with this fun trivia and prove you\u2019re the most intelligent person like, ever hands down. "

Volkswagen did not immediately comment An indictment filed in secret in March was unsealed in U.S. District Court on the same day as Volkswagen\u2019s annual meeting in Germany. Winterkorn resigned soon after the scandal over polluting vehicles in the United States became public in September 2015. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a statement that the charges show  Volkswagen\u2019s scheme to cheat its legal requirements went all the way to the top of the company.  Winterkorn is charged with conspiracy to defraud the United States, wire fraud and violating the Clean Air Act from at least May 2006 through November 2015 by using illicit software that allowed Volkswagen diesel vehicles to emit excess pollution without detection. Volkswagen initially suggested that only lower level executives knew of the cheating. But the indictment alleges Winterkorn was informed of VW\u2019s diesel emissions cheating in May 2014 and in July 2015 and he agreed with other senior VW executives  to continue to perpetrate the fraud and deceive U.S. regulators,  prosecutors said. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office in Detroit said Winterkorn was not in custody. In total, nine people have been charged and two have pleaded guilty in the case. One Italian citizen, a former Audi manager, is in Germany awaiting extradition. Six of the former Volkswagen executives charged are in Germany and have avoided facing U.S. prosecutors because Germany typically does not extradite its citizens.

      "text": "Iowa lawmakers approved a  fetal heartbeat  abortion ban on Wednesday, pushing the state one step closer to having the most restrictive stance on abortion in the country. The bill requires women seeking abortions to submit to an ultrasound to screen for a fetal heartbeat. A fetal heartbeat can typically be detected around six weeks, often before a woman realizes she is pregnant.  If a heartbeat is detected, this bill would ban Iowa\u2019s health care providers from performing an abortion.  The bill was approved by Iowa\u2019s Senate on a 29-17 vote and now heads to the desk of Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds. The governor hasn\u2019t indicated publicly whether she will sign the bill, but she is generally an opponent of abortion rights.   I\u2019m pro-life. I\u2019m proud to be pro-life. I\u2019ve made that very clear,  Reynolds said Wednesday, according to The Associated Press.  Activists on both sides of the abortion rights debate say they expect the bill to be challenged in court. In fact, some anti-abortion activists are hoping the case will make its way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, where President Donald Trump\u2019s appointee, Justice Neil Gorsuch, has effectively created a conservative majority. Abortion opponents hope they now have a shot at challenging Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that acknowledged women\u2019s constitutional right to an abortion.   We created an opportunity to take a run at Roe v. Wade \u2015 100 percent,  Republican state Sen.r Rick Bertrand of Sioux City told Reuters.  Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of Planned Parenthood, called the bill an  extreme and draconian policy that takes aim at a woman\u2019s right to control her own body, life, and future.   This bill is one more example of state politicians, emboldened by the Trump-Pence administration, carrying out policy after policy that strip away people\u2019s freedoms and access to care,  Laguens said in a statement.  The right to control your body includes the right to access safe, legal abortion. Your body is your own, if it is not, we cannot be truly free or equal.  The bill provides exceptions when the woman\u2019s life is in danger. It also allows exceptions in cases of rape or incest \u2015 but only if the woman reports the incident to police or a physician within 45 days for a rape case or 140 days for incest.  Iowa state Rep. Mary Wolfe (D-Clinton) pointed out that child victims of rape are often too scared or don\u2019t know they\u2019re pregnant until they start to show. Making it mandatory for them to report a rape within 45 days, or 6\u00bd weeks, would mean forcing these vulnerable girls to have children. Wolfe called the measure a  blatantly unconstitutional bill that tramples on the liberty of Iowa women.  A Pew Research Center survey from 2014 found that a slim majority of Iowans (52 percent) believe abortion should be legal in all or most cases. Forty-six percent said that the procedure should illegal in all or most cases.  Iowa isn\u2019t the only state seeking to curtail abortion rights. Laws that restrict abortion procedures after 15 weeks in Mississippi and 11 weeks in Kentucky are currently being challenged in those states.  Fetal heartbeat bills were approved in North Dakota and Arkansas in 2013 but were struck down by a federal appeals court. The U.S. Supreme Court at the time declined to review those cases.  "

      "text": "An additional 27 women have come forward to accuse former CBS News host Charlie Rose of sexually harassing them, with the allegations going as far back as 1976, a Washington Post investigation found. The latest allegations follow at least 12 other women accusing Rose, who was fired from his  CBS This Morning  gig in November, of harassing or groping them. PBS, which had aired Rose\u2019s eponymous talk show, also cut ties last fall. Over a five-month period, the Post reported that it interviewed 107 current and former CBS News employees, as well as two dozen others who had worked with Rose on different TV programs. The women accused Rose, now 76, of groping them, exposing himself to them,  appearing naked during work-related visits to his home and otherwise making sexual advances to them. Rose, who did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment on Thursday, denied the latest allegations in an email to The Washington Post, calling the newspaper\u2019s reporting  unfair and inaccurate.  Last fall, Rose had apologized for his behavior, although he said that he  always felt that I was pursuing shared feelings, even though I now realize I was mistaken.  In one of the oldest allegations, Joana Matthias, now 63, told the Post that on one occasion, Rose exposed himself to her and touched her breasts inside NBC News\u2019 Washington bureau in 1976. In another incident, former intern Corrina Collins said Rose squeezed her breast and invited her  to ride him  inside his hotel room when she was traveling with him for work in 2003.  It was a sexual land mine everywhere you stepped,  said former CBS assistant producer Beth Homan-Ross, who alleged that Rose frequently made sexual remarks about her breasts and buttocks and greeted her naked at his home during work visits. Homan-Ross, now 61, was one of seven plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed against CBS alleging an  offensive and hostile  work environment for female employees. The suit was settled under confidential terms in 1987, the Post reported. Not all of the women agreed to share their names publicly, but details of their allegations were corroborated with witnesses or individuals whom the women had confided in, the Post reported. At least two women told the paper that they took their concerns about Rose to higher-ups but that they were told he was harmless. CBS said it had no human resources complaints about Rose. Three of the women whose stories were documented by the Post \u2015 former PBS employee Brooks Harris, CBS executive assistant Chelsea Wei and former PBS assistant Sydney McNeal \u2015 are filing a lawsuit based on their allegations, their attorney Ken Goldberg confirmed to HuffPost. The lawsuit, which will likely be filed in the coming days, will sue several parties, including CBS, Rose and his company, Goldberg said. CBS President David Rhodes, responding to the Post\u2019s report on Thursday, said the network is taking steps to ensure that its employees feel safe.  Since we terminated Charlie Rose, we\u2019ve worked to strengthen existing systems to ensure a safe environment where everyone can do their best work,  he said in a statement obtained by HuffPost.  Some of the actions we have taken have been reported publicly, some have not. We offer employees discretion and fairness, and we take swift action when we learn of unacceptable behavior. That said, we cannot corroborate or confirm many of the situations described,  said Rhodes. In a separate memo sent to employees on Thursday, Rhodes said that the network has sought advice from employment lawyers at the Proskauer law firm and has added mandatory employee training about misconduct.  We\u2019ve seen that best practices in the workplace require a focus not just on sexual misconduct but also on pay practices, diversity, and inclusion,  he said.  We\u2019ve made great strides in these areas in recent years, and we want to be in a leadership role in our industry in every one of these categories.  "

      "text": "PHILADELPHIA \u2015 Before he was the 2018 Super Bowl MVP and a civic hero, quarterback Nick Foles was a gentle, nurturing kid with white-blond hair and giant hands. That\u2019s how I remember him, at least. Nick and I were childhood friends. His size always made him seem older and more imposing than he was. He was quiet and liked to play Nintendo. Our families spent holidays together and visited each other between Texas and Louisiana. Nick\u2019s dad, Larry, had been the manager of a Baton Rouge restaurant where my dad bartended in the late \u201970s. When Nick was 8, my dad took him and my brother duck hunting in Grand Chenier, Louisiana, and Nick was more interested in caring for the injured ducks in the blind after they\u2019d been shot than in hunting them. At one point he got upset because some of the ducks seemed not quite dead. He wanted to end their suffering. So he tried to shoot one on the floor with his BB gun, but he missed, and the BB ricocheted and nailed my dad in the forehead. The Nick Foles who greeted me on Monday in a nondescript office at the Eagles\u2019 Philadelphia training facility was not quite the Nick Foles I knew as a kid. I hadn\u2019t seen him in 20 years. He is 6 feet, 6 inches now and in all ways a bona fide phenomenon. Grown colleagues of mine own shirts with his name on them. Men across Philadelphia have his face tattooed on their bodies. We spoke for an hour about football and fame and faith, about being an apolitical quarterback in a politically charged moment for the NFL, and about his near retirement two years ago and his unusual journey since then, from backup to star to backup again.  Nick! You\u2019re so much bigger than the last time I saw you. I have a picture of you and my brother arm wrestling when you were children.  Eagles PR guy, on his way out of the room: I bet your brother can\u2019t beat him in arm wrestling now. Nick: Taylor? He and I are getting older now, so we\u2019d probably just have a beer and call it a day.  I thought you didn\u2019t drink.  I\u2019ll drink sometimes, usually hard dry cider. I\u2019ve noticed, even though I\u2019m 29, with all the hits and everything, my body just does not feel good when I drink alcohol. We have so much to do throughout the day, and when I\u2019m healthier and on it, I can get more done and still be a dad and a husband. Do you have a vice? Do you ever just go nuts and eat a bag of Hot Cheetos?  I had two autograph signings the last two days for like eight hours, and I didn\u2019t eat yesterday, so I got home and I was starving. And we eat gluten free \u2015 my wife got real sick four years ago, so we\u2019ve had to learn, and it helps me too with inflammation. But I got home and crushed a bag of chips. They were the healthiest chips you can get, made with coconut oil and stuff like that, but I\u2019ll definitely have some gluten-free pizza.  So you don\u2019t have a vice.  [Laughs]  What\u2019s it like to suddenly be famous and see grown men around Philadelphia wearing shirts with your name on it and having tattoos of your face on their bodies?  It\u2019s crazy because when I was here the first time around, we broke a lot of records, I got a lot of notoriety for that here. Philly just loves the Eagles. But when I came back after everything that happened in my career in St. Louis and being a backup in [Kansas City], I wasn\u2019t as noticeable. I could go to the grocery store, and people would recognize me, but it wasn\u2019t a big deal. Now I go anywhere in the nation and it\u2019s a big deal.  Tori [his wife] and I were just in Hawaii on a pretty secluded island, and even there the locals knew who I was. A guy recognized me while I was snorkeling \u2014 it was crazy. People are always very nice. But I would never sit here and say you just get used to it \u2014 I don\u2019t know if anyone\u2019s ever supposed to be used to it.  What\u2019s the weirdest fan encounter you\u2019ve had?  The tattoo things are pretty crazy. I met a guy at a signing the other day \u2014 his whole back was me with a trophy on the  Rocky  steps.  Wow. Was it a good tat? What did you say? I mean, it was his whole back. Forever. There\u2019s not much you can say. I was like,  That\u2019s cool, man.  That\u2019s there forever.  Do you find Eagles fans to be different than fans of other franchises?  Yes. The thing I\u2019ve always admired about Eagles fans is that it\u2019s not fans; it\u2019s family. It\u2019s generational. I was at a signing yesterday and a lady started crying. She said,  I got to watch the game with my 90-year-old mother, and it was the greatest moment of her life, watching the Super Bowl.  Another woman said she was trying to have kids and couldn\u2019t get pregnant, and after the Super Bowl she got pregnant. The doctor said something shifted in her body that allowed her to be pregnant. Stuff like that you hear, and you realize this isn\u2019t just a game for people here.  So there are people in Philadelphia that credit you with their fertility. This team. Yes.  I saw on Instagram that you have a  Rocky  trophy in your locker. Yeah, actually the guy who made the real  Rocky  statue [in Philadelphia] sent me that after the Super Bowl.  It\u2019s funny that you saw that on Instagram. I\u2019ve never been great at social media. With what Tori and I want to do, with helping the community and maybe starting a foundation, it\u2019s important to expand that stuff. But I don\u2019t want it to be a highlight reel of me, I want it to be real. My wife gets sick, Lily [his 10-month-old daughter] hit her head the other day \u2014 stuff goes on. Though beautiful pictures of beaches are wonderful, I want to post things that inspire me \u2014 whether it\u2019s a song or something I read. I\u2019m just trying to home in on using the platform to help people. Because football \u2014 though this is awesome, and it\u2019s great to be in the NFL \u2014 I knew a long time ago this wasn\u2019t where my heart would be. But now because of this, I can help a lot of people through other avenues. I can go and speak, and people want to see me. You\u2019ve said that you want to be a youth pastor after the NFL, right?  The media sort of ran with that. People were like,  Oh, you want to be a pastor! God bless you!  When I was in Kansas City and having a tough time in my career, I decided to go to seminary to continue my spiritual growth. And the youth pastor thing \u2014 we have a great local church at home, and I always thought it would be cool to volunteer at the church. I could teach some sermons in the high school, but it\u2019s more just to be one-on-one and help those kids at that point in their life.  There are so many people on your team from different backgrounds, different religions, different political views. Do you find yourself being a spiritual leader on the team or more kind of leaving everyone alone?  I think everyone knows I\u2019m a Christian. But I just really want to show love to my teammates and show I genuinely care about them and that I\u2019m not trying to be better than anyone. When I\u2019m on a team, it\u2019s all about relationships and just getting to know each other. If you ask me about [University of] Arizona, I probably won\u2019t remember a lot of games, but I\u2019ll remember the locker room. I\u2019ll remember working hard with those guys and that friendship. The NFL\u2019s a little different because guys are in and out all the time, but when I step in the building, I just want to get to know people. I\u2019ll go in the equipment room and chat. When you actually love each other and you go into a game, it\u2019s easier to play. When adversity hits, like in the fourth quarter and stuff goes bad, no one freaks out because you\u2019re like, eh, I got it. We all care for each other. We know we can play. Every team says they\u2019re like family, but this team really is more than any other that I\u2019ve seen. That\u2019s why I believe we won the Super Bowl \u2014 because of the relationships in the locker room. That\u2019s the coolest part of the game. The number one thing I tell kids when I go speak is, if you\u2019re doing this for money, fame, girls, boys, cars, whatever, you\u2019re going to be very empty at the end of it. I can tell you that because I\u2019m who you want to be if you want to be an athlete. I\u2019m a professional athlete. And there\u2019s nothing in there. The newest car\u2019s not going to be good enough. For me it\u2019s my relationship with Christ and my family, that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about.    Do you and your teammates joke around and make fun of each other? Do they have any nicknames for you?   Everyone knows I\u2019m sort of goofy. Some guys are really serious when they play. I\u2019m not. In practice, when I\u2019m throwing with receivers, I\u2019ll work on some no-look throws \u2014 I\u2019ll look left and throw right. No one will ever do that in a game, but to me it\u2019s just sort of fun, and there might be a day I do do it and everyone\u2019s like,  HOW DID YOU DO THAT?  It\u2019s just off-the-wall stuff. We played ultimate frisbee the other day, and I got to be a kid and run around like crazy. Even in games, I try to keep things humorous. If I throw a really bad ball or a long out-of-bounds ball, I\u2019ll say:  Oh wow, that was really good, Nick. Wow.  But I won\u2019t be down on myself, I\u2019ll sort of laugh. An example is, during the Super Bowl I threw a touchdown to Corey Clement, our running back, that was between three defenders, and everything happened so fast. But I went through my reads, and I went to throw to Corey and in my head was like, This looks horrible. This is not how we drew it up. I\u2019m not throwing it. What do I do? And all of a sudden the safety slipped a little bit, a tiny bit, and I was like, Oh I got this. And I threw it, but that\u2019s what went through my head in a split second. And it landed between three guys and he caught it.  I have to touch on Colin Kaepernick and The New York Times story about the owners\u2019 meeting, the talk about going to the White House or not going to the White House. There\u2019s obviously a super politically charged environment in the NFL right now. Some of your teammates have been pretty outspoken about politics, but you\u2019ve stayed out of the fray. Do you think it\u2019s possible to remain apolitical as a star quarterback in the NFL?  I just don\u2019t know a lot about politics, it\u2019s something that I just don\u2019t have a great knowledge in, so I just listen and observe. That\u2019s really it. If I spoke about it, I wouldn\u2019t have a lot of knowledge in it. The character of people, the heart of people, that\u2019s where my focus is. When it comes to political issues, I look at things differently. It\u2019s not necessarily for me to speak. I might have opinions, but I like to listen in those situations, because a lot of times you can say something, but you\u2019re not going to be right either way. So it\u2019s pointless. So you\u2019re staying out of it.  [Laughs] So far.  How do you go from Super Bowl MVP to being a backup again? How do you flip that switch emotionally?  Well, it\u2019s never been done, ever in the NFL, for a Super Bowl MVP to be a backup quarterback. I thought I might have been traded a month ago, because I saw everything in the news, and we\u2019re aware of that because that\u2019s our life. We just moved into a great home here last off season, we have a ten-and-a-half month old, a great place. And if you\u2019re going to be traded, you have to be on your toes. But now that we restructured our deal, and we\u2019re here for at least another year, it\u2019s honestly a great opportunity to impact a lot of people, because a lot of people are gonna look at me and say,  Alright, let\u2019s see how he really responds. Let\u2019s see how he really acts. Let\u2019s see who he really is.  And pride does seep in, you know. You see a Super Bowl ad and you\u2019re like, wow, that\u2019s crazy! And you\u2019d love the opportunity to start. But you have to reel back in. I think everyone deals with that in some sort of fashion. You know, it\u2019s humbling. I have to humble myself daily to come in here and be a backup quarterback, sit in meetings, and I\u2019m not the starter, though two months ago we were on stage holding the Lombardi Trophy. But it\u2019s good for me. I\u2019m learning a lot about myself and growing in ways I never could imagine. Everyone else looks at it like,  Oh, you should be starting, you should be getting paid this,  and it gets in your head a little bit, and then you have to get it out. Because it doesn\u2019t matter. You really have to just focus on now and just being grateful. It goes back to perspective, like my family \u2014 seeing my daughter and my wife. We\u2019re happy. We have great people here. Just sort of enjoying the moment, because eventually football will be over.  What was it like going up against Tom Brady after having been a backup in the same season? How did you not crack under the pressure? Were you nervous?  I didn\u2019t know how my body was going to respond, because it\u2019s such a big stage. You know how you\u2019re going to prepare, but you never know until you step on that field how it\u2019s going to happen. Because you always prepare to succeed, but guys have bad games. My focus was staying in the moment, staying present. It\u2019s easy to look at the big picture and freak out, but we say,  Be where your feet are.  Like right now, I\u2019m present, I\u2019m talking to you. That\u2019s where I am. My mind isn\u2019t wandering. And with that it sort of clears the clutter in your mind. Every day I get up, make coffee, read scripture. I was journaling every day during that time, because there were so many emotions I was dealing with, for leaving the team and being in that situation.  So I felt good going into the game, but I remember sitting there for the national anthem, and I was taking everything in. And I knew the first play of the game was a pass, and on that play I\u2019d sort of get an idea of how my body\u2019s doing, how my heart\u2019s doing, how my mind \u2014 like, is everything calm? Then I dropped back, our first read was covered and did a hard reset all the way across the field and threw it to Nelson Agholor for a completion, and I remember right then I thought, I feel really really good. It was probably the most relaxed I\u2019ve ever played in a game, was in the Super Bowl, because I was just very present. The stage didn\u2019t get too big. And I really believe the reason I was so calm is because I have great teammates and that they\u2019re very talented and work hard and do what they\u2019re supposed to do. Not once this year did the offense get mad when the defense played bad, or the defense get mad when the offense played bad. That showed our team we always had each other\u2019s backs. Is that different from other teams you\u2019ve been on?  Yeah. I\u2019ve been on teams, I don\u2019t want to name them, but the attention to detail wasn\u2019t great. Schematically, we weren\u2019t great. Great guys, good people, but we didn\u2019t have a strong identity, and going into the games was very stressful, very tough. And I remember having a lot of trouble \u2014 like I\u2019ve always thrown for 300-400 yards a game since I was in high school, and it was this one year of my life playing the sport where we could barely get over 150 in a game, where I was used to throwing for that in a quarter. And it was very tough. But there\u2019s a lot of growth that happened that year. I talk a lot to younger guys, and money can blind them. I mean, when you play, you should get paid for what you do. But make sure you go somewhere with a good system, good coaches. The grass isn\u2019t always greener on the other side. It\u2019s miserable if you get on a team and you aren\u2019t playing well and everyone turns against each other. And I\u2019ve experienced that. I thought I was going to retire two years ago. That was real. That was 100 percent. I was done. It is because you lost faith in yourself and thought you weren\u2019t good anymore?  I knew I could still play \u2015 they knew I could still play at an extremely high level. I just did not like football. I couldn\u2019t touch a football. Someone would throw me a football, and I would just drop it. I\u2019d had enough, I\u2019d lost the joy. I can\u2019t do something without my heart. I think something inside me was going on, there was so much fear to play again. It wasn\u2019t that I didn\u2019t think I could play, I just had a horrible experience and it just blinded me. But I knew there would be more growth in playing than in stepping away.  And I knew I brought so much joy to my dad and my father-in-law and my family and the people watching, and [the idea of taking that away from them] hurt. They\u2019ll watch me play the game, and it provides so much happiness and escape. My dad has rewatched the Super Bowl probably a hundred times. My father-in-law just watched it again last night. That\u2019s really sweet! My dad spent years trying to teach me how to throw a football correctly, giving me physics lectures about how my arm is like a whip. Are you going to do that to your daughter?  I\u2019ll probably teach her how to throw a football. I really just want to do everything I can to love her and just be daddy. But I think she\u2019ll have some good athletic genes \u2014 my wife is more athletic than me. She played volleyball at Arizona. She\u2019s 5-foot-10, can run, jump. And Lily\u2019s like, top percentile in length. She\u2019ll just get a toy and throw it across the room. You want to see some pictures of her? "

      "text": "Several male supervisors at a Verizon-contracted warehouse in Memphis, Tennessee, groped, sexually propositioned and harassed eight current and former female employees, according to charges the women filed last month at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the federal agency that handles civil rights employment cases. One woman says her boss at the fulfillment center, where workers pack and ship Verizon products, came by to offer her a peppermint, dropped it in her hand, then reached down and grabbed her breast. Another woman\u2019s boss grabbed her buttocks while he was walking by with a colleague, according to her complaint. After she reported the incident to the human resources department, her boss treated her more  harshly,  and wrote her up for not working \u2015 falsely, she says in the complaint. She quit in January. Filed in two batches at the EEOC in early and late April, the charges show what pervasive, systemic sexual harassment looks like for low-wage workers of color \u2015 the warehouse workers are primarily African American \u2015 who are often an afterthought in the recent spate of Me Too stories, which tend to focus on high-profile men and more elite, typically white, women. While the first batch of charges got some local press attention, the discrimination claims filed in late April have not been previously reported. In this case, the discrimination charges were not filed against Verizon nor do they involve the company\u2019s employees. Instead, workers have filed their claims against their direct employer, XPO Logistics, a multibillion-dollar global firm that owns the warehouse and contracts with Verizon. On Wednesday, ahead of Verizon\u2019s shareholder meeting, the National Women\u2019s Law Center, a women\u2019s economic rights nonprofit, and four other groups sent a letter to Verizon CEO and chairman Lowell McAdam, urging him to address complaints of sexual harassment at the Memphis facility. Other signers include the women\u2019s nonprofit A Better Balance, the Tennessee branch of the NAACP and SisterReach, a women\u2019s rights nonprofit that is focused of women of color in the South. The president of SAG-AFTRA, a union that represents actors, singers and other entertainers, also signed on.  The XPO warehouse reportedly exhibits a toxic culture that runs contrary to Verizon\u2019s stated policies and practices,  says the letter, provided exclusively to HuffPost on Tuesday. The letter notes that McAdam has been a vocal supporter of women\u2019s rights. The CEO recently proclaimed a zero tolerance policy for harassment at Makers, a women\u2019s conference run by Verizon-owned Oath. (Oath is also HuffPost\u2019s parent company.)  As community leaders, and women\u2019s rights advocates engaged in legal and policy work to fight against sexual harassment and active in the Times Up and MeToo campaigns and movements, we are deeply concerned with how Verizon ensures safe and dignified working conditions for the workers in its supply chain,  the letter says. The writers ask for a meeting with Verizon to further discuss the situation. HuffPost alerted Verizon to the letter on Tuesday night. The company said this was the first it heard about the situation in Memphis.  We are undertaking an immediate investigation into the matter,  Verizon spokesman Bob Varettoni told HuffPost on Wednesday, after looking at the charges.  Later that day, lawyers from both companies met to discuss the allegations, according to a letter sent to XPO from Verizon, broadly outlining their discussion and next steps.  These are very disturbing and serious allegations,  Verizon\u2019s attorneys write.  Verizon expects XPO Logistics to utilize all measures available to fully investigate the charges and take prompt and decisive remedial action if the facts warrant it.  Verizon also said that it expects frequent updates on the investigation and that it will monitor XPOs actions. The updates and investigation will  inform the basis of any decisions Verizon makes regarding the future of our contractual relationship with XPO.  The letter was addressed to two XPO executives, including in-house lawyer Richard Valitutto. According to the harassment charges, Valitutto was also employed by the warehouse\u2019s previous owners, New Breed Logistics, when it was sued for sexual harassment in 2010. The company lost that case, and a judge ordered the warehouse to closely monitor for sexual harassment issues. It\u2019s not clear what happened after that. A spokesman for XPO declined to comment on the specifics of the claims but said that the company had only reviewed the charges filed in early April and had not yet seen the late April filings.  Our culture promotes safety and respect. We have no tolerance for any form of harassment,  an XPO spokesman told HuffPost.  We promptly investigate all claims brought to our attention.  The charges raise questions about the responsibilities big companies have in dealing with the behavior of their contractors. It\u2019s a struggle that\u2019s somewhat analogous to what happens in the retail industry, where big labels outsource manufacturing overseas. Other tech firms, including Facebook, do hold their contractors to various standards \u2015 including minimum wages and benefits requirements. Many, including Verizon, say they have zero tolerance for harassment at any firm they do business with. Those kind of policies will increasingly be put to the test as the Me Too movement matures. It\u2019s possible that the next phase will spread to these fairly common arrangements, where big-name companies outsource labor needs to U.S. companies with a far lower profile.  Part of this moment demands greater accountability for preventing and addressing workplace harassment,  said Emily Martin, general counsel at the National Women\u2019s Law Center, which has signed on to the letter. Companies like Verizon should pay attention not only to the treatment of their own workers but also to those who fall under their corporate umbrella, she said. They have a lot of power to make change.  Verizon has a really important voice around the conversation they should use that power to stand up for the workers who are trying to seek justice,  said Martin, who also oversees some legal work for Time\u2019s Up, the anti-harassment initiative created by women in Hollywood in the wake of the Me Too movement. The women who filed these claims are hourly workers who don\u2019t earn a lot of money, and many are the sole breadwinners for their family, grateful for the hourly work and full-time benefits, despite the hazards of the job, said Gloria Sweet-Love, president of the NAACP in Tennessee, which signed the letter. The racial aspects of the harassment allegations are hard to miss, as the female workers at the plant are mainly African American and their supervisors\u2019 mostly white men, according to the letter from the groups. One woman alleging discrimination said her supervisor regularly made sexual comments to the women who worked under him, calling one his  chocolate baby.   They\u2019re getting the same kind of racist pathetic treatment that people in the South got for generations,  said Sweet-Love, who noted she\u2019s met with many workers inside the XPO facility, where employees are often working long and inconsistent hours, desperate to hang on to the full-time work that comes with benefits \u2015 a rarity for low-wage workers in Memphis.  These eight women are just the tip of the iceberg. There are so many more. Everybody in there is being mistreated and overworked,  she said. The facility\u2019s previous owner, New Breed Logistics, was sued by the EEOC in 2010 for harassment and retaliation involving three female temp workers in Memphis. A jury found in favor of the victims, with a $1.5 million judgment. A federal judge ordered the company to monitor complaints and issues going forward. However, while the case was on appeal, XPO bought the facility. Verizon contracted with New Breed, as well. According to the lawyer who filed the current crop of charges, XPO continues to employ executives who were there when the last suit was filed, including its human resources director and corporate counsel Valitutto.  This article has been updated with details of Verizon\u2019s letter to XPO.  Have you experienced sexual harassment or discrimination where you work? HuffPost wants to talk to you.

      "text": "Several cheerleaders for the Washington NFL team revealed to The New York Times on Wednesday that their jobs often take them off the field and into sexually charged situations with men who sponsor the team.  The report adds to the growing pile of evidence that NFL cheerleaders across the league are forced to work under unfair conditions, and, as suggested by the women who spoke to the Times, often beyond the confines of their jobs on the football field. During a 2013 calendar photo shoot trip to Costa Rica, the cheerleaders said, the team invited a group of all-male sponsors and FedExField suite holders to watch the squad members pose topless or in nothing but body paint for their photos. After one 14-hour working day on the trip, the cheerleading director told nine of the women that some male sponsors had  picked them to be personal escorts at a nightclub  that night. The director\u2019s request did not appear optional, they said.   So get back to your room and get ready,  the director told them. Several of them began to cry. The cheerleaders noted that their escorting duties did not require them to have sex with the men.  Stephanie Jojokian, the squad\u2019s longtime director and choreographer, dismissed the suggestion that the club night was mandatory. The team issued a statement stating that the cheerleaders are  contractually protected to ensure a safe and constructive environment.  The team confirmed to the Times that the cheerleaders were paid nothing for the weeklong trip, though their transportation costs, meals and lodging were covered. The cheerleaders also said they felt alarmed when, upon arrival at the resort where the photo shoot was taking place, team officials collected all their passports from them \u2015 a safety precaution, they said.  They also recounted mandatory  bonding  parties that took place on the yacht of longtime team suite holder William R. Teel Jr. with several of his friends.  One of the cheerleaders who spoke to the Times described a similar pressure to participate in the events on the yacht.  One cheerleader a few years later was told what to expect at the annual affair.  I\u2019d been given a heads-up that we were going on this particular man\u2019s yacht and that he had a lot of money \u2014 and that you could make a lot of money there if you wanted,  one cheerleader said, referring to the prize money in the dance contests.  But that was not for me, and lots of us felt the same way. But we were too scared to complain. We felt that our place on the team would be compromised if we did.  Wednesday\u2019s report comes on the heels of several other scandals plaguing the NFL\u2019s cheerleading programs.  In March, a New Orleans Saints cheerleader filed a lawsuit against the NFL citing an unfair double standard over the rules for the team\u2019s female and male employees after she was fired for violating a cheerleader-specific social media policy. The following month, a Miami Dolphins cheerleader filed a suit against the league after she said she became  a target of discipline, ridicule, harassment and abuse  from the team\u2019s cheerleading director after she posted a photo on social media of her recent baptism. UPDATE: May 3 \u2015 Team president Bruce Allen released a statement Thursday saying the organization is  looking into the situation  and that several current and former cheerleaders have given  very different first-hand accounts that directly contradict  the Times\u2019 report.

      "text": "Actress Cate Blanchett has revealed that she too was sexually harassed by Harvey Weinstein and said that she hopes the disgraced Hollywood producer and other accused sexual predators, including Woody Allen, face justice  through the judicial system.   I\u2019m interested in those people being prosecuted. We have to set a legal precedent,  she said in a Variety interview published Wednesday. When asked if Weinstein ever sexually harassed her, she said yes but declined to lay out the details, noting only that she  wouldn\u2019t do what he was asking me to do.   I think he really primarily preyed, like most predators, on the vulnerable,  the two-time Oscar winner said of Weinstein.  I mean, I got a bad feeling from him. \u2026 He would often say to me, \u2018We\u2019re not friends.\u2019  In the extensive interview ahead of next week\u2019s Cannes Film Festival, where she will serve as president of the jury, Blanchett also spoke up for Dylan Farrow, who has accused Allen of molesting herwhen she was 7 years old.  Obviously, Dylan Farrow has been living in a world of pain, and if the case has not been properly tried, then it needs to be reopened and go back into court because that\u2019s a place where those things get solved,  Blanchett said. Both Weinstein and Allen have denied all sexual assault allegations. However, Blanchett hesitated when asked if she would no longer work with Allen, who wrote and directed  Blue Jasmine,  for which she won the Best Actress Oscar. She said that when she took the role, she did not know of Farrow\u2019s allegations against the writer and director. Amid the Me Too and Time\u2019s Up movements, renewed attention on Farrow\u2019s allegations has driven several major stars to distance themselves from Allen in recent months. (Others have continued to defend Allen.)  Far more important than me adding to yet another headline \u2026 and finger-pointing is, if that issue has not been dealt with \u2026 I am absolutely for it to go back into the courts because there lies the solution,  Blanchett said.  There are many male directors who I have heard about and have not necessarily had positive experiences with whom I would not work with again who didn\u2019t lay a finger on me at all,  she continued.  There are many reasons why one doesn\u2019t want to work with people again.  Blanchett also responded to criticism that rich actresses should not discuss pay disparities, revealing that she recently turned down a role because she would have been paid less than her male co-star.  If an actor is making a profound and pivotal contribution, then they should be remunerated accordingly. And when that remuneration is different, purely because of your gender, that\u2019s just ridiculous,  she said.  It\u2019s a marker of how much you\u2019re creatively valued within the equation. You want to be valued for your work.  Read the full Variety interview here. "

      "text": "A Catholic high school in Dearborn, Michigan, has come under fire for its plan to pass out  modesty ponchos  to female students if their dresses are deemed inappropriate at their upcoming prom dance.  The colorful modesty ponchos appeared on mannequins in the halls of Divine Child High School on Monday morning. The ponchos look similar to rain ponchos and, according to a note left on a mannequin, are available in  short and long styles.    If your dress does not meet our formal dance dress requirements \u2015 no problem! We\u2019ve got you covered \u2015 literally. This is our Modesty Poncho, which you\u2019ll be given at the door,  a note attached to another mannequin reads.  The modesty ponchos came under swift criticism from students and parents alike, forcing the school to backtrack in a letter sent to the school community Tuesday. High school principal Eric Haley wrote in the letter that the ponchos were not meant to make students feel uncomfortable and were meant  to remind all students and parents of our formal Prom dress policy.   To be clear: The poncho will not be passed out at Prom. It was on display to proactively remind students of our dress code policies and eliminate any confusion prior to this special event,  Haley wrote to students and parents.  We recognize that it has done the opposite for some members of our community and draws away from our goal of having students adhere to the dress code policy.  According to the school\u2019s dress code, obtained by local news outlet Fox 2, female students cannot wear low necklines or  cutouts below the traditional bra line  to the May 12 prom dance.  The modesty ponchos were created by theology teacher Mary Pat O\u2019Malley, who said she hoped the poncho would help people see  inner beauty.   We are trying to focus on the inner beauty of people and not draw attention to something that doesn\u2019t really need to have attention drawn to it,  she said.  It\u2019s really intended as a deterrent \u2014 and a lighthearted one at that.   An anonymous Divine Child student told Fox 2 on Monday that she thought the school had  gone very far  with the ponchos and was not comfortable attending her own prom.  A parent added that the poncho would body-shame young girls.   It\u2019s a method of shaming, a method of building and degrading to females and its interpretation what\u2019s modest and what isn\u2019t,  the anonymous parent told Fox 2.  While the modesty ponchos will no longer be handed out at prom, Haley wrote that teachers will  provide wraps and shawls  \u2015 as the school has done at past events \u2015 to female students if necessary.

      "text": "A producer on the canceled Netflix show  Marco Polo  has accused disgraced film mogul Harvey Weinstein of repeated sexual assault and abuse over a period of years, according to documents filed with the New York Supreme Court on Monday. Alexandra Canosa describes at least 11 alleged incidents in the filing, including rape, other unspecified sexual assault, physical assault, verbal threats, forced sex acts and other abuses between 2010 and 2017. Locations included rooms and suites in various hotels, she says, such as Manhattan\u2019s Tribeca Grand Hotel, Beverly Hills\u2019 Peninsula Hotel and Budapest\u2019s Four Seasons Hotel. Weinstein  made it clear that if she did not succumb to his demands for sexual contact or if she exposed his unwanted conduct there would be retaliation, including humiliation, the loss of her job and loss of any ability to work in the entertainment business,  the filing alleges. Canosa was formerly employed by The Weinstein Company, led by Weinstein until he stepped down in October.  Dozens of women, working in front of the camera and behind the scenes alike, have leveled accusations against Weinstein, who has become a pariah in Hollywood. Canosa initially filed her suit in December, but has detailed her claims publicly for the first time this week. The court filing alleges at least one instance of rape. Canosa says Weinstein raped her in Malaysia, where parts of  Marco Polo  were filmed, in May 2014. The series debuted in December of that year.  In August 2017, weeks before The New York Times and The New Yorker would publish a series of damning accusations against the former studio head, Weinstein  verbally threatened  Canosa  not to speak to anyone about his abuse,  the filing alleges. Echoing the accounts of dozens of other accusers, Canosa says Weinstein ensured that she met with him alone under the pretense of doing work. He allegedly made inappropriate demands,  forcing himself on [her] despite repeated requests to stop,  the filing says. In a statement provided to Variety, Phyllis Kupferstein, an attorney for Weinstein, said the relationship between Weinstein and Canosa was consensual.   Ali Canosa was a friend who had worked for The Weinstein Company for 10 years, traveled the world for the company and held several influential roles; overseeing many projects throughout the years,  Kupferstein said in the statement.  From someone who has been thought of as a good friend, involved only in a consensual relationship, these claims are not only mystifying to Mr. Weinstein, but deeply upsetting, and they are not supported by the facts.  Canosa claims that other defendants named in her suit \u2015 including Harvey Weinstein\u2019s brother, Robert, and several Weinstein Company board members \u2015 were aware of Weinstein\u2019s behavior and did nothing to stop him. By USA Today\u2019s count, more than 80 women have come forward to accuse Weinstein of sexual misconduct, a blanket term for a range of abuses. He has denied engaging in nonconsensual sex, and is reportedly in and out of treatment for sex addiction and anger management at a facility in Arizona.  The Weinstein Company, now bankrupt, is facing a sale. "

Koxa mastered the monster 80-footer off the coast of Nazar\u00e9, Portugal, in November. His record-breaking feat only became official Saturday, when it was recognized with the Quiksilver XXL Biggest Wave Award at a World Surf League ceremony in Los Angeles.  The award goes to the surfer who, by any means available, catches the biggest wave of the year,  the league said in a statement.  Not only did Koxa win this year\u2019s honor, but he now holds the Guinness World Record for the biggest wave surfed.  The previous record was set in 2011 by Garrett McNamara, who rode a 78-foot wave, also at Nazar\u00e9, authenticated by the Billabong XXL Global Big Wave Awards judging committee, and confirmed by Guinness. Here\u2019s his ride: Other surfers \u2014 including McNamara \u2014 have claimed they broke the 2011 record, but Koxa\u2019s ride is the only one that has been confirmed by the WSL and Guinness records.  I got a present from God,  Koxa told The Inertia online surf news site after the awards ceremony.  It was the best present I\u2019ve ever had.  Koxa said he almost was killed in 2014 at Nazar\u00e9, where many of the world\u2019s biggest surfing waves are.   For months later, I had bad dreams, I didn\u2019t travel, I got scared, and my wife helped me psychologically,  he said.  Now, I\u2019m just so happy.  Among other honors handed out Saturday, the award for Wipeout of the Year went to British surfer Andrew Cotton, who broke his back in a horrific fall at Nazar\u00e9. He\u2019s still recovering and plans to return soon to surfing, the WSL statement said. "

Kelly struck back at the Time\u2019s Up campaign on Monday, saying the group\u2019s efforts are  unjust and off-target  after it called for an investigation into the multiple allegations against the singer of abusing women. The 51-year-old singer, whose full name is Robert Kelly, has faced accusations of sexual abuse for years, including allegations that he was involved in sex slavery and sexual abuse of minors. Time\u2019s Up, an initiative started by women in Hollywood to fight sexual abuse and exploitation, on Monday called for an investigation into the allegations against Kelly and launched a social media campaign called #MuteRKelly. In a statement, a representative for the singer expressed support for the Time\u2019s Up movement while arguing that the accusations against Kelly are unwarranted.  R. Kelly supports the pro-women goals of the Time\u2019s Up movement. We understand criticizing a famous artist is a good way to draw attention to those goals \u2014 and in this case, it is unjust and off-target,  the statement reads.  We fully support the rights of women to be empowered to make their own choices. Time\u2019s Up has neglected to speak with any of the women who welcome R. Kelly\u2019s support, and it has rushed to judgment without the facts.  Kelly\u2019s representative also said it would ultimately  become clear  that the singer is the target of a  greedy, conscious and malicious conspiracy to demean him.   R. Kelly\u2019s music is a part of American and African-American culture that should never \u2015 and will never \u2015 be silenced,  the statement said.  Since America was born, black men and women have been lynched for having sex or for being accused of it.  Representatives for Kelly did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. The #MuteRKelly campaign has been promoted on Twitter by prominent black women in the Time\u2019s Up movement, including television showrunner Shonda Rhimes, director Ava DuVernay and #MeToo founder Tarana Burke.  Some have pointed out that Kelly\u2019s alleged victims are themselves women of color, which seemingly undercuts his argument that he\u2019s being targeted because he is a black man. The statement released by Time\u2019s Up on Monday came from the group\u2019s Women of Color committee, who wrote that they hope to  shine a bright light on our WOC sisters in need.    Y\u2019all. This has been a long, hard, fought journey that SO MANY sisters have been on for more than a decade,  Burke wrote Monday on Twitter.  This man is a predator and 100% of his victims have been Black and Brown girls. At times it felt like screaming into a well, but thank God for this reckoning coming.  On Sunday, Kelly posted a video to his Twitter account where he blamed  rumors  for the recent cancellation of a show he\u2019d been slated to give at the University of Illinois at Chicago. The singer also hinted at possible legal action for the incident.   I don\u2019t know why they canceled the show,  Kelly said in the video.  I\u2019ve never heard of a show being canceled because of rumors, but I guess there\u2019s a first time for everything.  Kelly is still scheduled to perform at the Greensboro Coliseum in North Carolina on May 11. "

      "text": "By Greg Roumeliotis (Reuters) - T-Mobile US Inc agreed on Sunday to acquire peer Sprint Corp, in an all-stock deal for $26 billion that will combine the third and fourth largest U.S. wireless carriers and is expected to attract regulatory scrutiny over its impact on consumers. The agreement caps four years of on- and off- talks between the companies, setting the stage for the creation of a carrier with 127 million customers that will be a more formidable competitor to the No.1 and No. 2 wireless players, Verizon Communications Inc and AT&T Inc. U.S. regulators, which have challenged in court AT&T\u2019s $85 billion deal to buy U.S. media company Time Warner Inc, are expected to grill Sprint and T-Mobile on how they will price their combined wireless offerings. The breakthrough in the companies\u2019 negotiations, first reported by Reuters on Thursday, came after T-Mobile majority-owner Deutsche Telekom AG and Japan\u2019s SoftBank Group Corp, which controls Sprint, agreed on a structure that will allow Deutsche Telekom to continue to consolidate the combined company, which will have a market value of over $80 billion, on its books. Deutsche Telekom will own 42 percent of the combined company, and will control the board of the combined company, nominating nine of the 14 directors. The implied equity valuation for Sprint is $6.62 per share based on T-Mobile\u2019s closing share price on Friday. The all-stock transaction is at a fixed exchange ratio of 0.10256 T-Mobile shares for eachSprint share, or the equivalent of 9.75 Sprint shares for each T-Mobile US share. Sprint\u2019s and T-Mobile\u2019s first round of merger talks ended unsuccessfully in 2014 after U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s administration expressed antitrust concerns about the deal. Under U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, regulators have continued to fret about consumer prices. The U.S. government has opened a probe into alleged coordination by AT&T, Verizon Communications and a telecommunications standards organization to hinder consumers from easily switching wireless carriers, a person briefed on the matter said earlier this month. The second round of talks between Sprint and T-Mobile ended in November over valuation disagreements, although Deutsche Telekom CEO Tim Hoettges, left the door open at the time, saying:  You always meet twice in life.  Since then, Sprint\u2019s shares lost about a fifth of their value amid questions about how the company can compete effectively under the weight of its long-term debt of more than $32 billion. Softbank has been looking to trim its own debt as well, which reached 15.8 trillion yen ($147 billion) as of the end of December. It has said it is planning to raise cash by taking its Japanese mobile phone unit public this year. Failure to clinch a deal last November left SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son, a dealmaker who raised close to $100 billion for his Vision Fund to invest in technology companies, in search of other options for Sprint. Even though Sprint\u2019s customer base has expanded under CEO Marcelo Claure, growth has been driven by discounting. Analysts say that, without T-Mobile, Sprint lacks the scale needed to invest in its network and to compete in a saturated market. T-Mobile has fared better than Sprint, even if it remains a distant third to Verizon and AT&T. It has managed to score sustained market share gains, as innovative offerings, improving network performance and good customer service attract new customers, according to Moody\u2019s Investors Service Inc. T-Mobile became the first major U.S. carrier to eliminate two-year contracts, a shift quickly embraced by consumers and copied by competitors. The company has also badgered rivals with its unlimited data plans. Both Sprint and T-Mobile are far behind Verizon and AT&T in upgrading their network to accommodate next generation 5G wireless technology. Even after their merger, the combined company\u2019s budget to invest in 5G will be smaller than Verizon or AT&T\u2019s. However, Sprint and T-Mobile hope the deal will give them more firepower to participate in auction for spectrum to develop 5G. They plan to participate in a spectrum auction in late fall.

A first-team All-American from the University of Central Florida, Griffin hasn\u2019t allowed the loss of his hand to deter him from becoming one of the best football players in the country. At the NFL scouting combine back in February, Griffin performed 20 repetitions of 225 pounds in the bench press using a prosthetic attachment in place of his amputated hand.

Quite a few high-profile athletes who represented the U.S. at the 2018 Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games were conspicuously absent from the gathering, pointedly avoiding meeting a president with whom they disagree on plenty of issues. Among those missing: Lindsey Vonn, Gus Kenworthy and Adam Rippon, three athletes who have previously made their political differences with Trump known. Rippon, who called out Vice President Mike Pence during the Games for his anti-LGBTQ track record, seized the opportunity Friday to once again highlight this administration\u2019s discriminatory policies: Instead of attending, Rippon made donations to GLAAD, Planned Parenthood and the American Red Cross, and encouraged his followers to do the same: Kenworthy knew he\u2019d boycott the event visit since before the games started, telling CNN in February he  would definitely decline  the White House visit.  When we were at our team processing, where everyone gets fitted for an Olympic ring they said: \u2018Hey, you can pick this up at the White House visit,\u2019  Kenworthy said.  And I said, \u2018I\u2019m not going to that\u2019 and they were like, \u2018Yeah, most of the athletes aren\u2019t\u2019.  Team USA didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request from HuffPost seeking a tally of the athletes who didn\u2019t attend Friday. Also missing were Erin Hamlin (Team USA\u2019s Olympic flag-bearer), Chloe Kim, Jessie Diggins and David Wise. Hamlin told USA Today she\u2019d be visiting the Johns Hopkins Children\u2019s Center Friday morning instead of meeting Trump. And while five Olympians \u2014 Stacey Cook, Maddie Phaneuf, Arielle Gold and the aforementioned Diggins and Wise \u2014 were on Capitol Hill Wednesday to brief lawmakers on climate change on behalf of a group called Protect Our Winters, not all of them made it over to the White House to meet with Trump later in the week. Protect Our Winters spokesperson Samantha Killgore told USA Today the athletes had made the Congressional briefing a priority over the White House visit and wouldn\u2019t make it. Photos from the White House event show Gold in attendance, however, so it\u2019s unclear who from the group actually skipped out.  Per USA Today, most of the 2018 U.S. Olympic figure skating team was also absent, though not necessarily for political reasons. Many are on tour with  Stars on Ice  and simply couldn\u2019t fit it into their schedules. "

      "text": "Running phenomenon Caster Semenya of South Africa and some other top females runners will likely have to reduce their body\u2019s natural testosterone levels under new rules to continue to compete in top international races. The new rules issued Thursday by the International Association of Athletics Federations set strict limits on testosterone levels for women and  intersex  athletes in women\u2019s races. They represent a continuing struggle over how to create fair competition amid increased sensitivity and understanding about what constitutes gender in the  binary  sports establishment.  Just as the rules were announced, a leading IAAF scientist said he predicts a third  intersex  category could be established in the next five to 10 years in international competition. For now, beginning in November, the blood testosterone level must be 5 nanomoles per liter for a continuous period of at least six months for an athlete to compete in a women\u2019s event under the new IAAF track rules. The new levels, down from 10 nmol/L, will apply to all athletes with a  difference of sexual development  designation and will include only female or  intersex  athletes, not athletes designated as male, who would be barred from women\u2019s competition. The levels will apply to athletes competing in international women\u2019s events from 400 meters to the mile. The IAAF had defended its decision by saying the typical range among elite female athletes is 0.12 to 1.79 nmol/L, according to NPR. If athletes the IAAF refers to as  hyperandrogenous women  don\u2019t lower their testosterone to the new levels, they will only be allowed to compete with men or intersex athletes under the new rules, in longer events or in lower profile, non-international races.  The IAAF\u2019s new regulations are an attempt to avoid battles over gender by sticking to the basic math of hormone blood levels, specifically testosterone. High levels of endogenous testosterone can significantly enhance sporting performance.   The revised rules are not about cheating. They are about leveling the playing field to ensure fair and meaningful competition,  IAAF President Sebastian Coe said in a statement Thursday.   Like many other sports, we choose to have two classifications for our competition \u2015 men\u2019s events and women\u2019s events. This means we need to be clear about the competition criteria for these two categories. Our evidence and data show that testosterone ... provides significant performance advantages in female athletes.   The IAAF statement said that the new regulations are  in no way intended as any kind of judgement on or questioning of the sex or the gender identity of any athlete.  A court suspended testosterone levels set by IAAF in 2011 until the organization could prove high levels of the hormone provided an unfair edge in competition, which the IAAF says it has now done. The levels were criticized at the time as specifically targeted at Semenya, whose victories appeared to be hurt by the lowered levels. Her wins increased again when the new testosterone levels were suspended in 2015. But Dr. Stephane Bermon, head of IAFF\u2019s health and science department, told The Guardian that the testosterone issue affects many female athletes, not just Semenya.  It is not just the one or two people you hear about in the media,  Berman said.  In elite female athletics the number of intersex athletes is 140 times more than what you might find in the normal female population.  Bermon, who foresees an intersex competitive category in the future, insisted that restricting competition based on testosterone is fair \u2014 and does not penalize a natural gift.  The reason why we have separate male and female categories is that otherwise females would never win any medals,  Bermon said.  Testosterone is the most important factor in explaining the difference. We are talking about females competing with levels similar to males.  Semenya, 27, who won Olympic gold in the women\u2019s 800-meter races at London 2012 and Rio 2016, didn\u2019t immediately respond to the announcement of the new regulations, but last year she called IAAF\u2019s study of athletes and testosterone levels  nonsense.  She also had an angry tweet Thursday: Semenya was ordered to undergo gender testing in 2009, the year she won the 800-meter at the World Championships in Berlin at the age of 18. The results were never publicly released, and she was cleared to compete again the following year. She complained then she had been subjected to  unwarranted and invasive scrutiny of the most intimate and private details of my being  that  infringed on not only my rights as an athlete but also my fundamental and human rights.  The new IAAF rules could be challenged again in court. "

In a Friday interview with  Good Morning America  host George Stephanopolous, Cosby\u2019s publicists went so far as to compare the disgraced comedian to Emmett Till, the black teenager who was mutilated and murdered in Mississippi in 1955.  This became a public lynching,  Cosby spokesman Andrew Wyatt said on the program.  You\u2019re saying all these women, all 60 women, are lying?  Stephanopolous asked.  May I ask a question?  Cosby spokeswoman Ebonee Benson said.  Since when are all people honest? Since when are all women honest? We can take a look at Emmett Till, for example. Not all people are honest.  Till, who was 14 when he died, was lynched after a white woman falsely claimed that he had briefly and crudely accosted her. His death and the acquittal of his accused killers became a symbol of how the American justice system places far less value on black lives. The woman recently admitted she\u2019d lied. Stephanopolous appeared visibly frustrated by Benson\u2019s response. Wyatt then went after lawyer Gloria Allred, who has been representing Cosby\u2019s accusers.  What Gloria Allred was able to do, what she did, was take a salt-and-pepper shaker \u2014 she shaked out a lot of salt and sprinkled in a little black pepper,  Wyatt said.  And the south came east. And that\u2019s what we saw.  The 60 women who have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct include multiple black women. "

      "text": "A pair of former Disney executives have created a new social media platform for girls.  On Friday, Brooke Chaffin and Catherine Connors announced the launch of Maverick, a social network geared toward young women between the ages of 10 and 20. The aim is to connect and empower girls by fostering their creativity and introducing them to inspiring role models.  When users join Maverick, which offers both a free iOS app and desktop experience, they have the opportunity to participate in video, photo and text-based  challenges,  like creating their own superheroes, coming up with lyrics for their personal anthems, making dance videos and creating posters for meaningful causes. One recent challenge involves designing their own  freak flags  to celebrate their eccentricity.   Maverick aims to provide girls and young women with ongoing opportunities to exercise their powers of creativity, curiosity, and daring in the years of their lives when they are still comfortable being messy, ambitious, and unapologetic,  Connors told HuffPost.  This is with the hope and expectation that they will become practiced and comfortable in experimenting and taking risks, in challenging the pressures of perfection, in being their real, powerful, authentic selves, and in working together \u2015 and that they will carry them forward into adulthood, and use them to make their own futures and change the world,  Connors added. The challenges come from  Catalysts,  or role models from a range of fields meant to inspire the young  Mavericks.  After sharing their work in response to challenges, users have the opportunity to view and reward each other\u2019s work with comments and badges for categories like  unique,   creative,   unstoppable  and  daring.  Chaffin and Connors develop the challenges in consultation with the role models themselves, as well as educators and  girl experts  to create experiences that are fun and thought-provoking, inspire creativity and experimentation, and encourage the young women to work together.  The two women met while working at the Walt Disney Company, where Chaffin led Disney Interactive\u2019s women and family division and Connors was editor-in-chief of Babble.  Though they bonded over their shared passion for empowering women and girls, Connors said the seeds for Maverick were actually planted some years before her time at Disney, when she was pursuing a career in academia.   My area was women and girls in social thought, with a particular focus on how they assert themselves \u2015 or rather, historically, how they\u2019re unable to assert themselves \u2015 in the public sphere. So I was very familiar with all of the research on what\u2019s sometimes called \u2018loss of voice\u2019 or the confidence gap \u2015 the phenomenon, around puberty and early adolescence, whereby girls go from being assertive and outspoken to not using their voices, not raising their hands, dropping out of sports, etc.,  Connors explained. Indeed, studies have highlighted the loss of confidence girls experience at surprisingly early ages and the importance of positive female role models in building their self-esteem. After Connors and Chaffin had both left Disney, they reconnected and decided to use their digital media experience to tackle this issue.  Girls and young women do feel extraordinary pressure to be perfect and likable and to follow the rules. Much of their current social media engagement increases that pressure,  said Connors.  Maverick\u2019s emphasis on creative messiness and authenticity allows girls to be able to push back against the myths of perfection - and to meaningfully exercise their very real powers.  In addition to research, the women also draw inspiration from Connors\u2019 12-year-old daughter Emilia.   She has always been intense and outspoken and driven and argumentative, and that\u2019s awesome. But I\u2019ve also found it really hard from a parenting perspective, in ways that have continually surprised me,  Connors told HuffPost.  I consider myself a really progressive, feminist parent, but I\u2019ve found myself, too often, imposing problematic social norms on my daughter ... Basically communicating to her that she should try to be more likable and polite and cooperative \u2015 a \u2018good girl,\u2019 who should conform to social approval \u2015 rather than letting her be the fully powerful person that she already is.  Connors and Chaffin see Maverick as pushing back against the kinds of norms and expectations that hinder girls\u2019 progress and suppress the ambition, energy and power they often exhibit at younger ages.  This goal has garnered broader support. Maverick has raised $2.7 million in seed funding from investors like LinkedIn CEO Jeff Weiner.  The company is also offering a live events platform with MaverickLIVE, a day of events across the country to connect young Mavericks and Catalysts and to celebrate girls on the platform and their achievements in areas like comedy, sports, music and  STEAM, a variation of STEM that incorporates the fields of art and design. The first MaverickLIVE event, which will take place in Los Angeles on April 28, will feature  Founding Mavericks  \u2015 peer role models like Laurie Hernandez, Chloe and Halle Bailey, Brooklyn and Bailey McKnight, Daunnette Reyome and Ruby Karp. Although the opportunity to connect and empower young women and girls is enticing, many parents are undoubtedly worried about social media networks and online privacy following the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

The shot, launched with just 1.5 seconds left on the clock, broke a tie in Game 5, giving the Cavs a 98-95 win and a 3-2 lead in the best-of-seven series.  In a huddle just before that shot, James told his teammates exactly what to do.  Just give me the ball,  he told them.  Give me the ball. They had a foul to give, so I wanted to go quick so they couldn\u2019t give up that foul, because we had no more timeouts. So I was able to turn and get to my spot.   Moments earlier, he helped save the game in another way with this block:  James finished with 44 points, 10 rebounds and 8 assists in 42 minutes.  The shot was reminiscent of a similar moment nearly a decade ago, when King James sank a three-point buzzer-beater in the 2009 playoffs against the Orlando Magic:  Pacers fans looking for a little consolation can note that the Magic came back to win that series.   Game 6 is on Friday night in Indiana.  "

      "text": "Two more women have come out against the boss of disgraced coach and convicted child molester Larry Nassar, alleging the man sexually assaulted them while performing practice medical exams, according to court filings from Tuesday. Police arrested former Michigan State University dean William Strampel in late March on two misdemeanor counts of willful neglect of duty, one count of misconduct of a public official and one count of fourth-degree criminal sexual misconduct after four women accused him of sexual misconduct. The latest allegations now bring the total number of women accusing him to six. Strampel reportedly lured the two young women into becoming models for practice examinations while he was the dean of MSU\u2019s College of Osteopathic Medicine, according to Tuesday filings from the Michigan Attorney General\u2019s Office obtained by CNN.   Strampel conducted a full examination, including a breast examination, an anal examination that included the penetration of the anus, a pelvic examination that penetrated the vagina, and all were conducted in front of a small group of medical students,  a complaint from the office stated. One of the women who participated accused Strampel of saying the examinations  turned him on  and that he was  beginning to get hard,  CNN reported. Another woman accused Strampel penetrating her vagina with his fingers before offering to admit her into medical school with a score of 19 on the MCAT, 6 points lower than MSU admissions benchmark for the standardized test. Strampel is already facing allegations from four women who accuse the former dean of groping multiple female students, as well as soliciting them for nude photos and sexual acts in exchange for favorable treatment, HuffPost reported in March. A hearing scheduled for May 3 will determine whether the new testimonies of the two women will be allowed in court for Strampel\u2019s trial, according to CNN. The Michigan Attorney General\u2019s Office did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.  MSU Interim President John Engler told HuffPost that  there will be no more Bill Strampels,  in response to the new allegations of abuse during practice exams.   What I continue to learn about Bill Strampel disgusts me,  Engler told HuffPost in a statement.  Anytime concerns are raised about faculty and staff behavior, we take those concerns seriously and investigate. We will not let our students and employees down. There is zero tolerance for abusive behavior and comments. We are making changes in our Human Resource policies, including those governing evaluations and reviews.    Strampel oversaw convicted sexual abuser Larry Nassar while at MSU and handled a 2014 Title IX investigation into sexual abuse accusations against the doctor. The dean allowed Nassar to continue working throughout the investigation, a time in which Nassar continued to abuse young athletes.  Investigators have found pornographic images and videos on Strampel\u2019s computer, which included one of Nassar sexually abusing a young female athlete.  Nassar abused at least 265 children and young women during his time as team doctor for MSU and USA Gymnastics. The Michigan Attorney General\u2019s Office launched an investigation into MSU after The Detroit News reported that over the course of two decades at least 14 school officials, including Strampel, were made aware of Nassar\u2019s actions.

A jury on Thursday found the veteran entertainer guilty on three felony counts \u2015 including penetration with lack of consent, penetration while unconscious and penetration after administering an intoxicant \u2015 at a retrial in Montgomery County court in Pennsylvania. Speaking to the press outside the courthouse in Norristown, attorney Gloria Allred, who represents 33 of Cosby\u2019s accusers, denounced the 80-year-old entertainer\u2019s legal team for trying to smear the victims\u2019 reputations after they testified against him.  You tried. You failed. The personal attacks did not work,  Allred said.  Bill Cosby, three words for you: Guilty, guilty, guilty.  After the verdict, three of the women who came forward, Victoria Valentina, Caroline Heldman and Lili Bernard, left the courtroom crying, celebrating the judgment with an emotional embrace. Andrea Constand, who accused Cosby of drugging and sexually assaulting her in the present case, did not speak publicly after the verdict, but she was seen holding friends and family as she exited the courtroom.  We are vindicated, we are validated and we are now part of the tsunami of women\u2019s power and justice,  Valentino, 73, said during a press conference with other accusers and Allred.  We are not shutting up and we are not going away,  Valentino added.  Get over it.  Valentino, a former Playboy playmate, says Cosby raped her in an apartment in the Hollywood Hills in 1969. Bernard, an actress who said Cosby drugged and raped her while she guest-starred on  The Cosby Show  in the early 1990s, also spoke after the trial, praising the Me Too movement.  I stand here in the spirit of Martin Luther King, who said that the arc of the moral universe is long, but today it has bent towards justice,  Bernard said.  Today, this jury has shown what the Me Too movement is saying: that women are worthy of being believed.  She added:  This is a victory not just for Andrea Constand, who I consider to be the Joan of Arc in the war on rape. It is not just a victory for the commonwealth [of Pennsylvania]. ... It is also a victory for womanhood and it is a victory for all sexual assault survivors \u2015 female and male.  In a statement, Janice Baker-Kinney, a former bartender who said Cosby drugged her after inviting her to a house party in Reno, Nevada, said in a statement that she feels she can now move on from her assault. The  years of this toxic chain of silence has been broken and we can now move forward with our heads held high as survivors and not victims,  Baker-Kinney wrote.  This may be the end for Mr. Cosby, but this victory is just the beginning for many of us, to fight for justice, to do the right thing and support every person who has ever been shamed and humiliated and blamed.   May this verdict open the floodgates to those who have been hiding their shame for far too long,  she added. "

A statue of British suffragist and feminist icon Millicent Fawcett was unveiled in the northwest area of London on Tuesday alongside 11 other statues of historic male figures. The bronze statue portrays a 50-year-old Fawcett (around the age she became the leader of the National Union of Women\u2019s Suffrage Societies) with her hair pulled back, wearing an unassuming dress and holding a banner that reads,  Courage calls to courage everywhere.    I wanted her to be standing there not at all sexualized, but statesmanlike,  Caroline Criado-Perez, the freelance writer who created the petition last year to erect a statue in Fawcett\u2019s honor, told The New York Times.  Fawcett is the first statue of a woman and the first statue designed by a woman in the city\u2019s historic Parliament Square. The iconic women\u2019s rights activist joins the company of statues that include former British Prime Ministers Winston Churchill and David Lloyd George, alongside other international figures like Abraham Lincoln and Mahatma Gandhi.   When you think of the great people in Parliament Square, and when you realize that not one of them is a woman, it sort of begs the question, are we saying there haven\u2019t been incredible women in the past? That our country hasn\u2019t been built on the back of great women?  London Mayor Sadiq Khan said before the unveiling ceremony.  Hundreds of people gathered in Parliament Square Tuesday to witness the unveiling of the statues, the BBC reported.  Born in 1847, Fawcett was part of the first wave of feminist thinkers who pushed for women get the right to vote. She identified as a suffragist instead of a  suffragette,  a historically more well-known title but one used to identify a later wave of more militant women\u2019s advocates. Fawcett was radical in her ideology but favored non-violent protest. In 1897, she created the National Union of Women\u2019s Suffrage Societies. She died in 1929, a year after women won the right to vote in the United Kingdom.  During the unveiling ceremony, British Prime Minister Theresa May applauded Fawcett and her tireless work that changed the course of the country\u2019s history.  I would not be standing here today as prime minister,  May said,  no female MPs would have taken their seats in Parliament, none of us would have had the rights and protections we now enjoy, were it not for one truly great woman: Dame Millicent Garrett Fawcett.

Actress Lili Bernard said Cosby drugged and raped her in the early 1990s while she was guest-starring on the final season of  The Cosby Show.  It\u2019s a story many other women echoed, and today their pain was validated after a jury found Cosby, 80, guilty of drugging and sexually assaulting former college women\u2019s basketball coach Andrea Constand in 2004. After the guilty verdict was read, audible gasps could be heard in the courtroom. Bernard and her friend Caroline Heldman left the room and collapsed onto a railing, Bernard sobbing as Heldman embraced her. Longtime Cosby accuser Victoria Valentino was also seen in tears embracing Heldman.  Bernard said Thursday\u2019s verdict has restored her faith in humanity.  It is a victory for womanhood,  Bernard said at a press conference shortly after the verdict.  It is a victory for all sexual assault survivors, female and male.  Lawyer Gloria Allred, who is representing the Cosby accusers, said  justice has been done.   Finally, we can say women are believed, not only on hashtag \u2018Me Too\u2019 but in a court of law,  Allred said.

Colleges, I beg you to have character, stand up for what\u2019s right and set the standard for abusers and how campuses support survivors,  the Olympic gymnast wrote on her Instagram on Monday evening.  Please create safer environments so students feel comfortable sharing their stories and take better measures to PREVENT abuse.   Raisman has been visiting college campuses to promote her new book Fierce and discuss her experience as a sexual assault survivor. She wrote that she was appalled by how many people told her they\u2019d been sexually assaulted \u2015 and by how little universities seem to care about the well-being of students.   It hurts me to hear so many students tell me their stories in tears, some for the first time, of how they were assaulted on campus,  Raisman wrote.  Many come to me because they don\u2019t know what else to do. They\u2019re traumatized from their horrible experience and also devastated and scared that their abuser is STILL walking around campus.  Raisman has become a leading voice for sexual assault survivors after publicly accusing now-imprisoned former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar of sexually abusing her for years under the guise of treatment. She has come for USA Gymnastics, the U.S. Olympic Committee, Michigan State University and people in power who enabled Nassar\u2019s predatory behavior.   To all the colleges out there, DO BETTER. Who cares if someone is a starting player, star athlete, exceptional student? If someone is an abuser, there must be consequences,  Raisman continued in her Instagram post.  Putting reputations above safety needs to stop.  College-aged women are at a higher risk of being sexually assaulted than any other age group, according to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network. One in five women and one in 16 men are sexually assaulted while at college, and more than 90 percent of those assaults go unreported, the National Sexual Violence Resource Center reports. All too often, colleges fail to disclose sex crimes in order to protect their reputation.  Raisman summed up her point with a powerful challenge:  Do the right thing and have character. Which college will be the leader in helping prevent abuse and supporting survivors?   "

Bryant helped write the teleplay with producer Ali Rushfield and West herself.  SNL  creator Lorne Michaels\u2019 Broadway Video Entertainment company will help develop the production, with Andrew Singer as executive producer. Other executive producers include Elizabeth Banks, who originally optioned West\u2019s memoir for TV in 2016, and Max Handelman\u2019s Brownstone Productions. Hulu described the production to The Hollywood Reporter as  the story of a fat young woman who wants to change her life, but not her body.   Bryant and West\u2019s supporters on social media are already buzzing about the news:   Bryant recently told New York magazine\u2019s The Cut that she\u2019s extremely selective about the projects she participates in, so her starring role in West\u2019s memoir adaptation is notable.  I turn down so many things, because so often movie stuff that I get sent is demeaning in some way,  Bryant said in the interview.

      "text": "The proposals were practically perfect.  The settings were lavish. Flowers were artfully styled. Friends and family were present. The diamond rings were sparkly and large. Chiseled men got down on one knee to propose to beautiful, tall, blond, white women.  In most TV series, these would be the ultimate happy endings for the female characters. Maybe their relationships would fall apart down the road, but in that moment, they would obviously say yes to the proposals \u2015 most likely with teary eyes and expressions of joy only the knowledge that they now (perhaps?) wouldn\u2019t die alone could bring.  But in the most recent seasons of  UnREAL  and  Jessica Jones,  the former of which wrapped up on Monday night, these familiar setups didn\u2019t amount to familiar conclusions. Both aforementioned women turned down their respective proposals, staying single by choice.  On  Jessica Jones,  Jessica\u2019s best friend Trish, an actress-turned-broadcaster-turned-wannabe-vigilante-sidekick, rejects her successful, empathetic and loving broadcast journalist boyfriend.  I don\u2019t want to be with Griffin,  she explains.  I want to be him. I want to do what he does. And that\u2019s not love, and that\u2019s not fair to either one of us.   On  UnREAL,  things get meta. The rejected proposals happen within  Everlasting,  the  Bachelor(ette) -like show that the main characters produce. Serena Wolcott is the reality show\u2019s first female lead, a whip-smart single woman who proves difficult to manipulate. On a show that usually depends on a happy ending for ratings and audience buy-in, Serena chooses no one.  I have wanted this so much, but I realize that I have to wait until I know for sure in my soul that I have found my perfect match,  she says to her two dejected suitors \u2015 and all of America. What might seem like lines plucked straight from the  How To Be a Strong Female Character  guidebook becomes something else in the hands of the  UnREAL  and  Jessica Jones  cast and crew: A rare glimpse at what a Realistic Single Female Character looks like in 2018 (though both series certainly have their pitfalls). They join an increasingly varied and lengthy list of TV shows that are subverting the idea that for women, all narrative roads lead toward and end with coupledom.  Unmarried women are a potent force in American society. As of 2016, there were 110.6 million unmarried people over the age of 18 in the United States, and 53.2 percent of those people were women. As Rebecca Traister wrote in an adapted excerpt of her 2016 book All the Single Ladies,  We are living through the invention of independent female adulthood as a norm, not an aberration, and the creation of an entirely new population: adult women who are no longer economically, socially, sexually, or reproductively dependent on or defined by the men they marry.   And yet single women are still being explicitly and implicitly told \u2015 by politicians, by pop culture creators, by the wedding industry \u2015 that their lives are fundamentally incomplete. They are constantly in a state of  becoming,  not because of personal growth and possibility, but because of what they lack \u2015 a long-term, monogamous, romantic (implied male) partner. In the words of Simone de Beauvoir:  Marriage is traditionally the destiny offered to women by society. Most women are married or have been, or plan to be or suffer from not being.   In 1960, nearly 60 percent of Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 were married. By 2011, that percentage had dropped to 20 \u2015 a record low. So what happens when, for the first time in American history, you have a critical mass of unmarried women over the age of 30 who choose to or simply find themselves in a position to build family structures, financially stable careers and homes independently? Do the stories \u2015 even the fictional ones \u2015 we tell about these women expand along with their realities? Or do we continue to privilege romantic partnership as the natural, and only truly happy, end to a female character\u2019s narrative arc?  After all, even Carrie Bradshaw, Liz Lemon and Leslie Knope ended up tying the knot. On the small screen at least, we\u2019re seeing a resurgence of complicated narratives about unmarried women. Shows like  UnREAL,   Jessica Jones,   Being Mary Jane,   The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel  and the upcoming  Dietland  are pushing the boundaries of what single womanhood looks like, spotlighting complex, wildly different stories about women who just happen to be unattached \u2015 and might not be immediately compelled to become otherwise. In  Jessica Jones,  not only is Trish unmarried, but so is the titular character herself, and, in Season 2, high-powered attorney Jeri Hogarth. Romantic and sexual relationships certainly feature in the show, but the Marvel series is ultimately about self-discovery \u2015 Jessica\u2019s embrace of her superhero status, or Trish\u2019s realization that her deepest desires are professional and not romantic. In  UnREAL,  producers Rachel Goldberg and Quinn King are both single, as is the aforementioned protagonist of  Everlasting,  Serena. The show-within-the-show might be laser-focused on manufactured love, but  UnREAL  itself is more interested in power \u2015 how it\u2019s wielded, how it corrupts, how women can reclaim it. For both series, romance is part of the equation, but it\u2019s hardly the only or even primary goal for their female protagonists, a reality that has long been accepted as the norm for male characters. In 2018, the  behavioral latitude for women is so much wider than it used to be,  film critic and author Molly Haskell told HuffPost.  It\u2019s just a real existentialist adventure for women now.   Of course, we\u2019ve seen boundary-breaking, unmarried protagonists on television before. Shows like  That Girl,  (1966-71),  The Mary Tyler Moore Show  (1970-77),  Murphy Brown  (1988-98) and  Living Single  (1993-98) centered on single women without condescension and without assuming that romance was the only project they were willing to tackle. And by doing so, they increased audiences\u2019 collective imaginations of what a single woman\u2019s life could be. (Still, some perceived these characters as threatening to the real-world status quo, like when Vice President Dan Quayle called out Murphy Brown for  mocking the importance of fathers by bearing a child alone and calling it just another lifestyle choice. ) When  Sex and the City  \u2015 another show that centered single women, but with an intentional focus on their love and sex lives \u2015 premiered in 1998, it contained a radical premise: That single women in their 30s were interesting, fabulous and could lead fulfilled lives full of great (and not so great) sex. Before the finale aired in January 2004, there was much discussion about how the series would end. As Emily Nussbaum wrote on Slate in 2002,  SATC  raised a heady question:  What, in a single woman\u2019s life, counts as a happy ending?  (For its part, the show went an emotionally satisfying but traditional route, leaving all of its lead characters in stable partnerships, though not necessarily marriages, by the series\u2019 end.) The finale of  UnREAL\u2019s  third season asks similar questions. What does a happy ending look like for a 30-something woman who runs her own company in Silicon Valley, has model looks and still finds herself dealing with men who lack the qualities she needs in a partner? What does a happy ending look like for a 30-something woman who is brilliant at her job and dependent on her equally brilliant boss, but suspects her chosen career path might be eating away at her soul? What does a happy ending look like for a woman in her early 40s who is building the empire she always dreamed about and still wants more? These questions alone make for fascinating television. For  UnREAL  co-creator Sarah Gertrude Shapiro, exploring those questions meant creating space for women  to see reflections of themselves on TV that feel layered and not stereotypical.    I think it\u2019s important to come up with different tropes and avatars that show us a different way to look at ourselves,  she said.  And also to show us being valuable \u2015 like, incredibly valuable \u2015 and not only valuable, but fulfilled.  Faced with this Very Big Goal,  UnREAL  notably resists making simplistic feminist statements for the sake of making feminist statements. In the world of the show, Serena\u2019s televised decision to stay single leads to headlines like  Beware The Princess Fantasy  and  Don\u2019t Settle, Says Serena,  while Twitter users hail Serena as a  feminist hero.  Rachel is self-satisfied and celebratory.  You\u2019ve inspired women everywhere not to settle,  she tells Serena.   That\u2019s not what this is, Rachel,  Serena says, wryly.  You produced me to pick neither guy. So what, I\u2019d end up like you \u2015 empty, alone?   No, I produced an empowered, feminist statement about not being so desperate to pair up that you overlook a mountain of flaws just so you can be done,  counters Rachel. But Serena is too astute for that.  Tell the truth, Rachel. You don\u2019t hate it here. You love it,  she says.  This is exactly where you belong. Oh, by the way, I made my choice for me, not you. I know it must kill you, but I feel great.   Moments later, we see Serena in the back of her town car. She takes out her cell phone, opens a Tinder-like app, and starts swiping, again and again and again. She\u2019s already exhausted. I found myself crying watching her, not because her decision felt tragic, but because it felt authentic. Being single, even when you are satisfied with and excited by your life, does not preclude a desire for a romantic relationship that fits. Single women aren\u2019t avatars for a feminist project \u2015 we\u2019re human beings. And sometimes, a Realistic Female Character is more interesting and more narratively important than a Strong Female Character. In fact, tragedy in both  UnREAL  and  Jessica Jones  is defined not by the end of romantic connection, but in the severing of female bonds and partnerships (Rachel and Quinn\u2019s, Rachel and Serena\u2019s, Jessica and Trish\u2019s). In contrast, triumph on these shows lies in self-discovery, a woman\u2019s reclamation of her future and its ever-expansive opportunities. Those futures might include romance, if the right opportunity arises or if it\u2019s something a given character truly desires. (A future between Quinn and her former flame Chet is teased at the end of  UnREAL,  and the last moments of the  Jessica Jones  finale show Jessica finding solace in dinner with her sexy neighbor and his son.) However, long-term romantic partnership is not a narrative given, and it\u2019s certainly not the only possible happy, or even emotionally satisfying, ending these female characters have before them.   The final moments of the  UnReal  finale find Rachel alone. She\u2019s parted ways with Quinn, her boss and intellectual equal \u2015  You are a dark twisted wreck, Rachel Goldberg. And I am going to miss every piece of it,  says Quinn, in what might be the single most romantic moment of the series \u2015 to buy the cabin in Oregon she\u2019s been quietly pining over all season. She walks around its empty rooms and out onto the porch. A small smile creeps onto her face as she looks out into the mass of greenery and empty space in front of her. She lays down on the porch, arms splayed, looking up at the sky and just breathes. The future is a question mark \u2015 one we will get to see play out, as the show has already filmed its fourth season \u2015 but she owns it. As Traister put it,  Single female life is not prescription, but its opposite: liberation.  That lack of structure is equal parts terrifying and exhilarating. Perhaps in a single woman\u2019s life, off-screen as well as on, a  happy  ending is no ending at all. "

I was in the car driving back to the hotel. And I even said out loud that last night Larry was fingering me,  Maroney, 22, told NBC  Today  co-host Savannah Guthrie in a Sunday night segment of  Dateline.  Maroney said she reported the abuse while she and her teammates were at the gymnastics world championships in Tokyo. Geddert and a few of Maroney\u2019s teammates, including gymnast and Nassar abuse survivor Aly Raisman, were in the car the night she spoke up. Maroney, who was 15 at the time, said Geddert didn\u2019t say anything in response, while others in the car  gasped  loudly. Raisman told  Dateline  that Maroney  basically described in graphic detail what Nassar had done to her the night before.  Two other people in the car that night corroborated Maroney\u2019s story to  Dateline.  Geddert worked in the gymnastics world for decades before he was suspended by USA Gymnastics in January in light of the allegations against Nassar, with whom the coach was reportedly very close. Geddert quickly resigned after being suspended and is under criminal investigation.   That was the moment that I shut it down,  Maroney said of Geddert allegedly not responding to her cry for help.  In my head, I was never gonna speak about [Nassar] again. And I was just gonna go along with it.  Geddert did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. Watch a clip of the  Dateline  interview below. Nassar, who also served as a doctor at Michigan State University, has been accused of sexually abusing over 260 young athletes. Over the last year, he pleaded guilty to several counts of sexual assault of minors and possessing child pornography and is serving three concurrent prison sentences of up to 175 years.   For the first time, to me, [it] was very, very hard for me to not acknowledge the fact that this was something \u2015 this was not treatment. I was being abused,  Maroney said.  I remember waking up the next day and wanting to tell someone.  "

The award, given to Kaepernick in an Amsterdam ceremony, is handed out each year to  individuals and groups who speak out for justice,  Amnesty says on its website, with an aim to  create debate, encourage public action and raise awareness of human rights issues.  Past recipients include Nelson Mandela, Malala Yousafzai and U2.  Kaepernick famously caused a stir by taking a knee during the national anthem at NFL games to protest racial inequality, and by refusing to stop. Other players later joined his protests. No team has picked him up after he became a free agent after the 2016 season \u2015 although an Adidas executive recently said the company is interested in sponsoring Kaepernick if he is signed. A large number of NFL managers reportedly  generally hate  Kaepernick for his activism, and he publicly earned the scorn of President Donald Trump. Kaepernick operates a charity, the Colin Kaepernick Foundation, which marked a milestone in January when it finished donating $1 million to organizations that help underprivileged communities \u2015 a pledge he made in 2016.   The Ambassador of Conscience award celebrates the spirit of activism and exceptional courage, as embodied by Colin Kaepernick. He is an athlete who is now widely recognized for his activism because of his refusal to ignore or accept racial discrimination,  Salil Shetty, secretary general of Amnesty International, said in a statement. In a speech at the award ceremony, Kaepernick touched on the death of Tamir Rice, the 12-year-old shot by police in Ohio, along with what motivates him and other social activists.  We protest because we love ourselves and our people,  he said. He echoed the sentiments in a statement issued by Amnesty:  While taking a knee is a physical display that challenges the merits of who is excluded from the notion of freedom, liberty, and justice for all, the protest is also rooted in a convergence of my moralistic beliefs, and my love for the people.

      "text": "(Reuters) - Former cycling champion Lance Armstrong on Thursday agreed to pay $5 million to settle a federal suit claiming he defrauded his sponsor, the U.S. Postal Service, by using performance-enhancing drugs, his attorney and federal officials said. The settlement ends the long-running false claims suit brought by fellow cyclist Floyd Landis and joined by the U.S. government, which had sought $100 million in damages on behalf of the Post Office, according to statements from Armstrong\u2019s attorney, Elliot Peters, and the U.S. Department of Justice.  No one is above the law,  Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Division Chad Readler said in a statement.  This settlement demonstrates that those who cheat the government will be held accountable.  By phone, Peters told Reuters that he thinks the Postal Service realized it could not prove damages to it caused by Armstrong\u2019s behavior. He said the settlement was reached ahead of a scheduled May 7 trial date. Armstrong, who is now 46 and lives in Austin, Texas, won the biggest race in professional cycling, the Tour de France, a record seven times, six of them while riding for the Postal Service team. He was stripped of his titles and banned for life from the sport in 2012 by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency after it accused him in a report of engineering one of the most sophisticated doping schemes in sports. Armstrong admitted to the cheating in a January 2013 televised interview with Oprah Winfrey. This is the last legal matter related to Armstrong\u2019s doping, Peters said.  I\u2019m looking forward to devoting myself to the many great things in my life \u2015 my five kids, my wife, my podcast, several exciting writing and film projects, my work as a cancer survivor, and my passion for sports and competition,  Armstrong said in a statement provided by Peters. The settlement also calls for Armstrong to pay $1.65 million for the court costs of his former teammate Landis, who also used performance-enhancing drugs and who was stripped of his 2006 Tour de France championship. Landis originally brought the lawsuit in 2010 under a federal law, the False Claims Act, that lets whistle-blowers pursue fraud cases on behalf of the government, and obtain rewards if successful. Landis will receive $1.1 million as his share of the settlement. The Justice Department joined the case in February 2013 after Amstrong\u2019s public confession. "

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D), in partnership with State Street Global Advisors, the management group that commissioned the statue, announced on Thursday that Fearless Girl will moved from its current location by the Bowling Green park to face the New York Stock Exchange. The move is due to safety concerns and pedestrian traffic, The New York Times reports.    We are proud to be home to the Fearless Girl. She is a potent symbol of the need for change at the highest levels of corporate America \u2015 and she will become a durable part of our city\u2019s civic life,  de Blasio said.  This move to a new location will ensure that her message and impact will continue to be heard, as well as improve access for visitors.  Fearless Girl, a bronze work sculpted by Kristen Visbal, stands in a narrow spot in a corner of Bowling Green. According to city officials, this creates a safety hazard due to the large number of tourists visiting the spot every day. Other officials expressed concerns that the mix of Fearless Girl, Charging Bull and the volume of pedestrians could attract an attack similar to last year\u2019s in lower Manhattan, when a driver killed eight people.   I am thrilled Fearless Girl will remain in New York, inspiring global collaboration between genders for better decisions, and an improved environment at every strata of society,  Visbal said in a statement. De Blasio\u2019s press secretary, Eric Phillips, said that Charging Bull \u2015 a 1989 work by Arturo Di Modica \u2015 will  almost certainly  be moved with Fearless Girl, although there\u2019s no exact timeline.  Fearless Girl was erected in March 2017. Ron O\u2019Hanley, State Street\u2019s CEO, described the work as a call for companies to  increase gender diversity on their boards  and celebrate women leaders in business. However, in October, the Department of Labor alleged that State Street had paid women and black executives less than their white male counterparts. State Street disputed the Labor Department\u2019s findings but agreed to pay a $5 million settlement over the claims. Critics have accused Fearless Girl of being an empty symbol and an avatar of capitalism rather than of justice, but it\u2019s been a hit with many people and has kicked off conversations about female empowerment in different workspaces.    I\u2019m thrilled that the Fearless Girl will have a long-term home in the heart of New York\u2019s financial district,  Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) said in a statement this week.  The Fearless Girl called attention to the severe lack of women sitting on corporate boards but she connected with so many women and girls because [she] embodies the resiliency that each woman must possess to get ahead.

      "text": "Martha and Bela Karolyi of the infamous Karolyi Ranch, an elite gymnastics training center that\u2019s sent dozens of athletes to the Olympics, have finally broken their silence about former USA Gymnastics team doctor and convicted child molester Larry Nassar.  The two sat down with NBC  Today  co-host Savannah Guthrie for a  Dateline  segment set to air this Sunday. Several gymnasts claimed that Nassar, who\u2019s been accused of sexually abusing over 260 young athletes under the guise of medical treatment, abused them at the Karolyi Ranch in Hunstville, Texas.   Any child who was violated by Nassar, it\u2019s a crime and it\u2019s so sad,  Martha Karolyi said, adding that it\u2019s simply  awful.  This is the first time the couple is speaking out since USA Gymnastics cut ties with the training facility in January. The Karolyi Ranch served as USA Gymnastics\u2019 national team training center since 2001, and was the home for many elite American gymnasts including Aly Raisman, Maggie Nichols and Simone Biles. All three gymnasts, and several others, say Nassar sexually abused them at the training center.    I heard during the testimonies that some of the parents were in the therapy room with their own child and Larry Nassar was performing this, and the parent couldn\u2019t see,  Martha Karolyi said.  How I could see?   Some parents did testify during Nassar\u2019s sentencing hearings that they were in the room while the now-disgraced doctor abused their child. Nassar would often position himself in between the parent and child while he sexually abused them. Many also pointed to the institutional giants Nassar worked for, including USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University, as the reason many parents blindly trusted him.  Bela Karolyi added his thoughts during the short segment, telling Guthrie:  The whole thing is just like an explosion, a bomb exploding. Boom.   While it\u2019s still unclear whether the Karolyis knew of Nassar\u2019s abuse, dozens of athletes allege other forms of abuse took place at the ranch including verbal and emotional abuse, and limiting food intake of athletes during arduous training sessions.  National gymnastics champion and Nassar survivor Mattie Larson explained in her January victim impact statement how the isolation of the Karoyli Ranch fostered a culture that enabled a predator like Nassar.   The complete detachment from the outside world, on top of careless and neglectful adults, made the ranch the perfect environment for abusers and molesters to thrive,  Larson said.  She later called out Martha:  Martha, did you keep Larry around because he was a good doctor? Or did you really keep him around because he let us compete when we were injured and was willing to keep your secrets?   Larson described the grueling seven-hour practices six days a week that she and her teammates endured at the ranch, saying she spiraled into a deep depression and a  destructive  eating disorder at 15. She dreaded going back so much that she one time deliberately hurt herself to avoid going back to the training facility.  "

      "text": "We seem to have reached a new moment in the Me Too movement, judging by several recent stories pondering whether famous men accused of sexual misconduct are ready to re-enter the public eye.  In a Hollywood Reporter article this week, comedians and comedy club owners discussed the prospects of a career comeback for Louis C.K., who allegedly masturbated in front of several female comedians. The article asserted that reviving his career was somehow a foregone conclusion. But no quote has ever been proven false more often than F. Scott Fitzgerald\u2019s declaration that there are no second acts [in] American lives, so the question is not really whether C.K. will eventually come back but when, where and how. People close to chef and restaurateur Mario Batali \u2014 who attached a recipe for cinnamon rolls to an apology for his alleged sexual misconduct \u2014 told The New York Times earlier this month that he  is floating ideas, pondering timelines and examining whether there is a way for him to step back into his career, at least in some fashion.  When Mr. Batali\u2019s name comes up among groups of food professionals over drinks or between sessions at conferences, some say that if any of the men caught in the current wave of sexual harassment scandals can forge a path back, it might be Mr. Batali. Vanity Fair noted this week a tidbit buried in a New York Post Page Six story on how former  Today  show anchor Matt Lauer \u2015 who reportedly exposed himself in front of a colleague and installed a secret button to automatically lock his office door to provide privacy for harassment \u2015 is  testing the waters for a public comeback by coming out of hiding from his Hamptons home.    With his marriage to Annette Roque now over, he\u2019s ready to restart his life, pals say,  the tabloid reported. The show  Entertainment Tonight  reported that Lauer  definitely regrets his behavior  and remains hopeful of a comeback. These stories, which often feature unnamed friends and confidants describing the alleged sexual harassers in sympathetic terms,  are to be expected  as a product of male privilege, said Elizabeth Velez, professor of women\u2019s and gender studies at Georgetown University.  They\u2019re typical of male entitlement, of men \u2014 particularly wealthy, powerful men \u2014 who say, \u2018OK, I\u2019ve suffered enough. That\u2019s enough. I did what I did, and I\u2019m really sorry, and I went for treatment, and now it\u2019s time for me to do the work that I was doing,\u2019  Velez told HuffPost.  It\u2019s typical patriarchy at work.  Noreen Farrell, the executive director of Equal Rights Advocates, a legal organization that focuses on gender equality, similarly attributed the speculation over potential career comebacks to the existing  psyche and bias that keep harassers in positions of power.  A related genre of stories concerns the whereabouts of alleged sexual harassers, like a Hollywood Reporter profile of Charlie Rose last week, with sources describing the former TV host as  broken,   brilliant  and  lonely.  (The story also details how he  decamped to his four-bedroom, 5,500-square-foot Long Island home,  which includes  panoramic views of the water and Fire Island in the distance. ) Farrell characterized these anecdotes and  redemption stories  as  potentially dangerous to the progress of the Me Too movement  and  a distraction.  They deflect attention from accusers \u2015 whose lives and careers their harassers have deeply harmed \u2015 as well as from the larger institutional and systemic problems exposed by Me Too, she said.  It\u2019s about this narrative of second chances, at a moment when we should be thinking about how to help women have recovery and second chances after harassment, and I think it trivializes the harm perpetrated by these men,  Farrell said. In so many of the harassment cases that have come to light, the victims\u2019 experiences have forced them out of industries and denied them chances for career comebacks or advancement \u2014 the very opportunities that these men are now afforded.  A lot of the people who are saying, \u2018When can these people come back?\u2019... they really haven\u2019t thought through the damage, the damage to women who can\u2019t do that work, the women who have been excluded,  Velez said.  For them, there are ways in which this stopped their careers, and we\u2019re not talking about what do we do to get these women back in it.  Farrell argued that these  redemption stories  are not worth considering.  I\u2019ve had people say, \u2018Well, shouldn\u2019t people get second chances?\u2019 I don\u2019t really care,  she said.  I guess everyone moves on, and hopefully you learn from what happened. But there are also consequences, and sometimes we should focus on consequences and not on how they\u2019re going to bounce back from an accusation.  Velez suggested that at some point, the men could contemplate returning to the public eye. But she was adamant that  it\u2019s too soon,  and said it\u2019s unclear when that time could be. She also said the men should show that they will  support the women that they have harmed  and have taken responsibility for their actions beyond just apologies, such as some form of  reparations.  In a story about  second chances,  several experts told The Associated Press this week that perpetrators should attempt to seek forgiveness and make amends. Velez argued that this kind of reckoning should happen in a more public way. Noting news reports that have mentioned some of the alleged sexual harassers undergoing therapy or  self-reflection,  she said they could demonstrate their efforts to confront their behavior by publicly discussing what they\u2019ve learned.  If they want to come back publicly, sorry, you have to deal with this publicly. You can\u2019t just say, \u2018OK, I went to therapy for six months, and I get it,\u2019  she said.  I want to know about their sense of entitlement, why they think [sexual harassment] was something they could do, and what they\u2019ve come to now.  Ultimately, the onus may be on women to  really control the conversation  and move it forward, Velez said. She also expressed concern that  some of the outrage  from the Me Too movement  has sort of subsided.  Farrell said that the spate of  redemption stories  present a new challenge for the movement: making sure that the focus remains on helping survivors of sexual violence.  Look, the harassers have gotten enough attention, and we need to be concerned more with survivors,  she said.  I do think that there are people in this country who identify with people who are harassers and are rooting for them to be able to have comebacks, and I think our job in the movement is to make sure people are identifying with people who are survivors.

      "text": "The first time USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar examined Olympic gymnast McKayla Maroney, she said, he sexually abused her.  Maroney, in her first interview since she went public with allegations against Nassar in October, said he abused her  every time  she saw him after that initial experience \u2015  hundreds  of times.  He said that nobody would understand this and the sacrifice that it takes to get to the Olympics so \u2018You can\u2019t tell people this,\u2019  Maroney told NBC  Today  co-host Savannah Guthrie for a  Dateline  report set to air on Sunday.  He didn\u2019t say it in a way that was like mean or anything like that. I actually was like, \u2018That makes sense, I don\u2019t want to tell anybody about this.\u2019 I didn\u2019t believe that they would understand.  Nassar, who also was Michigan State University team doctor, has been accused of sexually abusing over 260 young athletes under the guise of medical treatment. He\u2019s now serving three concurrent prison sentences of up to 175 years for sexual assault and child pornography. Maroney told Guthrie that Nassar groomed her by bringing her food \u2015 a show of affection in a sport that consistently starves its athletes.   I would\u2019ve starved at the Olympics if I didn\u2019t have him bring me food,  Maroney said, adding that Nassar bought her a loaf of bread.  Your coaches are just always watching you and wanting to keep you skinny. There\u2019s just other things about the culture that are also messed up that he used against us.  Maroney signed a confidentiality settlement with USA Gymnastics in December 2016 barring her from sharing her story. The organization said in January it wouldn\u2019t seek to punish Maroney if she chose to break the agreement.  During a luncheon on Tuesday for the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children in New York City, Maroney said it seemed as though all USA Gymnastics  cared about is money and medals.    I wasn\u2019t listened to, cared about or believed, and all of those things need to be weeded out of society because that\u2019s where things went wrong,  she said at the event.   Neither Michigan State University nor USA Gymnastics immediately responded to HuffPost\u2019s requests for comment on Maroney\u2019s remarks.  Other Nassar survivors, including Maroney\u2019s Olympic teammate Jordyn Wieber, and Olympic athletes from other sports, testified before a U.S. Senate committee on Wednesday, encouraging lawmakers to help combat sexual abuse in amateur sports. The same day, seven women filed lawsuits against MSU, USA Gymnastics and the U.S. Olympic Committee, alleging Nassar abused them.  "

      "text": "The Securities and Exchange Commission has waded into the debate over what investors can do to stop fossil fuel companies from destroying the Earth\u2019s habitable climate. And in siding with a major oil company, the agency inadvertently strengthened the case for divesting from fossil fuels altogether.  Late last year, Trillium Asset Management, an investment firm that works with environmental groups but also has fossil fuel investments, proposed a shareholder resolution calling for EOG Resources, one of the largest oil producers in the country, to set a target for cutting greenhouse gas emissions. But before shareholders could vote on the proposal, EOG complained to the SEC, requesting approval to ignore the proposal, which it said would  micromanage  the company with a  rigid and time-bound  target.  In February, the SEC agreed with EOG\u2019s concerns, stating shareholders  would not be in a position to make an informed judgment  on the  matters of a complex nature  on which the resolutions sought to act. Last month, the SEC sent a formal letter to Trillium rejecting the proposal, allowing EOG to ignore the resolution and block a vote. Axios\u2019 Amy Harder, who drew national attention to the case earlier this month, called the move  unprecedented,  leaving investors  stunned.   The ruling is a major setback for advocates who say internal shareholder pressure from high-minded investors is the best way to reduce pollution by corporate giants. It also adds new weight to arguments calling for more severe government intervention in the energy industry, either by nationalizing utilities and fossil fuel producers or imposing steep levies on emissions and extractive industries. But with Republicans in control of all three branches of the federal government and Democrats largely wrestling over whether to embrace more leftist economic principles, neither of these prospects is likely to happen in the near future.  So, at least in the short term, the SEC decision strengthens the case that the only serious strategy for investors to pressure fossil fuel companies is to completely pull their money out. In the year leading up to last February, shareholders filed 429 resolutions, 83 focused on climate change, according to an annual report tracking such proposals. Of that 83 figure, which represents 20 percent of all proposals, 27 resolutions called for carbon risk disclosures and another 27 demanded that companies set deadlines for reducing emissions.  Such proposals, even when enacted, do little to incentivize companies to change polluting business practices while providing a veneer of progressive action. Take, for example, Exxon Mobil Corp. The oil giant caved to shareholder pressure last year to thoroughly account for its climate change risks and, in February, issued its first report. But, in a brazen move, the report claimed there is nearly no risk to Exxon Mobil\u2019s business.  In March, Occidental Petroleum, one of the largest oil producers in Texas, responded to shareholders\u2019 climate concerns with its own report, finding, curiously, that the company\u2019s business won\u2019t be impacted by global warming or policies to reduce the emissions causing it.  The existence of the reports represents the start of slow change at these companies, said Danielle Fugere, president of the nonprofit As You Sow, which tracks shareholder proxy fights. Even if the reports are tailored to bolster companies\u2019 profit outlook, she said they provide information to investors that can ultimately strengthen the case for divestment.  Even when a company doesn\u2019t necessarily give you the response you want, their response gives you information, and that\u2019s the real goal,  she told HuffPost.  Obviously the oil and gas companies haven\u2019t changed what they do, but from an investor perspective, even getting them to think about how they can transition is good.   But that sort of patient approach to shifting away from fossil fuels conflicts with the increasingly dire warnings from climate scientists who say the world economy requires an urgent transformation to avoid planetary catastrophe. Small, incremental fixes in the form of market solutions and corporate reformism represent what The Intercept\u2019s Kate Aronoff described as  denial by a different name.    Shareholder resolutions and shareholder activism pushing fossil fuel companies to change has to take into account what we are really asking for: We need to see real decarbonization plans,  Ben Cushing, who helps lead the Sierra Club\u2019s Beyond Dirty Fuels campaign, told HuffPost.  That really gets at the core of the fossil fuel industry\u2019s business model.   The divestment movement gained significant momentum this year after New York City announced plans in January to pull roughly $5 billion in pension fund investments out of oil, gas and coal companies and sue oil companies for climate change-related damages, a move quickly followed by other cities. European capitals including Berlin, Stockholm and Paris made similar divestments in 2016.   Since companies weren\u2019t being responsive to shareholders anyway \u2015 witness Exxon\u2019s recent absurd declaration that it faced no real climate risk \u2015 it may save everyone the trouble of pretending that they\u2019ll someday actually engage,  Bill McKibben, the founder of 350.org, told HuffPost.  It further strengthens the already overwhelming argument for divestment, and makes politicians like Bill de Blasio and Scott Stringer look prescient for the announcement earlier this year that New York City was done playing around with these guys.   Still, even divestment is only a first step.   The dominant framework has been about a neoliberal approach and it has failed over and over again,  Ashley Dawson, author of the book  Extreme Cities: The Peril and Promise of Urban Life in the Age of Climate Change,  told HuffPost.  That whole approach is hugely flawed, so I think we need to really think about a much more radical solution.  Dawson pointed to the proposal from British Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn to nationalize the electrical grid and shift the United Kingdom to 65 percent renewable energy by 2030.   We need to have really progressive conversations about how we get from where we are presently to carbon zero state,  he said.  To have a conversation about how to do that on a national scale and how to do that at a really fast rate we need to be talking about a public push rather than the kind of market-based arguments you hear so much in the United States.

Sleepwear company Lunya has decided to use  The Handmaid\u2019s Tale  \u2014 a book and television show about sexual slavery \u2014 to help sell lingerie. On Monday, the company announced that the red shade of one of its  washable silk  sets would be dubbed  Offred  after the protagonist in Margaret Atwood\u2019s 1985 dystopian novel and Elisabeth Moss\u2019 character in the popular Hulu series.   Praise be!  Lunya declares on Facebook and Instagram.  Meet our limited-edition silk set. Join the resistance just in time for #handmaidstale season 2.  In the book and show, Offred is a woman who is kidnapped and forced to have sex with a married couple in order to produce a child for them. She wears red so that she is easily identifiable as someone\u2019s property. Her name also denotes that she is someone\u2019s possession. Offred\u2019s  Commander,  or male captor, is named Fred Waterford (portrayed in the show by Joseph Fiennes), and her new name literally means  of Fred.   The decision to name this color Offred was rooted in the color itself, being a kind of \u2018off Red color,\u2019 and our enthusiasm for the powerful nature of Elisabeth Moss\u2019s character in the show and as a symbol of our solidarity with the Resistance,  Ashley Merrill, Lunya\u2019s founder and CEO, told HuffPost in a statement. In the book and show, Offred is part of the Resistance, an underground movement to overthrow the Republic of Gilead, the totalitarian society that enforces sexual slavery.

      "text": "Prosecutors in Bill Cosby\u2019s sexual assault retrial will present the jury with the disgraced comedian\u2019s 2005 testimony about giving quaaludes to women after a judge ruled it admissible on Tuesday, The Associated Press reported Tuesday. In the testimony, Cosby admitted under oath that he obtained a prescription for the now-illegal drug in the 1970s and gave it to women he wanted to have sex with.  Judge Steven O\u2019Neill\u2019s decision to admit the testimony represents a win for prosecutors, who are attempting to portray Cosby as a habitual abuser in the criminal case brought by former Temple University basketball coach Andrea Constand. It also means that jurors will hear the same admissions as in the original trial \u2015 but this time, paired with testimony from five other accusers. O\u2019Neill ruled in March that the five additional accusers could testify in court because their claims closely match Constand\u2019s. Only one other accuser, Kelly Johnson, who worked for Cosby\u2019s agent, was permitted to give testimony the first time around. Constand says Cosby, now 80, drugged and sexually assaulted her at his Philadelphia home in 2004. He faces three counts of aggravated indecent assault.  On Tuesday, the new jury began hearing Cosby\u2019s account of what happened with Constand, which also came from his 2005 testimony. According to Cosby, he gave Constand cold and allergy medicine at his home to help her relax before touching her sexually. The entertainer said Constand did not object to being touched, and his lawyers say there is no evidence that he gave Constand quaaludes instead of over-the-counter medicine. Johnson won\u2019t take the stand again in the retrial. Instead, prosecutors will try to corroborate Constand\u2019s experience with testimony from former bartender Janice Baker-Kinney and former models Heidi Thomas, Chelan Lasha, Lise-Lotte Lublin and Janice Dickinson.  Cosby\u2019s 2005 testimony originated from Constand\u2019s civil suit against the comedian, brought about a year after the alleged assault. That case was settled for around $3.4 million and the testimony sealed \u2015 until a judge unsealed it in 2015. Authorities then filed charges against Cosby late that year. A hung jury resulted in a mistrial last June. The retrial, however, is the first jury trial of a high-profile figure since the Me Too movement against sexual misconduct started gaining steam. "

      "text": "Dick\u2019s Sporting Goods won\u2019t be returning their unsold assault-style rifles to manufacturers. Instead, the company says it\u2019s chosen to destroy all of them. Dick\u2019s announced in February \u2015 following the school shooting in Parkland, Florida \u2015 that it would stop selling assault-style rifles and high-capacity ammunition magazines in all of its Field & Stream stores, where these items had been sold by the large sports retailer. The company also announced that it would no longer sell guns to people under the age of 21 at any of its stores. A company spokeswoman told The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette last week that the retailer was  in the process  of destroying the unsold inventory of rifles, which include AR-15s and other military-style semi-automatic weapons, at its four distribution centers nationwide.  We are destroying the firearms in accordance with federal guidelines and regulations,  the representative said, adding that weapon parts would be sent to a salvage company to be recycled. Dick\u2019s did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for clarification on how many guns it was destroying or how the company was going to dispose of them.  The National Rifle Association, in a Tuesday Twitter post, lambasted the company\u2019s decision to destroy the weapons.  What a waste,  the gun group wrote. The NRA and other gun-rights advocates have assailed Dick\u2019s for taking a political stance that could end up hurting its business, with some calling for a boycott of the retailer. But the company\u2019s stock price has remained relatively unchanged since February. Under federal regulations, a gun must be  cut, severed or mangled in such manner as to render the firearm completely inoperative and such that it cannot be restored to an operative condition  to be considered destroyed. The destruction of a firearm must also be recorded with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Although there is no officially outlined process for disabling an assault-style rifle, the ATF recommends making a series of cuts to a gun\u2019s receiver, the piece that houses a firearm\u2019s internal components. It\u2019s unclear if Dick\u2019s had the option of returning its assault-style rifles to gun manufacturers, which typically offer dealers partial refunds for unsold firearms.  Gun companies aren\u2019t obligated to accept merchandise back from a retailer or a wholesaler, but they normally do accept it and reimburse minus a restocking fee of 10 percent to 20 percent, which is what the retailer/wholesaler loses from what he originally paid,  said Mike Weisser, a Massachusetts-based gun dealer who has previously blogged for HuffPost as  Mike the Gun Guy.  Dick\u2019s choice to destroy the assault-style rifles rather than return the firearms to a manufacturer that could redistribute them seems consistent with the company\u2019s efforts to take a principled stance in the wake of the Parkland shooting, in which 17 people were killed at a high school.  Thoughts and prayers are not enough,  Dick\u2019s CEO Edward Stack said in February as he announced the company\u2019s decision to end the gun sales.  We support and respect the Second Amendment, and we recognize and appreciate that the vast majority of gun owners in this country are responsible, law-abiding citizens. But we have to help solve the problem that\u2019s in front of us. Gun violence is an epidemic that\u2019s taking the lives of too many people, including the brightest hope for the future of America \u2015 our kids.   Dick\u2019s has pulled assault-style firearms from its shelves before. In the aftermath of the 2012 shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, that killed 26 people, the company stopped selling the rifles at its main stores. It resumed selling them, but only at its 35 Field & Stream stores, in 2013. "

      "text": "While his genius may be largely uncontested, Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s vision of Facebook is badly adrift from reality. He paints the social media behemoth he founded in 2004 as a tool  to bring the world closer together,  but in many ways, it has become an indispensable amplification device for people who want to make it known that they hate other people. Testifying before Congress last Wednesday, Zuckerberg declared:  We do not allow hate groups on Facebook, overall.  As with many things the Facebook CEO said during his trip to the Hill last week, it was difficult to square this statement with the actual experience of using Facebook. Angry observers were quick to point to anti-Muslim, anti-Semitic, anti-Rohingya, anti-LGBTQ and other hateful groups actively operating on the platform. Zuckerberg\u2019s claim hit a nerve for me as well. Two months ago, a private Facebook group devoted to alt-right Trump memes inaugurated a campaign of sexual harassment against me. When alerted to the situation, Facebook\u2019s response was, essentially, \u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af. On Feb. 13, I awoke to find a stream of friend requests on Facebook and a startling message from a man I did not know:  There is some random weirdo posting pictures of you.  He sent me a screenshot of a photo posted in the private Facebook group  Emperor Trumps Dank Meme Stash,  which had more than 72,000 members at the time. There I was: standing on the beach in Oahu, wearing shorts, a bikini top and a cardigan. I loved that photo \u2015 it was a reminder of a day spent hiking and swimming with my family during our first vacation together in years. I posted it on Facebook last April. I was stunned as I stared at it almost a year later, along with my full name, literally hundreds of comments and a caption that read:  This is going to be a hard one guys. Huffington Post reporter, smash or pass?  Immediately, I requested permission to join the closed group and was directed to answer two questions for approval by its administrators:  Where do you fall on the cuck spectrum?  and  Are you a normie?   I turned back to the man who had alerted me to the photo and asked him to send me screenshots of as many of the responses as possible, so I could email them to the appropriate representatives at Facebook. As is common in the publishing industry, HuffPost and Facebook work closely on products, partnerships and other shared objectives.  It is a lot of comments,  he warned.  None of them are nice.  It\u2019s difficult to describe how it feels to discover hundreds of complete strangers debating how fuckable you are. Or to see them casually suggest they\u2019d like to  smash,   pump  and  skullfuck  you as an apparent form of punishment for your gender and job title. Dozens of my friends and coworkers reported the group to Facebook. Several hours later, Facebook responded to them with a message saying it had discovered content that  doesn\u2019t follow our Community Standards.  It added:  We removed that specific content \u2026 instead of the entire group.  But subsequent screenshots showed my photo was still there.  A staff manager at HuffPost also contacted Facebook directly to request that the post be taken down as quickly as possible. His message contained the screenshots of comments and stressed the matter\u2019s urgency. Two days later, a representative followed up and asked him for the link to the post with the photo, which was inaccessible to anyone who did not belong to the private group (and which I had failed to obtain from the growing swarm of  trolls  in my inbox). The Facebook representative said that without the link, not much could be done. So the harassment continued, and it worsened. As my account was flooded with creepy messages and friend requests (now 890 and counting), one of my colleagues wrote a public Facebook post asking others to report the group, hoping that it might expedite the process of getting my picture removed. Soon enough, the trolls found her profile, too.  We\u2019ll just post your pic and do a smash or pass,  one man wrote on her status below two other nasty comments. Another appeared in her inbox:  SMASH.  It was clear that she was also being targeted in  Emperor Trumps Dank Meme Stash.  She deactivated her account. My photo remained posted in the group for at least six days \u2015 long enough for it to garner even more attention and be shared to at least three other pages. So after nearly a week of apparent inaction from Facebook, I got in touch with one of the group\u2019s administrators, who can review reports about members\u2019 posts, remove content and revoke membership as they please. He told me that the picture might have  flown under the radar.    Don\u2019t blame me,  he said, after assuring me he had taken the photo down.  Blame Facebook for their stupid reporting system.  When I asked him to let me join the group, so I could see for myself that it was gone, he refused. With a growing network of more than 2 billion users around the globe, Facebook\u2019s role in shaping the way we communicate online cannot be easily overstated. It has public policies in place to penalize those who violate its Community Standards (including posts containing nudity, hate speech and violent or graphic content). These users may have their content removed or their accounts disabled, or may even be reported to law enforcement.  Moderating hate speech is an issue  that we struggle with continuously,  Zuckerberg said last week.  There\u2019s a lot of content flowing through the systems and a lot of reports, and, unfortunately, we don\u2019t always get these things right when people report it to us.  He vowed that Facebook would have  more than 20,000 people working on security and content review across the company  by the end of the year, acknowledging that  no amount of people that we can hire will be enough to review all of the content.  But instead of advocating for more moderators, pundits have long been calling for greater transparency surrounding the organization\u2019s internal content review standards to ensure consistent enforcement and accountability \u2015 a plea many say has fallen on deaf ears. A Guardian investigation into leaked documents from Facebook, including private guidelines for content moderation, revealed last year that phrases like  To snap a bitch\u2019s neck, make sure to apply all your pressure to the middle of her throat  are allowed, while others like  Someone shoot Trump  are not. The report noted that moderators often have  just 10 seconds  to make a decision when evaluating material. It also said many have concerns about  the inconsistency and peculiar nature of some of the policies,  especially those regarding sexual content. Experts have cautioned that inadequate moderation practices can have serious consequences, such as fostering a culture of online impunity \u2015 leading sites like Facebook to become breeding grounds and safe havens for harassment. Whereas trolls used to work under the cover of relative anonymity on sites like 4chan and Reddit, many of the Facebook users who commented on my photo and sent me grotesque messages, astonishingly, felt comfortable enough to do so using their real profiles \u2015 with their real names, photos, locations and even places of employment listed.  Alejandra, who works at a debt-relief company in Fresno, California, commented:  Smash with a ballgag so she doesn\u2019t speak.  Ironically, in a public bio statement sitting atop her Facebook profile, she has written:  I don\u2019t care who you are if you are kind to me I will be kind to you, it\u2019s that simple.  Michael, a New York-based account manager who was previously a cadet first lieutenant at a military academy in Pennsylvania, wrote that he would  Smash, but I\u2019ll unload on her face\u2026 for the patriarch.  On his professional website, he lists his favorite Bible verse as Psalm 133:  How good and pleasant it is when God\u2019s people live together in unity!  Far from promoting unity, Facebook is an ideal ecosystem for hate groups to flourish. During Zuckerberg\u2019s appearances on the Hill last week, much was made of his site\u2019s explosive growth and transformation, but from my vantage point, staring at screenshots from  Emperor Trump\u2019s Dank Meme Stash,  Facebook looks remarkably unevolved. A platform that grew out of a  hot or not  women-ranking site is now a place for users to debate  smash or pass.   Upon receiving a request for comment for this article on Friday \u2015 two months after HuffPost initially alerted Facebook to the situation \u2015 the organization said it would review  Emperor Trump\u2019s Dank Meme Stash.  By day\u2019s end, the group was taken down.  As groups evolve, we can evaluate their activity over time,  a spokesperson said in a statement that evening.  We have removed this group for violating our policies.  A  revival  page is up and running with nearly 7,000 members.  Free Speech does not exist here,  its description reads.  Blame Zuck.  "

Linden, 34, won with a time more than 14 minutes slower than her previous two races, but course conditions were not conducive to personal- or course-record performances. Fellow American Sarah Sellers was second, 4:10 behind Linden.  I don\u2019t have the right words. I\u2019m thrilled,  Linden said on the TV broadcast immediately after the race.  It\u2019s supposed to be hard. ... I was just lucky to get it done.  Linden finished second in 2011 with a time of 2:22:38. In the men\u2019s 26.2-mile race, Japanese amateur Yuki Kawauchi won in 2:15:58, his first major marathon victory. Kawauchi is known in the running community but works full time for the government in Japan and is without sponsorship. He is not regularly viewed as an  elite  marathon runner. Kawauchi, 31, appeared stunned and emotional at the finish line. While he is a seasoned runner with more than 80 marathon finishes in his career, Monday\u2019s time in Boston adds to his record number of 2:20-and-under marathon finishes. The temperature Monday morning at the start line was announced at 30 degrees and rain fell throughout the race, often heavily, to make for a slower overall pace.  For me, these are the best conditions possible,  Kawauchi said after the race. The last Japanese man to win the Boston Marathon was Toshihiko Seko in 1987. Kawauchi is the ninth Japanese male to win Boston. Kawauchi is dubbed a  Citizen Runner  and holds the world record for the fastest marathon in a full business suit and the top time wearing a panda costume. "

Crews \u2015 along with panelists Joanna Coles, chief operating officer at Hearst Magazines, and Lauren Duca, a journalist \u2015 discussed the recent Me Too movement and how it\u2019s affected cultural perceptions of sex, consent and gender roles.  True to form, Crews took a moment to point out how masculinity contributes to issues of sexual violence and gender inequality.   Masculinity can be a cult,  Crews said.  And when I say \u2018cult,\u2019 it\u2019s no different than David Koresh. It\u2019s no different than Jim Jones.   He said that men \u2015 whether consciously or unconsciously \u2015 rarely see women as  all the way human.    This is what you have to understand \u2015 there is a humanity issue here,  he continued.  [Women are] like, \u2018Why don\u2019t you hear me?

      "text": "LOS ANGELES \u2014 Tony Rosado sits in the silent back room of El Mercado with a giant stack of papers piled in front of him on a sturdy wooden table. The papers are part of his appeals to stop the construction of Lorena Plaza, a 49-unit supportive housing complex that has been proposed for an empty parcel of land next to his market in this historically Latino neighborhood east of downtown.  Why in Boyle Heights?  he asked.  I dare you to go try and build this in Beverly Hills. It would never get through.   El Mercado, which Rosado took over after his father died in 2014, is a three-story restaurant and market packed with stalls of vendors, or puestos, selling cowboy boots, Communion dresses, religious paraphernalia, tubs of obscure moles and dried sweets. Boyle Heights is one of the most heavily Latino communities in the city, and El Mercado is its vibrant nerve center.  Lorena Plaza is one of the complexes that nonprofit developers have proposed to house the 58,000 people experiencing homelessness in Los Angeles. Voters approved a 2017 ballot measure calling for a $1.2 billion bond to fund permanent supportive housing for the chronically homeless. But where exactly that housing should go has proven a much more difficult question.  Boyle Heights is known citywide for its residents\u2019 vigorous anti-gentrification efforts. They\u2019ve fought to keep richer, whiter transplants from encroaching on their territory. In a sense, Rosado\u2019s fight to keep housing for the homeless out of his neighborhood is part of the same struggle for agency. Rosado says Lorena Street isn\u2019t the right place for housing for the homeless. El Mercado gets busy on the weekends, and cars zoom down Lorena Street and into the parking lot. A Metro train line also runs nearby.   To put a sensitive population so close to a busy cultural center and next to exposed railroad tracks?  Rosado said.  I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right thing to do.  The Rosado family has been fighting Lorena Plaza for years. They filed an environmental appeal with the city\u2019s Planning and Land Use Management Committee in May 2017, citing uncapped oil wells on the property that could present a danger to residents if they leaked. The family found a sympathetic ear with Councilmember Jose Huizar, who approved their appeal in the committee and stalled construction until a full environmental review was conducted. Housing developers and other critics claim such resistance pits communities against the will of citywide voters. In an open letter to Huizar during the appeal meetings, L.A.\u2019s top nonprofit developers argued that the appeal  would deny Los Angeles voters the mandate and action they overwhelmingly supported.   We all care and we all want to eradicate homelessness,  said Janet Kim, a Los Feliz resident and member of a multi-neighborhood homelessness task force, SELAH Neighborhood Homeless Coalition, that includes residents from Silver Lake, Echo Park, Los Feliz, Atwater Village and Hollywood. The problem, she said, is  that people are on the fence about how we\u2019re going to do that.  This concern isn\u2019t limited to Boyle Heights. Residents of Venice \u2015 a wealthy, white oceanside neighborhood where companies like Snap Inc., Google, YouTube and Vice have mutated the community into a post-gentrification business district of sorts \u2015 have also fought plans to build housing for the homeless.  Suburbanites in leafy, pleasant Temple City have successfully stalled the redevelopment of a motel that was planned for supportive housing. Property owners in Lincoln Heights are also rallying against a handful of housing proposals.  Five is too many,  reads the mission statement of the Coalition to Protect Lincoln Heights. Still, Rosado thinks his situation in Boyle Heights is different from other conflicts around the city. Residents here feel their voices have been ignored, and say community outreach was inadequate for this kind of development. A Community of Friends, the nonprofit developer seeking to build Lorena Plaza, seems surprised by the backlash. In the past 30 years, ACOF has built 42 supportive housing complexes in the city without much controversy.  The word I would use to describe us was \u2018stealth,\u2019  said Dora Leong Gallo, ACOF\u2019s director.  We built the buildings, we operated and moved people in, and nobody was the wiser. People ask if this is a brand-new thing, like we\u2019ve never done it before. That\u2019s not quite true.  Gallo knows better than most the complexities of building units in a city historically constrained by rigid planning laws, and ACOF usually navigates the process well. But the Lorena Plaza development has been particularly difficult. Gallo believes the Rosados\u2019 environmental appeal was disingenuous. The opposition to Lorena Plaza stems from stereotypes of the homeless, she argued, pointing to the Rosados\u2019 initial appeals. The late Pedro Rosado told a Metro Board hearing in 2013 that he was  very appalled how people are not mentioning that in this facility they are trying to bring mentally ill people to put our children at risk.   Boyle Heights was already primed for a fight over development. Non-local artists have been opening new galleries here, like 356 Mission and BBQ LA, which attracted the ire of activist-residents. Last year, Weird Wave Brewers, a coffee shop owned by two white men and a Latino man (none of whom live in Boyle Heights), opened on Cesar Chavez Avenue, prompting concerns that the neighboring Arts District \u2015 which is demographically wealthier, whiter and younger \u2015 was trickling into the barrio. Rosado argues that the city is taking advantage of the mostly Spanish-speaking, low-income residents of Boyle Heights, and that other neighborhoods would never have to fight so hard to keep out a proposal like this.  They would lobby their representatives and then bombard their offices with calls,  he said.  They would pull all their financial support for their campaigns if their representatives were allowing these types of projects to get through.  He suggested that people experiencing homelessness be housed on the outskirts of the city,  where it\u2019s not the white-collar people that are affected or the blue-collar.  On March 6, the L.A. City Council held a final vote on the Lorena Plaza environmental appeal. Dozens of supporters of the project, identified by fluorescent yellow stickers that said  Lorena Plaza, SUPPORTER,  packed the aisles of City Hall\u2019s chambers. There did not appear to be any critics of the development present. The Rosado family was not in attendance, but their lawyer read aloud a statement arguing that the city is responsible for investigating the environmental concerns thoroughly, and urging the council to pursue a new assessment. ACOF\u2019s Gallo also addressed the council, telling them her organization has  remained optimistic and steadfast in our belief that this is a good project at a good location, and reasonable people who care about the state of homelessness in Los Angeles can successfully negotiate a solution.  Huizar, the councilmember, raised concerns about community involvement in the proposal.   It\u2019s not an issue of NIMBYism or against permanent supportive housing. It\u2019s an issue about community process, building trust, no matter what you\u2019re building \u2015 whether it\u2019s a retail center, permanent supportive housing, commercial,  he said.  Whatever it is, there needs to be trust between the applicant, the developer and the local community, and that\u2019s what was lacking here.  Yet Huizar recommended that his colleagues deny the appeal and allow ACOF to build Lorena Plaza. Then the council cast its vote: thirteen in favor of allowing the development to go forward, and zero opposed.  Gallo said she was pleased with the result, especially Huizar\u2019s about-face.  It\u2019s a pretty incredible feeling to have him change his mind, because it\u2019s hard, and he does want what is best for his community, and I recognize that,  she said. Gallo expects to break ground in fall 2019, with a completion date toward the end of 2020. Tony Rosado said he is  disappointed,  but isn\u2019t backing down yet.  We\u2019re going to continue fighting it,  he said.  We\u2019re going to pursue our legal options.   In a statement to HuffPost, Huizar said the developer has agreed to complete the necessary environmental review, and will ensure the soil is clean. He also emphasized the importance of community involvement as the city seeks housing solutions for people experiencing homelessness.   As we unroll our efforts to construct permanent supportive housing throughout the City, we need to be completely honest with the public from the outset and throughout the approval processes,  he said.  That doesn\u2019t mean everyone will be happy with every project, but unlike this process, at least we\u2019ll all be clear about what is being proposed.  On April 5, Rosado filed suit against the city of Los Angeles, alleging that environmental law had been broken. The writ, submitted by Rosado\u2019s lawyers, asks for the city\u2019s decision to be vacated in lieu of a full environmental review. It also asks for the suspension of the  authority of City and City Council... to grant any authority, permits or entitlements as part of the Project  until a full review is conducted. This story is part of the series Homeless on the Streets of L.A., a four-month investigation by students at USC Annenberg\u2019s Reporting on the Homeless class. The project, overseen by veteran journalists Mary Murphy and Sandy Tolan, continues through early 2019. Contact atolan@usc.edu or mmurphystar@yahoo.com for more info. "

      "text": "Former supermodel Janice Dickinson testified at Bill Cosby\u2019s retrial on Thursday that she fabricated parts of her memoir, including a story that she  rebuffed  the disgraced comedian\u2019s advances.  It\u2019s all a fabrication there because I wanted the paycheck for my kids,  Dickinson testified in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, where Cosby is charged with sexually assaulting a former Temple University women\u2019s basketball coach in 2004.  Dickinson, one of five women set to testify for the prosecution to bolster the account of chief accuser Andrea Constand, said the real story of her 1982 encounter with Cosby in a Lake Tahoe, California, hotel room was that he drugged her and raped her.   Here was \u2018America\u2019s Dad\u2019 on top of me \u2015 a happily married man with five children,  Dickinson testified.  And I remember thinking how wrong it was \u2015 how very, very wrong.  Dickinson said she later confronted Cosby and  wanted to hit  him.   I wanted to punch him in the face,  she said. She admitted fabricating parts of her 2002 ghostwritten memoir, No Lifeguard on Duty: The Accidental Life of the World\u2019s First Supermodel, under cross-examination by Cosby\u2019s attorney, Tom Mesereau.  In the book, Dickinson says she rebuffed Cosby\u2019s advances, popped two Quaaludes, and went to sleep. She testified that the sexual assault was cut from the memoir because her publisher, Judith Regan, said it could ruin her entire career. Under cross-examination, Dickinson said her memoir\u2019s account of that night was  all a fabrication  for a paycheck. The book\u2019s ghostwriter, she said, took  poetic license.   When Mesereau pushed Dickinson to explain the contradiction between the book and her courtroom story of the assault, she replied:  They weren\u2019t there! And you weren\u2019t there! And I\u2019m telling the real story!  She added:  I put my hand on the Bible and I swore. I wasn\u2019t under oath when I wrote the book.  Many memoir writers embellish stories and leave out aspects they don\u2019t want to share. Glossing over the heart of her testimony, however, could present a problem for the prosecution in the second trial for Cosby. The comedian\u2019s first trial ended in a mistrial in June, when the jury failed to reach a unanimous verdict.  Cosby\u2019s lawyer unsuccessfully sought a mistrial earlier this week, days after testimony in the new case got underway. On Wednesday, a visibly emotional Chelan Lasha took the stand and described how Cosby drugged and assaulted her when she was 17 in Las Vegas in 1986.  As she finished testifying and the judge began dismissing court for lunch, Lasha looked at Cosby and said,  You know what you did  or  You remember, don\u2019t you, Mr. Cosby?  according to various reports. The defense objected to the outburst, but Common Pleas Judge Steven O\u2019Neill denied the mistrial request.  "

      "text": "There were moments over the past few years when it seemed like misogynist in chief Donald Trump would be held accountable for the way he has treated women. But at each turn, the president emerged unscathed. Then on Monday, the FBI raid on Trump lawyer Michael Cohen\u2019s office and hotel raised the prospect once again. Cohen\u2019s apparently been under criminal investigation for months, according to court papers prosecutors released on Friday. It is incredibly early to say this with any certainty, but it\u2019s starting to look possible that women could ultimately topple the Trump presidency.  Not Russia. Women.   The scandals prompted by two women, Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal, reportedly led the FBI to Cohen\u2019s door. Federal agents were reportedly seeking information on hush agreements the adult film star and the former Playmate signed to stay silent about their alleged affairs with Trump. The agreements may have violated federal campaign finance laws, raising the real possibility of criminal charges for Cohen \u2015 and maybe even for Trump himself. The nonprofit Common Cause filed complaints with the Department of Justice and the Federal Election Commission in January over the hush agreements, alleging they are campaign finance violations. The punishment for breaking such laws includes fines and even jail time.  At a time when the Me Too movement has brought down many powerful men for sexual misconduct, the alleged violations raise the prospect of bagging the biggest whale of all.  Though the raid this week was a sign of how serious the situation is, there are a million caveats going the other way: First, there is no publicly available evidence that Trump knew about these payoffs. He didn\u2019t even sign the agreement with Daniels and denies he knew about it or had an affair with her or McDougal. Cohen said he paid Daniels without Trump knowing.   Even if the feds nail the evidence, successfully pressing the case in court would be technically pretty tricky, legal experts say. Recently, former presidential candidate John Edwards was charged with campaign finance violations and went to trial, but the jury couldn\u2019t agree on his guilt. Also, recall that no sitting U.S. president has ever been charged with a crime.  The more obvious punitive route would be impeachment, which seems unlikely at the moment because Trump\u2019s party runs Congress. And even if the Dems were running the show, it\u2019s not clear they\u2019d want to make a whole thing out of what seems to be essentially a sex scandal \u2015 20 years after the Lewinsky debacle. (Though not everyone sees this as simply a salacious story.) Further, campaign finance violations aren\u2019t exactly the sexiest, most outrageous crimes around.   And of course, no one knows what special counsel Robert Mueller \u2015 who\u2019s already done a lot of damage to the Trump administration with indictments and criminal charges \u2015 still has up his sleeve. And yet, right now, the campaign finance violations do seem further along than the Russia case to a number of experts.    The public evidence we know on the campaign finance issue is more clear to us at this moment,  said Liam Brennan, a former federal prosecutor who was the lead attorney in the prosecution of former Connecticut Gov. John G. Rowland (R) for campaign finance violations.  From what is publicly known, there is fairly compelling evidence that campaign finance laws were broken,  he said.  Cohen has already admitted he paid Daniels $130,000, but said the president was not involved. McDougal\u2019s $150,000 came from the folks at American Media Inc., home to the National Enquirer, but McDougal\u2019s lawsuit says the company acted in coordination with Cohen. American Media Inc. denies all of this. Though the alleged affairs happened more than a decade ago, the payoffs came right before the election: McDougal\u2019s just after the Republican National Convention in August 2016, Daniels\u2019 a week before the general election, right when the  Access Hollywood  tape was imperiling Trump\u2019s campaign.  The maximum amount an individual can contribute to a campaign is $2,700 \u2015 obviously, far less than $130,000. Corporations are prohibited from making donations to individual candidates. The timing of the payouts increases the likelihood that they\u2019ll be seen as money spent on getting Trump into office \u2015 if the women\u2019s stories had emerged prior to the election, the reasoning goes, they would\u2019ve hurt Trump\u2019s chances. Particularly Daniels\u2019 story, which was kaiboshed during Pussygrab-gate. In fact, according to reporting from The New York Times, FBI agents were also looking for information tied to that infamous recording, wherein Trump brags to host Billy Bush that he is very famous and can just kiss women without asking and grab them by their genitals. If prosecutors are able to build a compelling case against Cohen \u2015 and possibly Trump \u2015 around these payments, it\u2019s plausible that the president could find himself facing criminal charges, legal experts told HuffPost.  That road leads to possible impeachment and even a criminal trial, where the president and his lawyer could face fines and even, yes, jail time \u2015 up to five years, said Paul S. Ryan, vice president of policy and litigation at Common Cause.  Imprisonment is exceedingly rare, but it happens occasionally,  he said. Still, a case would hardly be a slam dunk.  Proving intent in white-collar cases is extremely difficult,  Brennan, the former prosecutor, said.  While it  seems obvious  the intention was to protect the Trump campaign, it can be hard to prove, he said. The keys will be: Will Cohen talk and will agents find compelling hard proof to back up the case?  And it\u2019s an open question as to how seriously anyone is going to take these scandals. The sexual nature of Daniels and McDougal\u2019s stories may make prosecutors and Congress  squeamish,  Brennan added.  (Remember, it\u2019s mostly men making these decisions.) And to get to Trump, legal experts said, there needs to be more evidence.  In order to pin any of this on Trump, he would have needed to know what\u2019s going on,  said Laurie Levenson, a criminal law professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles.  That\u2019s why it\u2019s key to find a link,  she said \u2015 possibly paperwork of some sort, an email or a letter.  At this point, the worst-case scenario for Trump would be a finding that Cohen and others were involved in illegal activity, Levenson said \u2015 some kind of criminal activity, maybe campaign finance violations, but possibly bank fraud, which FBI agents are reportedly also looking into. If Cohen or others talk, they could end up pointing a finger at Trump and saying not only did he know, but he was orchestrating all of this.  You have to make a lot of jumps and assumptions,  she said. Still, the prospect remains delicious. CORRECTION: A previous version of this story said the Lewinsky scandal was 30 years ago. It was 20 years ago. "

      "text": "Viola Davis understands the monumental repercussions sexual assault can have on a woman\u2019s life. The  How To Get Away With Murder  actress spoke at Tina Brown\u2019s 9th Annual Women in the World Summit in New York on Thursday night. She discussed everything from her love for acting to social justice and the importance of diverse representation in Hollywood. During her discussion with MSNBC host Joy-Ann Reid, Davis took a few moments to break down the lifetime effect sexual violence has on its victims.   Women always say that\u2019s the day that they died,  Davis said, referring to the day victims were sexually assaulted.  And that trauma escalates into side effects that are life-changing.  Davis said the trauma of sexual assault can trigger suicidal thoughts, addiction issues, body dysmorphic issues and so much more.   You could go into any prison in this country and, I guarantee you, you could trace it all back to sexual assault,  she added, speaking of women inmates. Watch another highlight from Davis\u2019 interview below. Every 98 seconds, someone is sexually assaulted in the U.S., according to the Rape Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN). Women and girls experience sexual violence at a much higher rate than boys and men, while transgender people experience sexual violence at the highest rate.  We have 324 million people in this country, 51 percent are women, and trust me when one is traumatized and it escalates \u2014 it escalates into rage issues, incarceration, murder \u2014 all kinds of things,  Davis continued.  When Reid asked if there\u2019s any way to depict sexual assault realistically and genuinely in Hollywood films, Davis responded honestly.   When we go to see movies, we want our buttered popcorn and diet soda and Sour Patch Kids \u2014 we want to escape,  she said. She added later:  There\u2019s not a whole lot of laughs in truth sometimes.   Watch Davis\u2019 full Women in the World interview below. "

      "text": "You don\u2019t matter. That\u2019s the message every survivor hears loud and clear when a rape kit goes untested. Behind every kit is a person \u2015 usually a woman \u2015 who has been brutalized in the most intimate of ways. And yet there are estimated to be hundreds of thousands of untested rape kits currently sitting in police storage across the country.  So, how did we get here?  That\u2019s the question actress and activist Mariska Hargitay answers in her new HBO documentary  I Am Evidence,  set to air April 16. The film, produced by the  Law & Order: Special Victims Unit  star and Trish Adlesic, and co-directed by Adlesic and Geeta Gandbhir, takes a human approach to an epidemic that has reduced survivors, their stories and their trauma to a box of evidence.   To me, the backlog is one of the clearest and most shocking demonstrations of how we regard these crimes in our society,  Hargitay says in the film.  Testing rape kits sends a fundamental and crucial message to victims of sexual violence: You matter. What happened to you matters. Your case matters.   In a conversation with HuffPost, Hargitay and Adlesic laid out the herculean task they had in front of them four years ago when they began making this documentary.  One of the things that was so difficult about making this movie is that there is just so much pain involved,  Hargitay said. She hopes the documentary  holds up a real hard mirror  to people who have turned a blind eye to this epidemic.  Watch the trailer for  I Am Evidence  below. Story continues below video.  And the film is a hard one to look away from.  I Am Evidence  features 14 courageous survivors telling their stories of assault and the subsequent poking and prodding that comes with enduring a rape kit.   I am evidence that there is more to that box, there is a human being there. It is not just a kit. This is a person,  a survivor named Erica says in the film.  The women discuss the inevitable re-victimization of being questioned by law enforcement and the agonizing wait to get their kits tested \u2015 a wait that often never ends.  The fact of the matter is, if we have DNA testing, if we have the ability to fix this problem and we don\u2019t test these kits, we\u2019re saying that sexual assault is not important,  Hargitay said.   Since the rape kit backlog hit the public consciousness nearly 10 years ago, 225,000 rape kits have been uncovered, according to a program called End The Backlog. That program is the work of anti-sexual violence nonprofit The Joyful Heart Foundation, which Hargitay founded after thousands of survivors shared their abuse stories with her after she began appearing as Detective Olivia Benson on  SVU.  Testing rape kits is important for several reasons: It can identify an unknown perpetrator, it can confirm the presence of a known suspect, it can confirm a survivor\u2019s account of an assault, it can help solve other cases that might not involve sexual violence, it can exonerate innocent people. And it can connect a suspect to other crimes around the country. Indeed, a disturbing takeaway from the film is just how common serial rapists are. One scene depicts law enforcement officials, who have finally begun testing old rape kits, linking one rapist to two women living in completely different parts of the country. By testing the kits, police are finally catching serial offenders.  I Am Evidence  lays out the root causes of this countrywide backlog: misogyny and racism. The systemic lack of policies and protocols, of resources and funding, and \u2015 most glaringly \u2015 of training for first responders, reflects these prejudices. As with other systems that abuse and disregard marginalized people, poor black women get the worst of it.  Nobody gives a damn about women in this country,  concludes Detroit prosecutor Kym Worthy in the film. Worthy has been tackling the rape kit backlog head-on since 2009, when 11,000 untested rape kits were uncovered in her city. Adlesic said it\u2019s  absolutely necessary  for first responders to receive sexual assault training and recalled an  I Am Evidence  screening last year where a man made a powerful comment during the Q&A portion.   He was quite emotional and spoke about being an emergency room doctor. He hadn\u2019t had the training to conduct a sexual assault kit, and he was so afraid he was going to get it wrong, or make someone feel awful for not knowing how to do it,  she said.  It helped us understand that we really need to advocate for a curriculum in medical schools and law enforcement agencies so that people learn how to do this.  All too often, police officers learn the law, but no one teaches them the varying ways victims respond to trauma. Along with bringing their own prejudices to the job, officers often don\u2019t know what trauma looks like or how trauma affects memory. They also might not realize how often sexual violence triggers involuntary paralysis in a victim \u2015 an often-forgotten  freeze  component of the fight-or-flight reflex \u2015 in order to get them out of the situation alive.  Hargitay described the lack of resources to investigate these crimes, as well as cultural misunderstandings surrounding sexual violence, as a  microcosm  of how we as a country regard women.   Trish and I, we wanted to make a hard-hitting film,  she said.  It is a painful movie to watch, and it\u2019s the facts. And it\u2019s time that we take a look at not sweeping this under the carpet, that we treat women, and treat our society, and all survivors with the humanity, the empathy that they deserve.   Adlesic told HuffPost she hopes this documentary forces people to care about this issue and creates change. Most of all, she hopes this film shows survivors that they\u2019re not alone.  I want them to know that we understand, and that we care and that we want to help give them the support they need and deserve,  she said.  I want survivors to feel heard and know that they matter, and that violence against women matters, and that we walk in hand with you to a better way of life for everyone.    I Am Evidence  will air on HBO on Monday, April 16, at 8 p.m. Eastern.  "

The rival teams squared off in the seventh inning at Boston\u2019s Fenway Park on Wednesday after Yanks batter Tyler Austin charged at Red Sox pitcher Joe Kelly for throwing a ball right into his back. The scene got pretty chaotic: Kelly was retaliating for Austin\u2019s apparently late slide into second base earlier in the game that ticked off Red Sox shortstop Brock Holt, the New York Post reported. Austin cut Holt\u2019s calf with his spikes on that slide, according to MassLive. The benches cleared then as well, but mostly yelling ensued.  Once Austin charged Kelly, though, punches flew and there was plenty of wrestling.  I didn\u2019t want to let anyone push myself around,  Austin said of his mound charge, per the New York Daily News.  That\u2019s why I went out there.  The umps ejected Austin, Kelly, Yanks reliever Tommy Kahnle and Yankees third base coach Phil Nevin in an eventual 10-7 New York victory, ESPN reported. Next time try to play nice, fellas. "

      "text": "UN Women, the United Nations group devoted to gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment, may need to do some internal soul-searching.  Tucked inside the organization\u2019s recent job listing seeking a  storyteller  was some boldly sexist language \u2015 a perfect example of the very kind of gender stereotyping UN Women is devoted to combating. The posting seeks an  extremely talented writer with a knack for crafting compelling content,  the listing reads. Fairly basic language \u2015 but then, under a bulleted list of responsibilities, things take a turn. After reiterating that the writer should be aligned with UN Women, the listing said  tone must be appropriate.  What tone exactly?  Witty, humorous, considerate, masculine (smart sarcasm)  [bolding ours]. After HuffPost reached out to UN Women on Wednesday afternoon, the organization removed the line.   Obviously it came across different from what we intended,  said Elizabeth Nyamayaro, who heads UN Women\u2019s HeForShe campaign, an initiative that seeks to include men in the fight for gender equality. Nyamayaro said that mission was part of the reason the  masculine  language wound up in the ad.  We are looking for someone able to communicate to a broad diverse audience and that includes men,  she said. She said going forward they would do more to monitor the language of their job listings. Nyamayaro emphasized that her group\u2019s mission is gender equality.  Discriminating against women makes absolutely no sense,  she said. She pointed out that the group has had success in pushing large companies closer to parity. Yet it is notable that even an organization committed to gender equality would make such a misstep, an indicator of how elusive the goal can be.   This posting expresses explicit, outward gender bias,  said Joelle Emerson, the founder and CEO of Paradigm, a consulting firm that works with companies on diversity and inclusion strategies to fight discrimination.  It\u2019s shocking to see the word  masculine  appear in a job description for UN Women. Even more offensive, the job posting seems to define \u2018masculine\u2019 as \u2018smart and sarcastic.\u2019  To which we say, really, UN Women? Women can\u2019t possibly be sarcastic? I mean, what with having to look pretty all the time and nurture babies and all, how could women possibly nail an edgy sarcastic tone? Only a masculine voice could possibly be talented enough to figure all this out. A woman looking for a new job sent the listing to HuffPost, saying she was taken aback by the gendered language.  When I first read the ad, I was flummoxed. It just seemed too ironic to be believed \u2015 like it was an Onion version of a job ad. I would normally be very interested in working at the U.N., the ad has certainly given me pause,  wrote the woman, who wished to remain anonymous so her current employer wouldn\u2019t know she was hunting for new work.  The thing is, I know many U.N. workers are genuinely interested in gender equality. But for this specific position, it seems like there\u2019s been some neglect, and that at least some of the people involved have a very backward view of gender. I\u2019m left wondering: Who and how many people vetted this cringe-worthy ad? How many eyes read those words and thought that the tone was just right?  Beyond the blatantly offensive wording, Emerson also pointed out that even that basic-seeming language about looking for a  talented  writer with a  knack  is problematic. The problem is that UN Women seems to be hunting for an innately talented person, not someone with a proven track record or a learner. Some research has shown that this kind of a language in a job listing can turn off female and minority candidates.  This language communicates a belief in innate abilities. You either have it or you don\u2019t,  said Emerson.  We know this type of language can deter candidates from underrepresented backgrounds.  This kind of attitude is somewhat surprising from UN Women, a well-known organization that\u2019s worked with a number of progressive entertainers and has been pushing huge companies on the issue of gender diversity. That said, the UN as a whole isn\u2019t exactly known for being particularly proactive about gender equality. Less than two years ago, the organization came under fire for making the cartoon character of Wonder Woman the honorary ambassador of its female empowerment campaign. This was before actress Gal Gadot resurrected the fictional superhero \u2015 and at a time when several women were in the running to be the first female secretary general in the organization\u2019s history. They lost out to a man. Emma Watson, the actor best known for playing feminist icon Hermione Granger in the  Harry Potter  films, was appointed the UN Women\u2019s Goodwill ambassador in 2014. That same year, she gave a widely hailed speech on gender equality to launch UN Women\u2019s  He for She  campaign, an effort to get men involved in the fight for gender equality. Watson spoke movingly of getting beyond stereotypes about men and women.  Both men and women should feel free to be sensitive. Both men and women should feel free to be strong,  she said.  It is time that we all perceive gender on a spectrum, not as two opposing sets of ideals.  "

The Olympic gymnast and sexual abuse survivor was at Louisiana State University on Wednesday night for a speaking event in partnership with the Delta Gamma sorority. Raisman discussed her book Fierce and what recovery has looked like for her since coming forward with abuse allegations against former USA Gymnastics doctor Larry Nassar.   It\u2019s OK to not be OK,  Raisman told the crowd of more than 1,000 students, The Advocate reports.  Raisman, 23, talked about testifying against Nassar in January during the former doctor\u2019s sentencing hearing. Over 260 athletes accused Nassar of serial sexual abuse under the guise of medical treatment while he was a trainer for USA Gymnastics and at Michigan State University. He received three concurrent sentences of 60 years, 40-125 years and 40-175 years in prison.  I\u2019m not as strong as I looked in those 12 or 13 minutes,  Raisman said of her now iconic impact statement, which she read aloud to Nassar in court.  I don\u2019t think people understand how much it affects me every day ... It took everything I had to be strong in that moment.   She told the crowd that some people still believe she shouldn\u2019t complain about the abuse she endured because of the gold medals she\u2019s won at past Olympics. To that, she responded:  Just because you are winning does not make abuse OK.    I think that it\u2019s important to recognize that this Me Too movement is not just in Hollywood, it\u2019s not just in gymnastics, it\u2019s not just in other sports,  Raisman continued, according to LSU\u2019s Daily Reveille.  It\u2019s everywhere, including colleges. I\u2019m not going to sit here and pretend, nor should anyone else, that sexual assault is not a very big problem on these campuses. It\u2019s not something that\u2019s talked about enough.   In a follow-up interview with The Advocate, Raisman reflected on her recent activism and what she hopes her legacy will be.   I want to be remembered for changing the way that women are looked at. I want to see women be more respected,  she said.  And I hope that one day we get to a point where everyone understands that women don\u2019t have to be modest to be respected.  Need help?

      "text": "A Michigan teen, Mujey Dumbuya, was scheduled to testify against her alleged rapist in court before she vanished from her school bus stop in late January. Days later, she was found dead in the woods. On Wednesday \u2015 the week she would have appeared in court \u2015 prosecutors charged the man, Quinn Anthony James, with her murder in a case that illustrates the fears some girls and women have when reporting assaults. James, 43, had been released late last year on $100,000 bail while awaiting trial. He became a person of interest in the case quickly after Dumbuya\u2019s strangled body was discovered in Kalamazoo, around 50 miles from her home in Grand Rapids. She was 16.  Witnesses said James had been searching for someone to assist him in the murder and disposal of the body, leading authorities to a Detroit man named Gerald Bennett, 58. Together, James and Bennett plotted to kill Dumbuya, Kent County Prosecutor Christopher Becker announced Wednesday. Bennett allegedly received a vehicle from James as payment. Charges against James include first-degree premeditated murder, conspiracy to commit murder, kidnapping and imprisonment, while Bennett is charged with conspiracy to commit murder. Dumbuya\u2019s original allegations against James stem from a reported sexual assault last summer in a parked car located around eight miles from her school, East Kentwood High. James had been employed as a maintenance worker for the school district until administrators learned of the alleged assault. He was fired in November, arrested, charged with four counts of criminal sexual conduct and released on bail.  Becker cited substantial evidence tying James to Dumbuya\u2019s murder, from content on the suspect\u2019s phone to forensic proof. Records placed James near the teen\u2019s home and bus stop the night before she went missing, he said. On the day of her disappearance, Jan. 24, images captured by a trail camera show a vehicle of the same type James had loaned from a dealership that same day \u2015 a black GMC Acadia \u2015  in close proximity  to where her body was found. Prosecutors allege that James lied about his whereabouts during that timeframe. Forensic evidence also  ties James to the victim\u2019s clothing,  prosecutors said. Police located the vehicle Bennett allegedly received at his girlfriend\u2019s residence in Detroit, along with video showing him with James the day before Dumbuya\u2019s disappearance. Prosecutors say James was wiring money to Bennett\u2019s girlfriend.  Fear of retaliation is often cited among reasons women and girls choose not to report sexual assault.  I used to tell them [sexual assault survivors]: That [violent retaliation] something you see on TV. That\u2019s really not going to happen,  Becker told reporters Wednesday after announcing the charges.  This is very rare, an extremely rare event, so I\u2019m not going to take the whole criminal justice system and say this is a failure.  Shortly after Dumbuya\u2019s death, James was arrested on another rape charge in a different case and is currently in jail. A GoFundMe campaign set up to cover funerary costs has raised more than $14,000, surpassing its $10,000 goal. Services were held for Dumbuya in early February. Need help?

Andre Ingram, a graying 32-year-old with fading hopes from a decade in the minor leagues, made his NBA debut for the Los Angeles Lakers against the Houston Rockets in LA on Tuesday. He sank his first shot \u2015 a three-pointer \u2015 and kept making them. He hit 4 of his 5 three-point attempts, and was 6 of 8 from the field overall, scoring 19 points. It was the highest total in a first game by a Lakers rookie since 1993. If you don\u2019t get choked up a tad by the highlights, you need to turn in your human card. The week began routinely enough with what Ingram thought was an exit interview for the Lakers\u2019 G-league team. Instead, he got a hug from Magic Johnson and word that he was being promoted to the actual Lakers. Ingram\u2019s wife, Marilee, in Richmond, Virginia, screamed when she got the news over the telephone, the Los Angeles Times reported. Then she and their two daughters flew out to LA to watch the dream come true.  I just felt some electricity out there,  Ingram told NBA.com.  It was amazing. The crowd, the lights \u2014 it was once in a lifetime.  Ingram played 384 games in the minors on paltry salaries, earning side money as a math tutor, he told TNT. He thanked Marilee for sticking by him. The Lakers lost, 105-99, but that\u2019s so besides the point. A star was born \u2015 at least for a night \u2015 after he had waited so patiently for his chance. Ingram\u2019s call to the Lakers is the perfect bookend to the recent story of a 36-year-old accountant thrust into playing goalie for the Chicago Blackhawks in his first NHL game.

On Wednesday, the White House budget director appeared before the House Financial Services Committee to deliver the semiannual report of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, of which he is also the acting head, and to dispel rumors that he might run to replace Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) as speaker of the House. Mick Mulvaney is a busy man. Or maybe not. A day before the hearing, The Associated Press reported that the CFPB has not taken a single enforcement action against any financial institution during the six months Mulvaney has been at the helm. Under his predecessor, Richard Cordray, the agency issued two to four fines and settlements per month. The CFPB has jurisdiction over payday lenders, banks, credit unions and just about any institution involved in extending credit to American families. The apparent improvement in corporate behavior beginning in November struck Democrats on the committee as an extraordinary coincidence.  Are you telling me that every single financial institution in America has suddenly snapped into full compliance with every single consumer financial law since you took over?  demanded an incredulous Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.). Mulvaney explained that the CFPB is still litigating 25 cases Cordray brought to court.  I have not burned the place down.  (That the prior director had been able to walk and chew gum simultaneously was not lost on anyone.)  During other rounds of questioning, Mulvaney emphasized that he is helping the bureau focus on  more quantitative analysis  in its work and hopes for more guidance from Congress on the meaning of the words  abusive,   deceptive  and  material  for help in writing and enforcing regulations.  When he accepted the job, Mulvaney said that President Donald Trump had told him to  fix  the CFPB and  get it back to the point where it can protect people without trampling on capitalism.  In his written statement Wednesday, he informed Congress he had developed  new strategic priorities,  including an imperative to  recognize free markets  and  take a prudent, consistent and humble approach to enforcing the law.  No one will accuse him of inconsistency. It was appropriate for Mulvaney to be defending his record on the day Ryan announced he would not run for re-election in November. Both men began their careers in Washington as leading lights of a younger generation of libertarian-leaning Republicans ferociously opposed to government spending and the regulatory state birthed by Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal. In the name of freedom, capitalism and competition, they hoped to slash programs for the poor and taxes for the rich, singing praises to the rule of law over the rule of men.  And yet both politicians have achieved their greatest purpose as agents of Trump, dutifully pressing ahead with narrow priorities while ignoring concerns about every element of their leader\u2019s program that should have frightened small-government advocates \u2015 epic military spending, violent deportations, Russian election-meddling and a soft spot for white nationalism. Their careers illustrate what the libertarian political project in America has become: an unprincipled protection racket for the rich. Ryan delivered them a smashing tax cut, while Mulvaney ensures that garden-variety predation goes uncorrected. The CFPB is charged with monitoring markets and writing new regulations where necessary, but its primary purpose is to guard against simple theft. During his tenure as director, Cordray returned $12 billion in ill-gotten gains from financial firms to American households \u2015 much of it from  undisclosed fees,   unauthorized withdrawals  and similar behavior that people who did not go to law school refer to as  theft.  For this, congressional Republicans did their best to convert him into a national pariah, and the CFPB\u2019s semiannual report to Congress became an exercise in ritualized paranoia. Last year, Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) assailed Cordray for  racism,   sexism,   intimidation,  and  retaliation,  as Republicans took turns shouting down and denouncing Cordray in a spectacle described by the notoriously radical American Banker trade newspaper as an  onslaught, during which Cordray was often denied the ability to respond.  Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) suggested Cordray\u2019s agency had aided insider trading, while Rep. Ann Wagner (R-Mo.) declared that Cordray had somehow fallen down on the job by exposing the fake accounts scandal at Wells Fargo and fining the bank $100 million.  On Wednesday, Republicans could not quite give up the tradition, even with one of their own in the hot seat. Rep. Andy Barr (R-Ky.) denounced Cordray for conspiring against  our men and women in uniform,  while committee Chairman Jeb Hensarling (R-Texas) declared the CFPB  the single most powerful and unaccountable agency in the history of the Republic.   Few people remember the day the United States Senate confirmed Richard Cordray as the day American liberty died, and so Hensarling had to invoke a few hypothetical outrages to get the thin crowd\u2019s blood moving. The CFPB\u2019s budget is derived from the Federal Reserve rather than through the congressional appropriations process. What would happen if the CFPB approved millions of dollars to outbid AT&T for the naming rights to the Dallas Cowboys stadium? What if the CFPB sent a T-shirt to every man, woman and child in the United States? A solemn Mulvaney said that no one could stop him from engaging in such despotism if he so chose. Hensarling found the situation  borderline insane,  and it was hard to disagree with him.  Even a congressional oversight hearing for the agency did not really count as oversight. Mulvaney repeatedly insisted that the 2010 Dodd-Frank law that created the CFPB did not require him to  answer questions  or  testify  before Congress, only to  appear.  Hensarling agreed that this was a matter of very grave concern, but the GOP dropped the affair after Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) pointed out the exact same language is used in the Federal Reserve Act to compel the Fed chairman\u2019s regular reports to Congress. And yet, despite the habitually apocalyptic rhetoric from Republicans, it will likely be Democrats who deliver the most serious lasting damage to the CFPB under Trump. In March, the Senate passed a bank deregulation package that would, among other things, help banks hide racial discrimination in the mortgage market, undermine consumer protections for mobile home loans and eliminate a host of predatory lending standards for smaller banks. The bill was crafted by Senate Republicans and four Democrats \u2015 Sens. Mark Warner (D-Va.), Heidi Heitkamp (D-N.D.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.) and Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.), who distributed a breathtakingly dishonest  Myth vs. Fact  sheet to drum up support. Ultimately, 17 Democrats voted for the bill, including the party\u2019s 2016 vice presidential candidate, Tim Kaine (D-Va.). Unless the Republican-controlled House completely loses its collective mind, the bill will be signed into law by President Trump. The libertarian movement within the Republican Party is dead. American democracy doesn\u2019t look much healthier. "

      "text": "Trans model Leyna Bloom posted on Twitter over the weekend to pursue her latest goal: She\u2019s trying to be the first trans model of color \u2015 or of any race \u2015 to appear in a Victoria\u2019s Secret fashion show. And the tweet took off like wildfire; it currently has over 15,000 retweets. Bloom has been professionally modeling since 2014, appearing in major runway shows and making history on magazine covers (she was featured in Vogue India last year).  But she told Yahoo Lifestyle that Victoria\u2019s Secret was her  dream  company to work with.   It\u2019s always been a dream for me, like so many others, not just trans \u2014 POC, all women, and some men even,  she told the publication.  This is a platform that glorifies femininity. I always felt in my most natural state I am heavenly. For my trans sisters, regardless of color, this will be a moment for us all.  Bloom\u2019s campaign has continued to gather steam, with many supporters tweeting their well-wishes: Victoria\u2019s Secret has been under fire for years for the brand\u2019s lack of diversity, particularly in their fashion shows, when it comes to size, race and more. Fellow model Ashley Graham has been an active proponent for the show to have more of a variance in model sizes. As for trans models, Bloom isn\u2019t the first to make moves for the runway. In 2013, a Change.org petition asked Victoria\u2019s Secret to make Carmen Carrera the first transgender model for the brand. Launched by a former  RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race  contestant, Marco Regalado, the campaign hoped that Carrera\u2019s appearance on the runway would open the brand\u2019s doors to  ALL types of women.   To see a transgender model walk would show that trans women are to be taken seriously and that Angels are selected because of their character and talent,  he wrote.  As a brand, Victoria\u2019s Secret should feel comfortable marketing towards ALL types of women.  For Carrera\u2019s part, she seemed open to the idea, but nothing ever came of it. Five years later, we still haven\u2019t had a trans woman walk in the show. Perhaps Bloom\u2019s endeavor will be more successful.  Victoria\u2019s Secret did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. "

      "text": "This year, big companies in the United Kingdom were forced to do something amazing: actually reveal the difference in how men and women are paid. Thanks to a law passed last year, businesses in the U.K. that employ more than 250 workers are now required to report gender differences in both hourly wages and bonus pay. More than 10,000 companies reported data by the April 4 deadline.  The numbers were bleak, though hardly surprising. As they do all over the world, women in the U.K. make less than men. Women\u2019s median pay is close to 10 percent less than men\u2019s, the data showed. At 80 percent of businesses that reported data in the U.K., men outearn women. But the numbers revealed something else. By breaking things down by wage level, the data reveal what percentage of the best- and worst-paying roles are held by women. In doing so, they show a major reason for the pay disparity:  Women are making less not because men earn more for the same work, but because women aren\u2019t getting the best-paying jobs. At the granular level, the numbers were truly eye-popping. Men earn more than double what women make at some companies, demonstrating that when it comes to equal pay, women aren\u2019t just facing a  gap,  they\u2019re staring down a vast, dystopic hole of inequity. The male-dominated finance industry was one of the worst offenders. At Goldman Sachs in the U.K., women earn 55.5 percent less than men, according to data the company submitted. Other global finance firms in the U.K. reported similar numbers. Women at Barclays make 48 percent less on average than men. At HSBC, the gap is 59 percent. JPMorgan reported paying women 36 percent less on average. At Goldman, 83 percent of the top-paying jobs are held by men, the company\u2019s data showed. At Barclays, men represent 81 percent of the bank\u2019s top earners. Even at the U.K. outpost of Cond\u00e9 Nast, publisher of Vogue, Vanity Fair and Glamour, where women are a majority at every pay level, men still outearn women by 36.9 percent on average because of a few highly paid men sitting at the tippy top. The revelations from the U.K. shine a light on the key issue when it comes to the gender pay gap. Women don\u2019t stand a chance at pay equality if they\u2019re not making it to the top. And the findings are worth paying attention to in the U.S., especially this Tuesday, a symbolic day of the year for women. It\u2019s Equal Pay Day, the day women finally  catch up  in earnings to what men made in 2017. It\u2019s also when everyone who cares about gender equality will be offering up their take on why the pay gap exists \u2015 women earn 80 percent of what men make on average in the U.S. \u2015 and how to fix it. The companies that reported data in the U.K. offered mostly toothless solutions. In a letter to its employees, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein and its president and CEO heir apparent David Solomon acknowledged that there aren\u2019t enough women in senior roles. They\u2019re totally working on it, they said. The company is committed to having women make up 30 percent of the jobs at the vice president level and above by 2023 (that\u2019s not equality, btw). Blankfein and Solomon also are looking to have women make up half of its entry-level workforce in three years. Those goals are somewhat laudable \u2015 though awfully late in the making, since gender equality in banking is something that\u2019s been talked about for decades. Mostly they seem like PR. Big companies have been launching  women\u2019s initiatives  for a long time and still there\u2019s been little movement at the top.  For the truth about who holds the power at Goldman, just look at who was in the running to succeed Blankfein as CEO: Solomon and another man. Hardly a diverse slate of candidates. It\u2019s likely there were few suitable female candidates internally, as there are only two female executive officers out of 11 at the company.  There are far too many women and men who think the reason women aren\u2019t making it up the ladder lies with the women themselves: They  leave before they leave,  Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg once said, dialing down ambition because they want to have a family. Or they don\u2019t  lean in,  as she famously put it, placing the blame more on women for not being aggressive enough. And studies have shown clearly that women who become mothers face huge disadvantages at work because they do have to devote time to child-rearing.  However, that\u2019s only part of the reason women aren\u2019t making it up the corporate ladder. Many leave because they\u2019re sexually harassed. Others quit because they\u2019re not getting promoted by the boys\u2019 club at the top. And those promotions aren\u2019t coming, in part, because of stereotypes. The men in charge hold certain beliefs about what women want out of their careers \u2015 and often they don\u2019t bother checking to make sure their beliefs line up with reality. When she was an investment banker at JPMorgan, Sacha Nitsetska, talked to more than 100 women there, asking them what the bank could do to keep women from leaving.  The answers were very similar: increased pay transparency, clarity on career progression and bonuses, and mentorship from the seniors,  Nitsetska writes in a post for the U.K. site efinancialcareers.  But when she told senior management about her findings, she said, they did not believe her.   I was told that none of this was true and that in fact, the women are leaving because \u2018they want to raise children,\u2019  she writes. At JPMorgan in the U.K., 78 percent of the top-paying jobs are held by men. Presumably many of those men have children, but somehow they\u2019re making it work.  "

      "text": "The head of programming at HBO says that the network has examined all of its shows and corrected gender pay disparities among staff, inspired by  Big Little Lies  star and producer Reese Witherspoon and the larger Time\u2019s Up movement.  One of the things that\u2019s come out of thinking about the movement and some conversations with Reese, who\u2019s really at the forefront, is something we\u2019ve done recently,  Casey Bloys, HBO\u2019s president of programming, told The Hollywood Reporter in an interview published Monday.  We\u2019ve proactively gone through all of our shows \u2014 in fact, we just finished our process where we went through and made sure that there were no inappropriate disparities in pay; and where there were, if we found any, we corrected it going forward.   Bloys would not elaborate on which of the network\u2019s shows required adjusting pay. A spokesman for HBO declined to comment further. Witherspoon\u2019s representative did not respond to a request for comment. Other popular shows and networks have had to address similar pay gaps. Netflix\u2019s  The Crown  generated controversy when producers admitted that actress Claire Foy was paid less than male costar Matt Smith, despite Foy playing the central character.  Bloys said that pay would be commensurate with experience but that the network sought to eliminate  wildly disparate  pay, especially when a show is successful.  When you\u2019re putting a show together, people come in with different levels of experience and maybe some people have won awards or something that makes them stand out,  he said.  But when you get into season two or three of a show and the show is a success, it is much harder to justify paying people wildly disparate numbers.  Witherspoon has been an outspoken leader of Hollywood\u2019s Time\u2019s Up movement, which established a legal defense fund to assist women across all industries facing sexual harassment and other gender-related workplace injustices. The popularity and critical acclaim of  Big Little Lies  last year, which Witherspoon and costar Nicole Kidman helped bring to HBO, marked a watershed moment for shows created by and about women. Originally slated as a limited series, the show\u2019s second season will air in 2019. "

Nicolle Rochelle, an actress and activist from Little Falls, New Jersey, told People that she wanted Cosby to feel  uncomfortable  on his first day in court.  He\u2019s a man who\u2019s disempowered women\u2019s bodies for decades. It doesn\u2019t seem to be recognized,  Rochelle said.  The case is being publicized with this narrative of race. He\u2019s being painted as the victim. I wanted to emphasize that this is about rape. I wanted to make him uncomfortable and to make people think about women\u2019s bodies.   Authorities quickly apprehended Rochelle, who identified herself as part of the international women\u2019s organization Femen, and charged her with disorderly conduct, which can result in a fine. The 39-year-old had  women\u2019s lives matter  written on her chest in red and the names of Cosby\u2019s alleged victims written in black all over her body, as shown in uncensored photos taken during her arrest (below). According to IMDb, Rochelle appeared in four episodes of  The Cosby Show  between 1990 and 1992, and has also acted on shows including  Law & Order: Special Victims Unit  and  Clarissa Explains It All.   Rochelle told People that the protest had nothing to do with her time working on  The Cosby Show.  Instead, it\u2019s about the 50-plus women who have alleged the comedian drugged and sexually assaulted them.   At the moment, 61 women aren\u2019t allowed to testify against him. That\u2019s pretty appalling. The very least I could do is lend my body to this cause,  she said. She added:  There\u2019s a part of me that feels betrayed because I can understand what the victims were feeling. Like, that could have been me, I could\u2019ve undergone the abuse as well.   Cosby, 80, is charged with three counts of aggravated indecent assault for allegedly drugging and sexually assaulting Andrea Constand, a former women\u2019s basketball coach at Temple University, in 2004. In June, a jury failed to reach a unanimous decision on the charges and the judge declared a mistrial. "

      "text": "Arjan Singh Bhullar, the first Sikh fighter signed by the American mixed martial arts organization Ultimate Fighting Championship, will have another historic milestone to celebrate this week.  The 31-year-old will square off against Adam Wieczorek on Saturday in Glendale, Arizona, and wear a turban \u2015 a Sikh article of faith \u2015 as he makes his way to the ring. He\u2019ll be the first UFC fighter to do so. Gurwin Singh Ahuja, executive director of the National Sikh Campaign, told HuffPost he hopes Bhullar and his turban, also known as a dastaar, will raise awareness about the Sikh community.   A majority of Americans do not even know who Sikhs are!  Ahuja told HuffPost.  I think Bhullar\u2019s appearance will help introduce the broader public to the Sikh community, and I think his career will inform people that Sikhs are fighters and that we fight for equality.   Bhullar\u2019s upcoming fight is particularly significant as it lands on Vaisahki, a festival that observes the founding of the body of fully initiated Sikhs known as the Khalsa. Bhullar, who in his UFC debut last September also became the group\u2019s first fighter of Indian descent, hasn\u2019t always been able to showcase his pride in his heritage. He had planned to wear his turban to his initial match, but UFC policies barred that. A UFC spokesman told HuffPost that Bhullar did not follow the group\u2019s  approval process for a change in apparel. Once UFC was given more time to vet the request, approval was granted. Going forward, he will be allowed to walk to the octagon [ring] with a turban.  Bhullar told ESPN UK that the September incident  was disappointing and upsetting and frustrating.  He said that UFC officials needed  some educating and getting them on the same page, but I think we\u2019ve done that.  Bhullar, who has a 7-0 record in his bouts, has said that his identity as an Indian-Canadian Sikh is central to who he is. His grandfather arrived in Canada from India in 1959 and faced racism because of his beard and turban, the fighter told the video show MMA Hour. Bhullar\u2019s father took up wrestling as a way to protect himself at a time when the turban was not accepted, Vice Sports reported, and also used the sport as a way to connect with his peers. Bhullar himself represented Canada in wrestling at the 2012 Summer Games in London, before turning to the sport of mixed martial arts.  Considering his family\u2019s past and legacy, he said he has a duty to honor those before him.   I always try to represent, to be more than just an athlete, more than just your sport, I consider it selfish to be going in there and just fighting\u2026 So many people in my community have sacrificed for me to be in the position I\u2019m at,  Bhullar told Global News.  More than 60 percent of Americans knew nothing about Sikh Americans, a 2015 study revealed. The survey also found that when seeing someone wearing a turban, Americans were more likely to assume the individual was Muslim or Middle Eastern rather than Sikh. And according to the poll, more than half of Sikh children faced bullying in schools, with rates even more drastic for those wearing turbans.   It is frankly commonly associated with terrorism and religious extremism,  Ahuja said of the turban.  Sikhs, though, wear it as a show of commitment to values that include service, compassion, and honesty. Ahuja said that with more visibility and representation, perhaps people will  correctly associate that the person who wears a turban will fight for equality and the rights of all people.   We want UFC fans to know that ... for hundreds of years, Sikhs have fought, and many have given their lives, to protect the rights of others\u2014including Hindus, Christians, and Muslims\u2014to practice their own religions,  he said.  Ultimately, our turban represents our commitment to fight for those values.  This story has been updated with a statement from UFC.  "

      "text": "Catt Sadler is a woman on a mission. The E! News co-host resigned in December after she says she found out her male counterpart had been making  close to double  her salary. Now, she\u2019s using her experience to raise awareness of pay inequality ahead of Equal Pay Day on April 10.  Sadler talked with HuffPost, in partnership with Luna Bar, about her  highly unexpected  resignation, what it\u2019s been like to become one of the most public faces of equal pay, and how she\u2019s fighting to make sure fewer women have to go through what she did. Sadler, who worked at the entertainment network for close to a decade, hasn\u2019t let her job loss slow her down. Instead, she said it has galvanized her into action.    I\u2019m now really leaning into it because I know of the need for faces and voices and activists doing their part to make a change,  Sadler said of her newfound role.  I feel honored, in a sense. Every choice I\u2019m making and career move that I am engaging in is in line with all of this.  Sadler said she was overwhelmed by the  massive  support she received after she quit her E! job.   It really affirmed that it\u2019s not my story it is hundreds of thousands of women\u2019s stories, who are making 80 cents on the dollar compared to what men are making,  she said.  Sometimes it\u2019s worse if you\u2019re a Latina woman or a black woman \u2015 the statistics are even more glaringly bad.   White women make close to 80 cents for every white man\u2019s dollar, while Latina women make 54 cents, and black women make 63 cents, according to a 2018 report from the American Association of University Women. On average, Asian women make 87 cents to every white man\u2019s dollar.  While equal pay is an important topic, it\u2019s sometimes hard to discuss because so many factors contribute to pay inequality. Race, ethnicity, geography, age and privilege are components that can make the pay gap convoluted and complex.  To simplify the comparison, Sadler said there\u2019s one tool women in all industries can use today to combat pay inequality.   The thing that stands out the most to me is transparency. I feel like it\u2019s been so incredibly taboo, it\u2019s the one thing that is not talked about,  she said.  People walk around and nobody knows who\u2019s making what or why. You look at the sports industry and everybody knows what Tom Brady\u2019s making, right? What you make has been this dark little secret. I\u2019m a living-breathing example of that, I just had no idea.  Sadler pointed to the recent coverage of pay disparity between Hollywood stars in big films like  All The Money In The World  and Netflix\u2019s  The Crown.   I like what I see so far just in the last year of more and more news stories and things that are hitting the media and the companies that are at least responding to that,  she said.  I think companies are going to start responding in ways that they haven\u2019t been pressured to in the past, and that\u2019s huge. ... With more and more responses to what\u2019s happening, I think we\u2019ll be left with change.  Another piece of the puzzle is men. Male allies are integral in the fight, Sadler said.   I\u2019d like to hear from more guys, we\u2019re all on the same team at the end of the day,  said Sadler, who noted she\u2019s raising two boys of her own.  You know you look back at red carpet season even a little bit, and a lot of women were finally having this platform to use their voices and that was wonderful. But I would\u2019ve liked to have heard from more men. I would\u2019ve liked that question pointed at the guys. Because, again, we\u2019re all in this together. I would ask men to continue to speak up and if they\u2019re not already, please start.  Although structural changes are needed to close the pay gap, Sadler said women\u2019s livelihoods are  ultimately up to us.   I\u2019m a journalist. I\u2019m educated. I read a lot. But I wasn\u2019t even aware until it happened to me,  Sadler said of the pay gap.  So I think it\u2019s important for everybody, regardless of race or gender \u2015 the guys too \u2015 to invest enough to really become aware. Because at the end of the day, when women make more money, everybody \u2015 society as a whole \u2015 benefits.  "

In the article published on Monday, D\u00edaz describes dodging a question from a fan he met at a book signing who he refers to as  X.  According to D\u00edaz, X confronted the  This Is How You Lose Her  author about the abuse present in his novels and asked if he had experienced it himself. D\u00edaz wrote that at the time he was wearing a  mask of normalcy  and was  too scared  to answer X, who left the signing disappointed. D\u00edaz said he was haunted by the interaction. In the essay, D\u00edaz apologizes to X and finally answers the question, despite it being  years too late.  He wrote:  Yes, it happened to me. I was raped when I was eight years old. By a grownup that I truly trusted. After he raped me, he told me I had to return the next day or I would be \u2018in trouble.\u2019 And because I was terrified, and confused, I went back the next day and was raped again. I never told anyone what happened, but today I\u2019m telling you. And anyone else who cares to listen.  The Dominican-American author, who is also a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, also wrote candidly about how the rapes affected his youth, leading to depression and rage. D\u00edaz said the abuse caused him to bite his tongue in his sleep due to nightmares, fall behind in school and attempt suicide. Later in life, he experienced intimacy problems and had difficulty retaining romantic relationships. It also affected his writing. D\u00edaz cites the rapes as part of the reason for an 11-year gap between his first book,  Drown,  and the novel he won his Pulitzer for,  The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao.   It fucked up my childhood. It fucked up my adolescence. It fucked up my whole life,  he wrote.  More than being Dominican, more than being an immigrant, more, even, than being of African descent, my rape defined me. I spent more energy running from it than I did living.  D\u00edaz credits hard work in therapy for finally beginning his healing process.  After long struggle and many setbacks, my therapist slowly got me to put aside my mask,  he wrote.  Not forever, but long enough for me to breathe, to live.  "

Facebook makes a lot of advertising money off this,  Wozniak told USA Today via email.  The profits are all based on the user\u2019s info, but the users get none of the profits back.   He also told the newspaper that he had deactivated his account, but did not delete it to keep control over his  SteveWoz  screen name.  I don\u2019t want someone else grabbing it, even another Steve Wozniak,  he said. Before deactivating the account, Wozniak posted a goodbye message.   It\u2019s brought me more negatives than positives,  he wrote.  Wozniak is the latest public figure to ditch the social network after a whistleblower revealed that the personal data of millions of users had been improperly shared with a third party.  Last month, Tesla CEO Elon Musk not only quit Facebook, he also pulled the pages for Tesla, SpaceX and SolarCity. Brian Acton, a cofounder of WhatsApp, urged people to delete Facebook, which bought his company for $19 billion in 2014.  Playboy also deleted its Facebook presence.  A number of celebrities have left Facebook as well, including comedians Will Ferrell and Jim Carrey.   We must encourage more oversight by the owners of these social media platforms,  Carrey told CNBC in February, saying he was also dumping his stock in the company.  This easy access has to be more responsibly handled. What we need now are activist investors to send a message that responsible oversight is needed. What the world needs now is capitalism with a conscience.  Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify in Congress this week in connection with the company\u2019s data practices and the scandal surrounding it.  "

At Saturday night\u2019s match between the Winnipeg Jets and the Chicago Blackhawks in Winnipeg, players wore jerseys with the same team name,  Broncos,  printed on their back as their nameplates.  In place of individual names, \u2018Broncos\u2019 is meant to symbolize the unity and support of our hockey communities coming together as one for the Humboldt Broncos\u2019 family,  the National Hockey League said in a press release.  Tonight, we\u2019re all Broncos,  the NHL tweeted while sharing a video of the teams\u2019 touching pre-game tribute that included a photo of the young players, aged 16 to 21, on the arena\u2019s jumbotron. Similar moments were seen before matches in cities including Edmonton, Toronto, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Boston, Philadelphia, Detroit, Nashville and Denver.  Hockey is family,  the Arizona Coyotes organization tweeted following a moment of silence during the team\u2019s match against the Anaheim Ducks. The Broncos\u2019 emblem was also seen on players\u2019 helmets, including the Toronto Maple Leafs and Las Vegas\u2019 Golden Knights.  A GoFundMe account created for the Broncos\u2019 players and family members had received more than $3 million in donations as of Sunday. The Los Angeles Kings also announced that they will donate the proceeds from their Saturday night raffle to those affected by the crash. Other teams have vowed similar donations. The Broncos\u2019 team captain, as well as nine other players, two coaches, a radio play-by-play announcer and a statistician from the Saskatchewan Junior Hockey team, were all killed in the bus crash while heading to a semifinal playoff game. One of the players killed, 21-year-old Logan Boulet, had been on life support up until Saturday night. His family later shared that his organs would be donated to help at least six different people.  Logan made it clear previously that he signed his donor card as soon as he turned 21. Even in his eventual passing, he will be a selfless hero,  his family said in a statement obtained by Canada\u2019s Global News. "

During one of his self-help lectures last month in San Jose, California, Robbins suggested that proponents of the movement to end sexual harassment and assault were failing to take responsibility for their own actions. Tarana Burke, who created the #MeToo hashtag, slammed Robbins in a series of tweets Saturday.  This moment is so damaging especially with how influential @TonyRobbins is,  Burke tweeted.  His misogyny runs deep.  Robbins, a wildly popular motivational speaker, attempted to clarify his comments in a statement Sunday, calling the Me Too movement a  beautiful force for good.   My comments failed to reflect the respect I have for everything Tarana Burke and the #MeToo movement has achieved,  Robbins said in the statement.  I apologize for suggesting anything other than my profound admiration for the #MeToo movement.   It is clear that I still have much to learn,  he added. A video of Robbins controversial remarks went viral after Burke weighed in on them Saturday. In the video, a woman identified as Nanine McCool is seen confronting Robbins over his stance on the Me Too movement.  I think you misunderstand the Me Too movement. I think \u2015  McCool says before Robbins cuts her off.  I\u2019m not mocking the Me Too movement. I\u2019m mocking victimhood,  Robins said.  Look at these people and see what is empowerment. Anger is not empowerment.   What you\u2019re seeing is people making themselves significant by making somebody else wrong,  he continued.  And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that \u2015 it just won\u2019t make you happy. It won\u2019t make them better. It won\u2019t make you better.   "

      "text": "UPDATE: April 10 \u2015 Tony Robbins issued an apology Sunday afternoon to say his comments  failed to reflect the respect I have for everything Tarana Burke and the #MeToo movement has [sic] achieved.   \u2033[S]ometimes, the teacher has to become the student and it is clear that I still have much to learn,  Robbins continued in the statement, which did not address his praise of a male client who declined to hire a qualified woman on the basis of her good looks. Actress Jessica Chastain, an outspoken advocate of gender equality, seemingly criticized that moment from Robbin's March event over Twitter on Tuesday.    If you don\u2019t hire a qualified interviewee because of fear that you\u2019ll be tempted to sexually harass her, perhaps you should consider speaking to a mental health expert about impulse control,  she wrote.  PREVIOUSLY:  Something amazing happened during one of Tony Robbins\u2019 huge self-help lectures \u2015 but it was not his doing.   A woman identified as Nanine McCool stood up in the audience to call out Robbins\u2019 take on the Me Too movement in San Jose, California, last month after he tried to characterize some of its proponents as people who don\u2019t take responsibility for themselves. Robbins also bizarrely championed a man who chose not to hire a qualified female applicant because of her looks. As video of the event began circulating on social media, Tarana Burke \u2015 who created the #MeToo hashtag \u2015 chimed in herself.   I was made aware of this video BEFORE I ever saw it because Tony Robbins\u2019 people reached out to do damage control within 24 hours,  Burke said over Twitter.  They wanted to \u2018give me context\u2019 apparently. I don\u2019t need any. I have eyes. The full video is 11 mins. And it\u2019s gross. Bravo to this woman.  Some on Twitter replied saying the full six-hour event cast Robbins\u2019 comments in a different light, but Burke was still not convinced.  His misogyny runs deep,  she continued in her series of tweets, going on to explain exactly what the movement was all about \u2015 not victimhood, but survivors.  Robbins made a name for himself in the \u201980s and \u201990s by authoring a series of self-help books. He now tours the world giving lectures and has been featured on the Oprah Winfrey Network. McCool, handed a microphone, attempted to voice her concern over Robbins\u2019  mischaracterization  of the Me Too movement during the event while the life coach repeatedly drowned her out.   I\u2019m not knocking the Me Too movement,  Robbins said, claiming that McCool\u2019s explanation was simply her own  experience.   I\u2019m knocking victimhood,  Robbins said.  What you\u2019re seeing is people making themselves significant by making somebody else wrong,  he continued, before invoking Jesus, stones and glass houses.  Still, McCool calmly tried to tell Robbins that many of the movement\u2019s proponents are advocating for safety at home and at work, to create environments that are free from sexual harassment and violence.  I think you do the whole movement a disservice,  she said.  Robbins then tried using McCool to illustrate his argument, pushing his fist against her fist in a spectacle made more uncomfortable given the so-called guru\u2019s towering 6-foot, 7-inch stature.   When you push someone else, it doesn\u2019t make you more safe. It just makes them angry,  he said.  ( It\u2019s awareness. It\u2019s not pushing,  a voice near the source of the video can be heard saying in response.) Robbins then shared a story about a  very famous man, very powerful man  who seemed to illegally decline to hire a woman because, even though she was the most qualified candidate, he considered her good looks a liability.  Burke had something to say about that, too: HuffPost reached out to a representative for Robbins but did not receive an immediate response.  See the moment below: "

If any reader has a mind to take up golf, just watch one of the game\u2019s best players crumble out of contention in a hurry. Garc\u00eda, of Spain, came into the 15th hole at one over par while competing at Georgia\u2019s Augusta National Golf Club. In the end, he required 13 strokes for the par-5 hole, tying for the worst score ever on one hole at the tournament, ESPN noted. He hit the ball into the water five straight times at one point.   I don\u2019t know what to tell you,  he said afterward.  It\u2019s one of those things. It\u2019s the first time in my career where I make a 13 without missing a shot. Simple as that. I felt like I hit a lot of good shots and unfortunately the ball just didn\u2019t stop. It\u2019s one of those things. It\u2019s just unfortunate, but that\u2019s what it is.  What a difference a year makes. He carded a 3 on the same hole when he played it in 2017 during his march to the title, Sports Illustrated wrote. Garcia finished the day with an 81. The current leader heading into Friday\u2019s competition, Jordan Spieth, has a 66.

In the latest six-month reporting period, ending Dec. 31, Twitter permanently suspended 274,460 accounts for  violations related to the promotion of terrorism,  the company revealed in a blog post detailing highlights from its 12th biannual Twitter Transparency Report. Twitter began major suspensions of terrorist-related accounts in early 2014 in the wake of criticism that it wasn\u2019t doing enough. Last year, relatives of victims of the 2015 San Bernardino, California, terrorist attack that killed 14 people filed a federal lawsuit against Twitter, Google and Facebook, accusing the tech giants of supporting Islamic State. The suit claims the companies allowed Islamic State to build an outsized online presence to draw recruits. Twitter\u2019s latest suspension count was down 8.4 percent from 299,649 suspensions in the previous six-month reporting period and down 27 percent from the last half of 2016. Of the blocked accounts in the latest period, 93 percent were spotted by internal company tracking tools and 74 percent were cut before the first tweet appeared, Twitter reported.  Twitter credits better in-house tech tools for those declines in suspensions.  We continue to see the positive, significant impact of years of hard work making our site an undesirable place for those seeking to promote terrorism, resulting in this type of activity increasingly shifting away from Twitter,  the company said.  Government reports of violations related to terrorism represented less than 0.2 percent \u2014 597 accounts \u2014 of all suspensions in the most recent reporting period, according to Twitter. A far larger number of Twitter accounts were reported by government agencies (including police departments) for  abusive  behavior \u2014 including hate speech, racism, sexism and other types of trolling, which Twitter has been harshly criticized for failing to police. Government agencies reported 6,254 Twitter accounts in the last half of 2017 for abusive behavior, but the company took action against only a quarter of those accounts. Abusive content continues to be a particular problem for Twitter overseas, where laws more sharply restrict hate speech and trolling. A new European Commission regulation last month called on social media platforms to remove illegal content within an hour of it being reported.  In the fourth quarter of last year, Twitter reported 330 million average monthly users of its platform. "

      "text": "A woman who accused a former Mormon leader of rape filed a civil lawsuit against the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints on Wednesday, claiming the church did not properly respond when she reported the abuse decades ago. McKenna Denson, 55, says she was raped in 1984 by Joseph L. Bishop, the former president of a Mormon missionary training center (MTC) in Provo, Utah. Denson said she told local Mormon leaders about the assault numerous times over the years, but that the church failed to take action against the leader. Instead, she says, Bishop was allowed to continue holding leadership positions that placed him in charge of hundreds of Mormon youth.  Denson said that after trying to seek justice through the church for three decades, she\u2019s  absolutely prepared  to fight it in court.   I\u2019m ready for this,  Denson said Thursday during a press conference in Salt Lake City.  I\u2019ve been ready. I think what makes me feel even more confident [is], I\u2019m right. It happened. I was raped at the MTC. The church covered it up, and they still promoted him to higher and higher positions of the church.  Bishop, who is now 85 years old, denies the rape allegations. In an interview with police last year, he admitted that he had taken Denson to a small  preparation room  at the center and  asked her to show him her breasts, which she did.   Church spokesman Eric Hawkins told HuffPost in an email that the church is confident that the legal system will ensure a just result in this case.  Our hearts ache for all survivors of abuse, and the Church is committed to addressing incidents of abuse wherever they are found,  Hawkins wrote.  As this is now an active legal matter, we are unable to make further comment at this time.  In a previous statement, the church claimed that it did not impose formal discipline on Bishop because it was unable to verify the allegations against him. The church said it is investigating the alleged rape again and would take action against Bishop if it found the claims to be true. Denson\u2019s lawsuit names Bishop and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints as defendants, according to The Salt Lake Tribune. Denson\u2019s lawyer, Craig Vernon, said his client is seeking to hold Bishop accountable and that he hopes the lawsuit will also reveal systematic problems the church\u2019s handling of abuse allegations. On March 26, the church updated its guidelines on abuse prevention. The guidelines instruct church leaders to call a church helpline when they learn of possible abuse cases. The helpline reportedly connects the leaders to  legal and clinical professionals  who provide instructions on how to assist victims and comply with local requirements about reporting abuse.  Denson also brought up the church\u2019s longheld practice of allowing local leaders, known as bishops, to conduct one-on-one  worthiness  interviews with young children. Some parents have complained that bishops are able to ask children invasive questions about their sexuality during these interviews.  The interviews have recently become a controversial subject in the Mormon church. Last week, about 1,000 people marched to the church\u2019s headquarters to demand an end to the practice and make it a requirement for a parent or guardian to sit in on the interviews. The church\u2019s updated abuse guidelines make this an option, not a requirement. In response to a petition from concerned Mormon parents, Hawkins, the church spokesman, issued a statement last December defending bishops\u2019 interviews as an important part of the church\u2019s ministry.  Denson said Bishop was able to groom her for abuse because she had already gotten used to the idea that it was OK to be alone in a room with an older man who asked her sexually explicit questions. She said the movement to change the church\u2019s policies on bishop\u2019s interviews was  absolutely vital  to her.  If I had been taught early on that it was not OK to be alone, one on one with a priesthood leader, no matter how high up he is, I honestly believe this would not have happened,  she said. "

The UFC star was charged with assault and criminal mischief after he threw a hand dolly through the window of a bus transporting other fighters, police told HuffPost. The incident was caught on video: Two competitors, Michael Chiesa and Ray Borg, suffered facial or eye injuries that will keep them out of Saturday\u2019s pay-per-view event at Barclays Center in the New York City borough, the UFC said.  The organization said it withdrew another competitor from the schedule, McGregor teammate Artem Lobov, because of his alleged participation in the mayhem, forcing the cancelation of the event\u2019s third bout. A peeved McGregor showed up unexpectedly to a Barclays press event for the matches after the UFC announced it would strip him of his 155-pound title, the New York Post reported. McGregor, who lost to Floyd Mayweather Jr. in a much-hyped boxing match in August, hadn\u2019t fought in the UFC since 2016. Khabib Nurmagomedov and Max Holloway were supposed to fight for McGregor\u2019s title on Saturday but that bout was canceled as well after doctors declared Holloway  unfit to fight.  McGregor and his entourage reportedly set upon the bus with Nurmagomedov inside.  Conor went bananas and put a beating on the van that we were in looking for Khabib,  Rick Little, a coach of one of the injured fighters, told MMA Junkie.  A million security guards had to restrain him.  McGregor surrendered to police late Thursday without incident, an NYPD spokesperson said to HuffPost. UFC president Dana White said in a video that McGregor and 20 or so men also threw trash cans while the buses were pulling out of the loading docks. He called McGregor\u2019s behavior and that of his entourage  the most disgusting thing that has ever happened in the history of the company.   "

      "text": "BEIJING/WASHINGTON, April 6 (Reuters) - China warned on Friday it would fight back  at any cost  with fresh trade measures if the United States continues on its path of protectionism, hours after President Donald Trump threatened to slap tariffs on an additional $100 billion in Chinese goods. Trump said the United States has already lost any trade war, as he defended his proposed tariffs, saying the move might cause  a little pain  but the United States will be better off in the long run.  We\u2019ve already lost the trade war. We don\u2019t have a trade war, we\u2019ve lost the trade war,  Trumpsaid in a radio interview with New York radio show, 77 WABC\u2019s  Bernie & Sid  early on Friday. In a Twitter message on Wednesday, he had said:  That war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the U.S.  China\u2019s commerce ministry was due to hold a media briefing at 1200 GMT on Friday. In light of China\u2019s  unfair retaliation  against earlier U.S. trade actions, Trump upped the ante on Thursday by ordering U.S. officials to identify extra tariffs, escalating a high stakes tit-for-tat confrontation with potentially damaging consequences for the world\u2019s two biggest economies. On Wednesday, China unveiled a list of 106 U.S. goods - from soybeans and whiskey to frozen beef and aircraft - targeted for tariffs, in a swift retaliatory move only hours after the Trump administration proposed duties on some 1,300 Chinese industrial, technology, transport and medical products. Washington has called for the $50 billion in extra duties after it said a probe determined Chinese government policies are designed to transfer U.S. intellectual property to Chinese companies and allow them to seize leadership in key high-technology industries of the future. Responding to Trump\u2019s latest comments, the Chinese commerce ministry reiterated that Chinawas not afraid of a trade war even though it did not seek one, and accused the United States of provoking the conflict.  If the United States disregards the objections of China and the international community and persists in unilateralism and trade protectionism, the Chinese side will follow through to the end, at any cost, and definitely fight back resolutely,  a spokesperson was quoted as saying in a statement on the ministry\u2019s website. The ministry has called for a media briefing on Friday night, in an unusual move on a public holiday. Earlier in the day, Chinese state media had slammed Trump\u2019s threat of more trade action as  ridiculous.   This latest intimidation reflects the deep arrogance of some American elites in their attitude towards China,  the state-run Global Times said in an editorial. While Beijing\u2019s claims that Washington is the aggressor and is spurring global protectionism, China\u2019s trading partners have complained for years that it abuses World Trade Organization rules and propagates unfair policies at home that lock foreign firms out of some sectors as domestic champions are being nurtured. China has repeatedly vowed that it would open up sectors such as financial services. President Xi Jinping next week is expected to unveil fresh measures on reform and his country\u2019s opening up at the high-profile Boao Forum, China\u2019s equivalent of Davos, in the southern island province of Hainan. While China has projected an image of multilateralism and restraint amid the escalating trade dispute with the United States, Beijing has been swift to respond to Washington\u2019s rhetoric and actions. So far, U.S. information technology products from mobile phones to personal computers have largely escaped the ire of Beijing, as well as telecoms equipment and aircraft larger than the equivalent of a Boeing 737. Among the most affected by a trade war could be the U.S. technology sector, particularly chipmakers. The U.S. semiconductor sector relies on China for about a quarter of its revenue. It also remains to be seen if the trade dispute would trigger a nationalistic travel backlash. When ties between Beijing and Seoul chilled, Chinese tourism to South Korea plummeted and Made-in-South Korea products were shunned by consumers in China. On Chinese social media on Friday, among the most searched phrases were  China hasn\u2019t grown up afraid  and  China will follow through to the end.  Analysts at Oxford Economics warned that a full-blown trade war will have damaging consequences.  Importantly, these threatened tariffs will be subject to negotiation, and therefore shouldn\u2019t be considered as final,  the analysts wrote in a note to client.  A (full-blown) trade war meanwhile would have a more pronounced effect. The U.S. and Chinawould suffer significant slowdown in real GDP growth \u2013 a cumulative loss around 1.0 percentage point,  and cut global economic growth to 2.5 percent in 2019 from 3.0 percent in Oxford\u2019s baseline scenario. The escalating tit-for-tat trade actions between the two economic superpowers have roiled global financial markets, as investors worried about the impact on world trade and growth, hitting equities, the dollar and a range of riskier assets such as copper and boosting safe-havens such as the Japanese yen and gold. The dollar fell in Friday\u2019s trade, while U.S. stock futures and most of Asia\u2019s stock markets were in the red.  This is what a trade war looks like, and what we have warned against from the start,  said National Retail Federation President and CEO Matthew Shay.  We are on a dangerous downward spiral and American families will be on the losing end,  Shay added in a statement, urging Trump  to stop playing a game of chicken with the U.S. economy.

      "text": "Victoria Higgins wants you to know that she\u2019s not a jealous psychopath, she\u2019s just a writer who needed to meet a deadline. The 22-year-old Missouri State University senior writes a weekly column for The Odyssey, a website that posts blogs targeted to various colleges and universities. Last week, she was suffering writer\u2019s block until she remembered a conversation she had with a friend a week or so earlier.  A friend of mine whose boyfriend\u2019s dad died when he was in high school said she wished she could have loved and supported him when that happened,  Higgins told HuffPost.  Higgins, who is engaged to be married in May to her boyfriend Brandon, mentioned she wishes she had been able to attend prom with him back in high school.  I grew up in a small town. There was maybe a 100 people at prom,  she said.  Prom sucked.  Higgins turned that germ of an idea into a now-viral post titled,  You May Have Worn The Prom Dress With Him, But I Get To Wear The Wedding Dress.  Higgins said she wrote the post in the character of an engaged woman speaking to her fiance\u2019s high school girlfriend. This excerpt will give you a hint about the tone of the piece:  You thought that you would marry your boyfriend and you thought that everything would work out how you had always imagined. I don\u2019t blame you though. He\u2019s great. You wanted everything with him, but you were just not right for him. Higgins explains that she didn\u2019t write the piece from her direct life, but was merely putting herself in the mindset of a woman who might feel this way.  It\u2019s not directly from me,  she said.  I was trying to reach a certain group and things they can relate to.  The blog was posted Tuesday night, and Higgins says it was well received by the Missouri State University group it targeted.  But things changed after it was posted on the main Odyssey page.  People didn\u2019t understand it and it turned into hate,  she said. The article inspired a lot of criticism on Twitter: Higgins said she was unprepared for the reaction.  There\u2019s been an insane amount of cyberbullying,  she said.  If I didn\u2019t have a support system, I couldn\u2019t take it.  The worst part, she said, is how people have gone after her boyfriend.  People are messaging him saying, \u2018Run for the hills,\u2019  she said.  He\u2019s not doing good, but he knows who I am, not what the internet is saying.  Although Higgins insists the article isn\u2019t a diary from her life, she admits she may not have added enough context or explanation in her rush to make a deadline. Still, she says there are women who do relate to her blog, and they have a right to feel the way they do.  Just because someone doesn\u2019t feel the way you do, doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re psycho,  she said.  That\u2019s why I haven\u2019t taken the article down.  "

One of Edelman\u2019s Instagram followers sent him a direct message on March 25, according to the team, alerting the football player to a threatening message in the comments section of one of his posts.  Dude there is a kid in your comment section saying he s [sic] going to shoot up a school, i [sic] think you should alert the authority,  a screenshot of the comment read. Edelman contacted Moen, who found the comment posted beneath a photo Edelman had shared of himself and former teammate Danny Amendola.  I\u2019m going to shoot my school up watch the news,  the comment read, according to The New York Times. Moen contacted authorities, who responded quickly and traced the comment back to a house in Port Huron, Michigan. An article on the Patriots\u2019 website said a 14-year-old boy had confessed to police that he wrote the threat. He was taken to a juvenile detention center and charged with making a false report of a threat of terrorism. Two rifles belonging to the boy\u2019s mother were found in the home. In an interview with the Times, Edelman thanked the fan who alerted him to the threatening message. He also spoke of how the Parkland school shooting has continued to occupy his thoughts. Last month, the Patriots loaned the team\u2019s plane out to fly families of the Parkland victims, as well as students injured in the attack, from Florida to Washington, D.C., so they could attend the March For Our Lives protests. Seventeen students and educators were killed in the Feb. 14 mass shooting. "

Bahram Hojreh, 42, has been accused of sexually abusing seven of the athletes he coached at the International Water Polo Club in Los Alamitos, California, between September 2014 and January 2018, according to The Associated Press. Four of the seven girls were 15 or younger during the time the abuse allegedly took place.  The alleged abuse happened during one-on-one coaching sessions, according to court documents.  Officials told the AP that Hojreh is accused of digitally penetrating the girls, touching their breasts and genitals, and pressuring them to touch his genitals. Hojreh, who has been involved in the water polo world for over two decades, is facing more than 20 felony and misdemeanor charges including sexual battery, sexual penetration by foreign object of a minor, child annoyance and lewd acts upon a child. Hojreh\u2019s attorney, Ricardo Nico, said Wednesday during an arraignment in the Orange County Superior Court that Hojreh  adamantly denies  the allegations, the Orange County Register reported.  Christopher Ramsey, the CEO of USA Water Polo, told HuffPost that Hojreh was immediately suspended from his coaching position when the organization learned of the allegations in January. Hojreh\u2019s membership to the organization was also revoked, and he was suspended from the board of directors for the South California chapter of USA Water Polo.   USA Water Polo has zero tolerance for sexual misconduct,  Ramsey said. The allegations were initially reported to the U.S. Center for SafeSport in January. Ramsey said USA Water Polo will support the organization in its investigation efforts.  Hojreh was released on a $250,000 bond and is set to appear in court for a pretrial hearing on June 14.  Neither Hojreh nor the International Water Polo Club immediately responded to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.  Sexual abuse in Olympic and amateur sports has dominated headlines over the last few months. Former USA Gymnastics doctor and Michigan State University trainer Larry Nassar was accused of sexually abusing over 260 athletes under the guise of medical treatment. He received three concurrent sentences of 60 years, 40 to 125 years and 40 to 175 years in prison on child sexual abuse and child pornography charges. Additionally, the Southern California News Group published an explosive report in February revealing that USA Swimming has covered up hundreds of sexual abuse cases over the years. "

      "text": "USA Taekwondo coach Jean Lopez was banned from the sport on Tuesday night following multiple allegations of sexual misconduct.  Lopez, 44, is accused of sexually assaulting four female taekwondo athletes dating back to 1997, according to a report from the U.S. Center for SafeSport obtained by NPR. He had a  decades-long pattern of sexual misconduct  and allegedly used his authority as a coach to  groom, manipulate, and ultimately, sexually abuse younger female athletes,  the report states.   Given the number of incidents reported over a span of several years and by multiple reporting parties, most of whom have no reasonable motive to fabricate an allegation \u2015 much less multiple, distinct incidents \u2015 of misconduct, the totality of the circumstances clearly shows a recurrent pattern of behavior on the part of Jean,  reads another part of the report, according to USA Today.  Lopez coached the U.S. Olympic taekwondo team between 2004 and 2016, through four Olympic games. Most notably, he coached his younger brother Steven Lopez, 39, the most decorated and best-known American athlete in the sport. Steven Lopez \u2015 who won two Olympic gold medals, a bronze medal and five world championships \u2015 has separately been accused of rape by two women.  HuffPost reached out to both Jean and Steven Lopez for comment but did not immediately hear back from either. Both men have previously denied all allegations against them. Jean Lopez also trained two other younger siblings, Diana and Mark Lopez, who competed on the Olympic level as well.  The former coach was declared  permanently ineligible  as of April 3, according to SafeSport\u2019s website. Permanently ineligible is defined by SafeSport as  permanently prohibited from participating in any capacity in any activity or competition authorized by, organized by, or under the auspices of the United States Olympic Committee, the national governing bodies recognized by the USOC, and/or a Local Affiliated Organization of a national governing body recognized by the USOC.   A spokesperson for SafeSport declined to comment further on Lopez\u2019s ineligibility.  Heidi Gilbert, a former taekwondo fighter who trained under Lopez, told NPR that he had sexually assaulted her after she won a gold medal in the Pan American Games in Ecuador in 2002, when she was 19. Gilbert said Lopez drugged and assaulted her again a year later while the two were in Germany for the World Championships.   I am relieved and excited that he will no longer be able to coach young athletes or manipulate girls in these kinds of settings,  Gilbert told USA Today, adding that she\u2019s still  highly disappointed  that the process took so long to penalize Lopez.  Another elite taekwondo fighter, Mandy Meloon, filed a formal complaint against Lopez with USA Taekwondo in 2006. According to Meloon, Lopez inappropriately touched her in 1997 when she was underage while the two were traveling internationally for a competition. Meloon was also in a long-term relationship with Steven Lopez and claims that he physically abused and raped her multiple times. USA Taekwondo opened an investigation into the sexual assault allegations against Jean and Steven Lopez three years ago, but little was done. Both brothers were allowed to participate in the 2016 Rio Olympics. It wasn\u2019t until the two cases were handed over to the U.S. Center for SafeSport in March of last year that action was taken. SafeSport declined to comment on the current status of Steven Lopez\u2019s case, according to NPR. Steve McNally, the executive director of USA Taekwondo, declined to comment about the allegations against Jean Lopez. He told HuffPost,  Unfortunately we can\u2019t comment beyond what\u2019s been published on our suspension list at this time. As the decision is still subject to appeal it would be inappropriate to comment further until due process is concluded.  The U.S. Center for SafeSport was created in 2017 to investigate all sexual abuse complaints in amateur Olympic sports organizations. The nonprofit center was launched in response to the Larry Nassar scandal in the gymnastics world and various other systemic issues of sexual abuse in Olympic sports.  "

      "text": "Women in China are covertly resisting government crackdowns on discussions over their Me Too movement with a clever workaround. The phrase  rice bunny  (\u7c73\u5154), pronounced as  mi tu,  has popped up on social media networks after censors removed posts that mentioned sexual harassment or the hashtag #MeToo. While those phrases are heavily monitored, Rice Bunny isn\u2019t. In addition to the rice and bunny emojis, social media users also use the phrase in popular hashtags #\u7c73\u5154\u4e0d\u80fd\u5fd8# ( Rice Bunny Never Forget ) and #\u7c73\u5154\u5728\u4e2d\u56fd# ( Rice Bunny In China ). Social media users have used them in campaigns, forums and various accounts on platforms like Weibo and WeChat to discuss topics such as opportunity inequality, domestic violence and sexual harassment. The new phrase is harder for censors to follow, as  rice  and  bunny  are both common enough words that banning them from a platform would be too difficult. One recent post on Weibo that uses the hashtags calls on others to stand up to gender inequality, fight discrimination and violence, and criticizes the censoring of feminist messages, according to a HuffPost translation. Another post shows a woman holding a sign that reads,  The fight against sexual harassment is far more important than shopping.  The feminist movement in China experienced a resurgence in the past few years, particularly among the younger generations, oftentimes drawing influence from Western countries. But the rise of feminism has amplified the country\u2019s complicated relationship with gender equality.  Women in China, particularly from urban areas, have seen considerable job mobility in recent decades in certain industries like tech. Almost 80 percent of companies have women in top positions, according to The Atlantic. To compare, about half of U.S. tech companies employ women in such spots. And in December 2015, the country passed its first legislation against domestic violence \u2015 a landmark law for China. But much like the slew of other social and political movements, like the 2014 Umbrella Revolution and the pro-democracy protests of 2011, feminism has been met with resistance from the government. In one of the most high-profile cases, Beijing police arrested and detained five gender equality activists, known as the  Feminist Five,  in 2015 for planning to stage protests against sexual harassment.  The #MeToo movement in China was largely inspired by Luo Xixi, a former student who shared an online essay describing being sexually assaulted by Chen Xiaowu, a professor at Beihang University. Chen was quickly fired after Luo\u2019s piece went viral and an investigation found he\u2019d had a history of sexual harassment. Her piece prompted lengthy debates about sexual harassment on Weibo and other online platforms. Since then, however, popular Weibo accounts #MeToo and Feminist Voices have been suspended several times due to their criticism of gender inequality in Chinese society. Profiles and hashtags on Chinese social media continue to be monitored and frequently taken down. Yet with the shutdown of each profile, new ones under different monikers are launched. The creative Rice Bunny hashtags are just another example of the resilience inside China\u2019s feminist movement.   Chinese women feel very unequal every day of their lives, and the government cannot make women oblivious to the deep injustice they feel,  Lu Pin, the founding editor of Feminist Voices, told NPR after the account was put on a 30-day ban.  The feminist movement is about building a community to address women\u2019s everyday concerns.  In the past, activists have used wordplay to both avoid China\u2019s censorship and even criticize it. In 2009, social media users used  grass-mud horse  \u2015 a phrase that\u2019s pronounced similarly to the Chinese words for  fuck your mother  \u2015 to convey opposition to internet censorship.  River crab,  which is pronounced similarly to the Chinese phrase for harmony, became a euphemism for censorship itself. Online users who\u2019d been censored could tell others that their posts had been  harmonized.  John Zhou helped with translations for this post.  "

      "text": "Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wants you to know he\u2019s super sorry. And for the most part it really does seem like he means it \u2015 so long as apologizing and trying to earn back users\u2019 trust doesn\u2019t cut into company profits. On Wednesday afternoon, the social media company made its founder available for questions from the media shortly after it announced plans to restrict who can access user data and to clarify how it uses that data in the first place. At the same time, Facebook also increased its estimate of users whose data was harvested and shared with the political research firm Cambridge Analytica, from 50 million to as many as 87 million. Needless to say, there was plenty to talk about. Here\u2019s a brief rundown of the bigger points of the conversation: Zuckerberg said he expects the company will revise and reassess the extent of Russia\u2019s misinformation campaign and that its numbers will undoubtedly grow.  There is going to be more content that we\u2019re going to find over time,  he said.  As long as there are people employed in Russia who have the job of trying to find a way to exploit these systems, this is going to be a never-ending battle. You never fully solve security; it\u2019s an arms race.  He acknowledged Facebook was  behind  during the 2016 election and said the company plans to hire 20,000 people by the end of the year to focus on content screening and security efforts. There hasn\u2019t been any  meaningful impact  by the movement, he said, but the company does take seriously the underlying sentiment that\u2019s driving it.  Even if we can\u2019t measure a change, it still speaks to people feeling like this is a massive breach of trust.   Facebook took Cambridge Analytica at its word that the company had, in fact, deleted the data harvested from up to 87 million users \u2015 and maybe it should have followed up to verify it was actually deleted. Zuckerberg didn\u2019t rule out the possibility of legal action against Cambridge Analytica but said Facebook will do a full audit first to determine what happened to the data and when. That said, he acknowledged Facebook can\u2019t just pass the blame onto Cambridge Analytica, as Facebook\u2019s tools enabled its behavior in the first place.  I think we understand that we need to take a broader view of our responsibility,  Zuckerberg said.  We\u2019re not just building tools, but we need to take full responsibility for the outcomes of how people use those tools as well.   Knowing what I know today, clearly we should\u2019ve done more, and we will going forward.  He\u2019s into it, with some reservations. Asked specifically if he\u2019d be willing to implement new privacy policies in the U.S. similar to the strict new privacy laws rolling out in the European Union, Zuckerberg said he was comfortable with the idea but not in the same format. When the EU law takes effect on May 25, Facebook will have to get users\u2019 explicit consent to collect data and be much more upfront about how it uses that data. Zuckerberg said Facebook  intends to make the same controls and settings available everywhere, not just in Europe.  That\u2019s subject to some flexibility, however \u2015 a variation he attributed to a patchwork of global laws on the matter. Two reporters asked variations of this question, and it seemingly caught him off guard the first time. The second time he unhesitatingly said yes, portraying the company\u2019s recent stumbles more as learning opportunities than far-reaching mistakes.  When you\u2019re building something like Facebook that is unprecedented in the world, there are going to be things that you mess up. And if we\u2019d gotten this right, we would\u2019ve messed something else up. I don\u2019t think anyone is going to be perfect. But I think what people should hold us accountable for is learning from the mistakes and continually doing better and continuing to evolve what our view of our responsibility is.  Nope. Zuckerberg disputed the premise of the question, portraying a more profitable Facebook as one that\u2019s fundamentally more useful to people. As the site gets better at targeting users with more-relevant ads, the more profitable it will be.  People tell us that if they\u2019re going to see ads, they want the ads to be good. Like most of the hard decisions we have to make, this is one where there\u2019s a trade-off between values that people care about. On the one hand, people want relevant experiences, and on the other hand, I do think there\u2019s some discomfort with how data is used in systems like ads. But I think the feedback is overwhelmingly on the side of wanting a better experience.  Zuckerberg broke this into three distinct categories, each to be combated via different initiatives by the company. The first category of bad actors he summed up as spammers who craft sensationalistic fake stories. People click, the stories spread rapidly despite being false and the author \u2015 often located in Macedonia \u2015 makes money. Simple artificial intelligence measures have helped curb this type of economically driven content. The second category belongs to Russian agents and other government actors who are interfering with and attempting to influence the outcome of an election. Zuckerberg acknowledged this is more difficult to combat \u2015 especially because it mimics and can be indistinguishable from legitimate political discussion. Facebook is making progress here, with moderate successes in the French and German elections, but Zuckerberg cautioned it will be a  multi-year effort.  And the third category he identified tracks back to political polarization in society itself. That shows up on Facebook when highly biased media outlets present a larger picture that  isn\u2019t really true even if the specific facts might be.  Zuckerberg said the site is seeking to counter by promoting  broadly trusted journalism  that does a  fair and thorough  job. "

Donte DiVincenzo came off the bench to pour in a game-high 31 points and lead the Wildcats their second NCAA Tournament championship in three seasons, a workmanlike 79-62 beating of Michigan at the Alamodome in San Antonio. Mikal Bridges added 19 for Villanova, which overcame an early deficit with a late first-half run fueled by DiVincenzo before pulling away in the second half behind more balanced contributions and its underrated defense. The Wildcats (36-4) became the first team since North Carolina in 2015 to lead the country in scoring and win the national title. The 2009 Tar Heels were the last team to win every tourney game by double digits. Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman scored 23 points for the Wolverines (33-8) and Moritz Wagner hit for 16, but they didn\u2019t have enough help. Michigan made just 43.6 percent of its field-goal tries and went a paltry 3 of 23 from the 3-point arc. After Wagner scored the first bucket of the second half, the Wildcats left no doubt about their superiority. They went on a 14-3 run that Bridges capped with a 3-pointer for a 51-33 advantage with 14:36 remaining. The lead never dipped below 12 for the game\u2019s remainder as Villanova answered every little Wolverines run with a bucket here, a couple of 3-pointers there. DiVincenzo rattled off nine consecutive points in a 2:39 span, giving the Wildcats a 62-44 cushion with 7:57 left. Michigan rode Wagner and Abdur-Rahkman to an early lead. The senior duo scored the team\u2019s first 16 points \u2015 Wagner had nine \u2015 as the Wolverines opened a 16-11 cushion at the 12:26 mark of the first half when Abdur-Rahkman drove for a layup. Meanwhile, Villanova found during the first 12 minutes that it wasn\u2019t going to solve Michigan\u2019s defense as easily as it did Kansas\u2019 on Saturday night. The Wildcats, who made a Final Four-record 18 3-pointers in routing the Jayhawks, missed eight of their first nine long-distance attempts Monday. However, Villanova found something that worked. DiVincenzo shot the Wildcats into the lead with an all-out assault, hitting 3-pointers while also driving for buckets. He scored 10 consecutive points for the Wildcats in a 2:55 span late in the half, enabling Villanova to end the half on a 23-7 run that gave them a 37-28 halftime advantage. The Wildcats\u2019 win follows the Eagles\u2019 Super Bowl triumph, making Philadelphia the first city ever to win the Super Bowl championship and the NCAA championship in the same year, according to TBS.

During a recent episode of David Axelrod\u2019s podcast,  The Axe Files,  Phelps opened up about his depression, and blamed the U.S. Olympic Committee for failing to help athletes transition from the grueling demands of training and competition to the letdown that inevitably follows.   The USOC, in my opinion, hasn\u2019t done anything to help us transition after an Olympics,  said Phelps, who estimated that roughly 90 percent of athletes experience post-games depression.

The U.S. Olympic Committee didn\u2019t immediately answer a request for comment. USOC offers what it calls the pivot program to help  retiring athletes in their health and well-being as whole people beyond athletics by providing tools, techniques and a support system to discover and cultivate their next passions and goals as they transition out of elite competition.  The goal is to facilitate athletes\u2019 transition into the  real world.  Phelps said he went to rehab in Arizona after his second DUI arrest. He said he hoped the USOC will do more to help other athletes.  Current and former athletes like Olympic swimmer Missy Franklin and NBA star Kevin Love also have publicly discussed their mental health struggles. U.S. senators have called for a probe of the USOC after former USA Gymastics team doctor Larry Nassar\u2019s sexual assault convictions involving young athletes, including Olympians.   We\u2019re competing to represent our country. We\u2019re competing to do everything we can to try to win a medal or to try to do our country proud by wearing the stars and stripes on international ground,  said Phelps.  When we come home from it, you know, they\u2019re like, kind of, \u2018Okay, check. Who\u2019s the next kid coming in? Where\u2019s the next person?\u2019 And I think it\u2019s sad.

      "text": "Amateurism is beaten and bloodied. Still it stands.  Andy Schwarz and Ricky Volante want to deliver the coup de gr\u00e2ce.  Michigan and Villanova are playing tonight for the NCAA\u2019s men\u2019s college basketball championship. A lot of people will make money off this game, and none of them will be anyone who played in it. The NCAA, the television networks, the universities, the coaches and corporate sponsors \u2014 they\u2019ll all get some piece of the millions of dollars raked in annually by the tournament. The actual attraction, the players on the court, won\u2019t receive a dime. Over the last five years, the NCAA  amateurism  model that keeps players from truly sharing in the massive amount of money they create has faced significant challenges. Former UCLA basketball player Ed O\u2019Bannon sued the NCAA in 2009 over the use of college athletes\u2019 names, images and likenesses in video games and won a victory in federal court. Members of Northwestern University\u2019s football squad fought for and won the right to form the first players\u2019 union in college sports history. But each time, the celebrations that accompanied those victories proved premature: A key provision of the O\u2019Bannon ruling that would\u2019ve lifted the NCAA\u2019s ban on compensation was tossed out on appeal; the National Labor Relations Board ruled that Northwestern\u2019s players couldn\u2019t, in fact, form a union.  In 2017, Schwarz, an economist and frequent critic of the NCAA, and Volante, a lawyer, announced the creation of the Historical Basketball League, an alternative to the NCAA that would pay the players on teams at historically black colleges and universities, or HBCUs.  The HBL hasn\u2019t launched yet, but the proposal arrives at an important juncture in the war on the NCAA. Last fall, word came down of an FBI investigation into how major college basketball programs managed to pay their best players, a dubious and destructive exercise in federalizing the NCAA rulebook. The likely immediate outcome will be an entrenchment of the NCAA\u2019s power to police its amateurism ideal, what with the G-Men now working in concert with the governing body\u2019s rent-a-cops.  But other effects likely will be less friendly to the NCAA. For one thing, the possibility of federal criminal charges will surely change the risk calculus for people connected to the bootleg economy of big-time college sports \u2014 the assistant coaches, the sneaker company reps, the bagmen. At some point, you figure, they\u2019re going to start looking for alternatives to the current model. Into this uncertain moment comes the HBL. The proposal is an extension of the argument against the NCAA being heard in the courts and from certain corners of the media. The HBL wants to test the notion, frequently offered by NCAA dead-enders, that people will stop caring about college sports if the athletes are compensated in something other than company scrip. And the league\u2019s focus on black colleges is a reminder that the NCAA\u2019s ruinous attachment to the amateurism ideal creates racist outcomes in which revenue generated by black athletes is redistributed among predominantly white coaches, white administrators, white executives. But Schwarz and Volante want to do more than just mount an argument; they\u2019re trying to build a real basketball league. Last week, HuffPost sat down with them to talk about their proposal, how it would work and who has expressed interest thus far. The following is a transcript of the discussion, edited for length and clarity. HuffPost: What exactly is the HBL? Schwarz: The HBL, it stands for Historical Basketball League, and the  H  is doing double-duty. One is because we\u2019re going to be partnering with historically black colleges and universities. The other thing is, in the formative years of college sports, there were no NCAA rules against pay, and many of those athletes were paid. So we\u2019re returning college basketball to the historic roots of college sports played by college students, but by paid college students. We are a professional college sports league. All of our athletes will be full-time students at HBCUs. Our season is in the summer to make sure it minimizes the conflict between athletics and academics.  The idea here is to essentially put on a great college basketball program, played at great colleges with deep history, with three future NBA or European basketball stars on the court playing each other. The only thing that\u2019s going to be different from what people are used to is that the athletes will be sharing. It\u2019ll be like fair trade basketball \u2015 the workers will be getting a fair share of the revenue that we\u2019re generating. HuffPost: How did the idea come about? Schwarz: So, the two precipitating events were our success \u2015 and I say our because I worked on the case \u2015 in the O\u2019Bannon case, where a judge found that what the NCAA does when it sets a maximum scholarship is price-fixing, and the success of the unionization effort at Northwestern, where a local administrator acknowledged that the duties of a college football player met the definition of an employee under federal labor law. And then the consequent rollback by appeals courts of both of those decisions.  It felt like years of effort to get real change and succeeding and convincing two finders of fact and law were gone in a heartbeat because of older, less-informed people one step up the chain. It was frustrating.  So, if you can\u2019t unionize and you can\u2019t sue them, the other way to beat a cartel is to out-compete them. And the idea here is that by depressing the salary of college athletes, you create an opportunity for entry. Sort of like how by being a horrible taxi company, you create the ability for Lyft or Uber to start grabbing customers. It\u2019s the same thing here, and what we want to do is effectively force the industry to recognize the value of the talent by paying them more. Either they will compete with us, or they won\u2019t.  Volante: Our mission has three different prongs: First and foremost, to create a sports economy that the athletes actually get to participate in. Number two is empowering these schools that historically have considerable significance, especially in the South. And number three is disrupting the concept of amateurism and proving that the concept of amateurism isn\u2019t necessary for college sports to be successful, and furthermore, that amateurism is not necessary for people to tune in and watch, as the NCAA repeatedly claims.  HuffPost: Is this a real plan with a chance to come to fruition, or is it an effort to say,  This is possible for the NCAA to do ? Volante: This is definitely a real plan. We already have several investors from Silicon Valley. We have an investor from the New York tech community. They certainly see the value from a monetization standpoint.  For me, this is a full-time job. We have a team. We have at least 30 people across the country that contribute in some way, shape or form. We have Keith Sparks, who is our chief development officer and was formerly an associate athletic director at Stanford University. And he was able to bring us our CMO, Ralph Greene, who used to head Nike Football and also started Nike Basketball\u2019s international pipeline. This is absolutely a real thing. HuffPost: Why HBCUs? What makes, say, Howard or Grambling the right place to do this? Schwarz: The schools within the NCAA cartel who are getting the short end of the deal are the HBCUs. A Division I HBCU gets less than a million dollars from the NCAA and its conference combined. A [Southeastern Conference] school can get over $40 million. That\u2019s a huge disparity. So what they are getting for the exploitation of black labor is a small amount. And they are, of the people receiving some of these profits, the ones that most recognize that a system in which black labor was more valued would be mission-consistent with their raison d\u2019etre, in a way that some other small schools might think about but not care about. That\u2019s my theory. Volante: Beyond the economic piece of it, historically, these universities have been involved in a number of selfless efforts to offer educational opportunities and further the economic opportunities for African Americans as a whole. A lot of these schools started right after the Civil War during the Reconstruction Era, so there\u2019s the opportunity there that taking these brands which are very strong within the HBCU community and the African-American community and breathing new life into them and showing to the rest of the U.S. how great of institutions they truly are, and how well they prepare individuals for life after college, whether they\u2019re an athlete or not. We think there\u2019s significant upside for the schools to get involved, but also significant upside for these players to go onto campuses where they will be welcomed with open arms and there will be a holistic approach to preparing for life after basketball, or getting all the tools they need to go to the NBA.    HuffPost: Do you worry about the perception of white guys creating a business model that\u2019s, for lack of a better word, experimenting on HBCUs and black athletes? Schwarz: I know people are wary about it because that\u2019s almost always the first question that Ricky and I get when we go in and talk to university presidents. There\u2019s a suspicion of a carpetbagger coming in here and feeding us a line. The good news is, if you go to our website and look at the seven or so people who are really leading the charge here, it\u2019s not a majority white organization at this point. It was my idea, Ricky wrote the original business plan, but we have expanded so that some of that problem has gone away. And when we go to these meetings, generally we\u2019re a mixed group. I think it\u2019s a perfectly valid question to ask:  Why do I care about HBCUs? Isn\u2019t this just me trying to prove a point?  But I hope that anybody who goes to our website thinks about who\u2019s investing in us \u2015 we have an important executive in Silicon Valley who is black and is involved with programs connecting the tech community with HBCUs, we have people who\u2019ve done their Ph.D.\u2019s on the experience of black athletes at predominately white institutions.  HuffPost: Time for the classic question: Where does the money come from to pay these guys, and how much would they make? Volante: We are not asking for a single dime from any school that\u2019s participating in this. The way the plan\u2019s been structured ... it\u2019s club teams on these campuses. That\u2019s done with the sole purpose in mind of protecting the universities. It\u2019s not a fork in the road. It\u2019s not, I turn right and stay with the NCAA, I turn left and go with HBL. This is very much a parallel path that we are going to be operating this club team on the campuses of these HBCUs and the varsity teams will continue to exist. They\u2019ll still get their distributions from the NCAA for March Madness every year. This is complementary revenue, not replacement revenue. The salaries and all the costs of the league are going to be covered initially by private investors. It will shift at a point, hopefully within the first season or two, that our revenues will cover any and all costs and there will be excess left over to not only provide additional payments and grow the salaries of our players, but also ensure that the financial incentive is there for the schools to want to continue to participate. As to determining who gets paid what, much like in professional basketball, it will be driven by talent. Right now, the salaries will range from $50,000 to $100,000 per season. But that\u2019s just a piece of what they get. If you\u2019re Zion Williamson you\u2019re going to get the maximum amount because you\u2019re an elite talent. If you\u2019re a guy who\u2019s a very good basketball player but doesn\u2019t have NBA potential, in that first season he might get $50,000 with the opportunity to grow his salary. The salary is determined year to year.  Schwarz: But to be clear, the scholarship piece is completely unconditional on quality of play. You get a five-year scholarship even if you go to the NBA after one season \u2014 you can come back and use that scholarship.  HuffPost: So you\u2019re guaranteeing a full scholarship plus at least $50,000 a year?  Volante: The thing that gets the headlines is the compensation. Number two is the five-year guaranteed scholarship. Number three is where we start to get into the fringe benefits that any other employee at any place has: having a 401(k) set up, having an appropriate insurance plan, so these guys are going to be protected for injury. We\u2019re going to help them monetize their social media accounts. So a player might walk out of college with a degree \u2015 a real degree \u2015 and also with savings that might be $300,000 to $500,000 or more. HuffPost: Who are you targeting on the recruiting trail? The one-and-dones superstars of the world, or more of the mid-tier college basketball player whose NBA hopes are a little less real? Volante: The shortest answer is both. We want all of them. Schwarz: It\u2019s not just a one-and-done. For that very next tier of folks who are really the bread and butter of what makes March Madness exciting to people \u2015 we want to get that player. And we think, there, [that] the contrast in earnings is the greatest, between what that guy will earn maybe playing in the G-League for a couple years, or playing in Australia or wherever, and losing out on not just the best four years of his earnings but maybe the best six years of his earnings. We think our package is really superior in that spot. HuffPost: What\u2019s been the level of interest from the HBCUs? Volante: We\u2019ve spoken with between 12 and 15, including some of the biggest ones out there. We have a couple of schools that have told us that they would like to be involved, they would like to participate, however they do not want to be the first school to say yes. So finding that first-mover has definitely proven challenging for us.  HuffPost: There are 102 HBCUs across the United States. Are you trying to get all of them to join? Volante: No. There\u2019s a reason why, at least in the U.S., every sports league ends up hovering between 20 and 35 or so teams. Once you go beyond that, the overall cost of a single-entity operation becomes a net-negative as opposed to finding that optimal place. We\u2019re hoping to reach that within five seasons. But the actual profile of the schools we\u2019re trying to get falls into three buckets. Bucket one is an HBCU that you generally know, even the average person, so a Howard or a Hampton. [Number two is] schools that once upon a time, pre-desegregation, were athletic powerhouses, so examples there would be like Florida A&M or Texas Southern. And number three would be smaller institutions that unless you\u2019re in that niche community you probably wouldn\u2019t know, but the school is situated in a major metropolitan area. An example might be Xavier in New Orleans or Fisk in Nashville.  In year one, we want 12 or 16. Once we hit 12, the green light goes, we start recruiting players rapidly, and ramping things up. Schwarz: I think the audience is ready for it. People your age, people Ricky\u2019s age, are ready for it sooner than it feels like legislators would be ready for it. This is a situation where maybe democracy is lagging behind capitalism, in some sense. We don\u2019t need every person in America to tune into our product to be successful. We just need a solid fan base that can cover the cost of a solid league, and we can grow from there. The idea that if some college programs paid their athletes, college sports will die is so silly. And we, among other things, are going to prove that. HuffPost: Has the FBI investigation into college basketball changed your calculus? It seems to me that, say, an Adidas executive or an AAU coach might look around and say,  Why participate in a system that could get me thrown in jail, if there\u2019s another league where all this is legal?  Volante: That\u2019s part of the pitch, at least to certain audiences.  Apparel company conversations have started. Adidas and some of the other bigger ones are going to be forced to change their business model soon if this DOJ investigation really does result in people going to prison. Because otherwise every time you send a representative out, you risk them being arrested. Those companies, sooner rather than later, are going to have to realize that either they continue going down the path they\u2019re on with the NCAA, and don\u2019t change the model and risk people and their lives \u2015 or they align themselves with a model that doesn\u2019t care, that realizes what they\u2019re doing are everyday business practices in every other industry. So Adidas and Nike are primary targets of ours, but they\u2019re certainly not the only ones out there. Schwarz: One of the things we\u2019re offering our athletes is that they can make their own shoe deal.  Volante: What has been the end goal of Adidas\u2019 business model? It\u2019s to eventually have those elite players who have gone to Louisville and other schools, that once they go to the NBA, they\u2019re wearing Adidas shoes. Here you don\u2019t have to have all those intermediate steps. Adidas or Nike can sign those players while they\u2019re in the HBL, and they already have their shoe deal, and those companies can start building their brand around these guys. There\u2019s a lot of potential value here, to Adidas or Nike or whatever company, to the players, and the schools will be getting the benefit the entire time. If the next Zion Williamson is playing for Grambling or Hampton or Howard, that school is going to constantly be in the forefront of peoples\u2019 minds when they\u2019re watching college basketball. You\u2019re not going to think about Duke or Kentucky. You\u2019re going to think about them. HuffPost: So when\u2019s the first game? Volante: There are a ton of chicken-and-egg things going on. Every group of stakeholders is looking at each other and saying,  Are you in? Are you in? Are you in?  However, we are starting to break through those. We\u2019ve been most successful on the investment front, and when you have more money, you\u2019re able to do more things. So I think we\u2019ll be able to ramp up our school recruitment effort significantly in the next couple months. And I would say realistically, the HBL\u2019s inaugural season will tip off on Juneteenth 2020. "

Clark of the Tacoma News Tribune shows the children at Safeco Field kneeling alongside their standing classmates from Seattle\u2019s Mount View Elementary School. Colin Kaepernick retweeted the picture. There was video, too. The apparent protest before the Mariners played the Cleveland Indians follows more than a year of controversy. Athletes have been kneeling during the anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. A spokeswoman for Seattle\u2019s Highline Public Schools called it an  individual act by the students.   Obviously, the school district respects the First Amendment rights of our students,  Catherine Carbone Rogers told HuffPost. Kaepernick began the practice of  taking a knee  during  The Star-Spangled Banner  as a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers. The movement spread to other players and NFL teams \u2015 and even eventually to members of youth teams. President Donald Trump has repeatedly objected to the on-field activism.  On Sunday, the sight of young performers kneeling during the anthem \u2015 and in front of the presentation of flags \u2015 at an MLB game predictably divided Twitter users. While many had praise, others speculated the kids\u2019 parents were behind the demonstration. Some sports outlets applauded the move.  The two young girls who kneeled during their performance at Sunday\u2019s Mariners game are trailblazers, demonstrating that the quest for racial equality and social justice has support from a new generation,  Yahoo Sports wrote. USA Today\u2019s For The Win said:  Kids these days are not going to accept being spectators for important discussions regarding the communities in which they live. The future is in good hands.  "

      "text": "By Jim Finkle and David Henry TORONTO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Retailer Hudson\u2019s Bay Co on Sunday disclosed that it was the victim of a security breach that compromised data on payment cards used at Saks and Lord & Taylor stores in North America. One cyber security firm said that it has evidence that millions of cards may have been compromised, which would make the breach one of the largest involving payment cards over the past year, but added that it was too soon to confirm whether that was the case. Toronto-based Hudson\u2019s Bay said in a statement that it had  taken steps to contain  the breach but did not say it had succeeded in confirming that its network was secure. It also did not say when the breach had begun or how many payment card numbers were taken.  Once we have more clarity around the facts, we will notify our customers quickly and will offer those impacted free identity protection services, including credit and web monitoring,  the statement said. A company spokeswoman declined to elaborate. The breach comes as Hudson\u2019s Bay struggles to improve its financial performance as a tough retail environment has weighed on sales and margins. Last June, it launched a transformation plan to cut costs and is working to monetize the value of its substantial real estate holdings. Hudson\u2019s Bay disclosed the incident after New York-based cyber security firm Gemini Advisory reported on its blog that Saks and Lord & Taylor had been hacked by a well-known criminal group known as JokerStash. JokerStash, which sells stolen data on the criminal underground, on Wednesday said that it planned to release more than 5 million stolen credit cards, according to Gemini Chief Technology Officer Dmitry Chorine. The hacking group has so far released about 125,000 payment cards, about 75 percent of which appear to have been taken from the Hudson\u2019s Bay units, Chorine told Reuters by telephone. The bulk of the 5 million card numbers that JokerStash said it plans to release are likely from Saks and Lord & Taylor, but it is too early to say for sure, Chorine said.  It\u2019s hard to assess at the moment, primarily because hackers have not released the entire cards in one batch,  he told Reuters. Alex Holden, chief information security officer with cyber security firm Hold Security, confirmed that the 125,000 cards had been released by JokerStash but said it was too soon to estimate how many had been taken from Hudson\u2019s Bay. If in fact millions of records were stolen, the breach would be one of the largest involving payment cards in the past year, but it would still be far smaller than any of the biggest thefts on record, which occurred a decade ago. Hackers stole more than 130 million credit cards from credit-card processor Heartland Payment Systems, convenience store operator 7-Eleven Inc and grocer Hannaford Brothers Co, from 2006 to 2008, according to U.S. federal investigators. Cyber criminals stole some 40 million payment cards in a 2013 hack on Target Corp and 56 million from Home Depot Inc in 2014. Hudson\u2019s Bay said there is no indication its recent breach involved online sales at Saks and Lord& Taylor outlets or its Hudson\u2019s Bay, Home Outfitters and HBC Europe units. The company said that customers will not be liable for fraudulent charges resulting from the breach.

But here we are. President Donald Trump on Friday proclaimed that April was National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month, and the irony was lost on no one.  Sexual assault crimes remain tragically common in our society,  the president\u2019s proclamation read.  And offenders too often evade accountability.  At least 19 women have accused Trump of sexual harassment or misconduct. He has yet to be charged and refuses to resign as president, despite lawsuits against him and his own comments about women. In the wake of the powerful Women\u2019s March and amid the momentum of the Me Too movement, any effort to address sexual assault prevention is crucial. But while some of the most powerful men in the country have been knocked from their positions while facing accusations \u2015 including disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein, TV host Matt Lauer and former Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) \u2015 Trump has remained noticeably untouched. Throughout his career as a real estate mogul and reality TV star, Trump has faced several sexual assault lawsuits. Summer Zervos, a former contestant on  The Apprentice,  claims that Trump aggressively kissed her and placed his hand on her breast after she asked him about potential job opportunities in 2007. She filed a defamation lawsuit against Trump after he called her allegations a  hoax.   In 1997, Jill Harth filed a lawsuit claiming that Trump had made unwanted advances toward her, harassed her and repeatedly groped her under a table during dinner. Harth eventually dropped the lawsuit but continues to stand by her story. Many other women have come forward with their accusations against Trump, with incidents ranging from sexually explicit comments to nonconsensual kisses and groping. Trump himself has even admitted to making sexual advances on women without their permission in a shocking audio recording from 2005.   When you\u2019re a star, they let you do it,  Trump told  Access Hollywood  host Billy Bush in the recording.  You can do anything.   Grab them by the pussy,  he added.  You can do anything.  In December, a group of Trump\u2019s accusers held a press conference to urge Congress to investigate their claims. The women shared their accounts of Trump\u2019s actions and explained how it felt to watch a man who had allegedly violated them be elected president after they came forward with their claims.  It was heartbreaking last year when we all \u2014 we\u2019re private citizens \u2014 for us to put ourselves out there to try to show America who this man is and especially how he views women and for them to say, \u2018Meh, we don\u2019t care,\u2019  one of the accusers, Samantha Holvey, said.  It hurt.   After Trump\u2019s National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month proclamation was announced Friday, people turned to their Twitter feeds to point out the obvious. "

      "text": "An international health organization has suspended its partnership with the Heineken beer company because of the controversial use of so-called  beer girls  to promote its products. The Global Fund launched a partnership in January with the Dutch brewer in its latest campaign to battle AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in Africa. Heineken was to use its communications and logistics expertise to help shape effective messages, identify demand and provide quality control in shipments of medical supplies, according to a Heineken statement. But the Global Fund announced on Thursday in a statement that it was suspending its partnership with Heineken  based on recent reports of the company\u2019s use of female beer promoters in ways that expose them to sexual exploitation and health risks,  National Public Radio reported.  We take these allegations very seriously and have challenged Heineken to examine their operations and make changes to protect women from sexual exploitation and health risks,  said Global Fund executive director Peter Sands.  We are suspending the partnership until such time as Heineken can take appropriate action to address these issues.  The mostly young drink promoters are paid low wages \u2014 and work for tips, largely from groups of intoxicated men \u2014 to push certain beers in bars. Heineken has come under particular pressure to end the practice in Southeast Asia, especially Cambodia. A 2011 study found that some Heineken beer girls in Cambodian bars moonlighted as sex workers for extra money and faced increased risks of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. Reporter Olivier van Beemen revealed a similar situation in West African bars in an article in the Dutch publication NRC last week. That was apparently what Sands was referencing when he said  recent reports.  Heineken could not immediately be reached for comment. The company, however, responded to van Beemen\u2019s article, saying it took drink promoters\u2019 risk of sexual exploitation very seriously.   The practices described go completely against what we stand for as a company, and therefore we strongly condemn these malpractices,  said the Heineken statement.  The beer promoters are not employed by Heineken, but are sourced via external agencies ... this makes it difficult to properly supervise the working conditions. However, we simply cannot allow them to continue to be confronted with unwanted intimacies and abuse or even with prostitution during their work.  The company\u2019s statement concluded:  We will take further steps together with our local operating companies, promotional agencies and other relevant parties to deal with these malpractices and prevent them in the future.  Critics had earlier condemned Global Fund\u2019s partnership with Heineken, saying an organization concerned with health should not work with a company pushing alcohol, which can be detrimental to health. It\u2019s been a bad month for Heineken. Earlier this week, the company yanked a beer commercial that Chance the Rapper criticized as  terribly racist.  The Heineken Light ad showed a bartender sliding a bottle along a bar, past several black people, to a fair-skinned woman as the tagline,  Sometimes, lighter is better,  flashed on the screen.  We missed the mark, are taking the feedback to heart and will use this to influence future campaigns,  a Heineken spokesperson told Newsweek. The Global Fund is an international organization headquartered in Geneva that\u2019s the largest funder of programs to battle AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria in the world. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation provided seed money for the organization that began in 2002, according to Agence France Presse. "

      "text": "Scott Foster had some story to tell around the office water cooler on Friday. The 36-year-old accountant and beer-league hockey player filled in as an emergency goalie in his NHL debut, helping the Chicago Blackhawks to a 6-2 victory over the visiting Winnipeg Jets Thursday night. After two goaltenders on the Blackhawks roster went down, Foster was called into action in the third period, according to reports. He stopped all seven shots fired at him in 14 minutes. In the waning moments, the United Center crowd chanted his name. Foster, a former Western Michigan goaltender (2002-06), had attended a dozen or so Blackhawks games as a fail-safe backup. He told reporters afterward (watch above) that he usually sits in the press box and eats dinner. Not this time. In one of sports\u2019 true Walter Mitty moments, the married father of two got to do what most people can only dream of: star for their local major league team. After that, balancing a ledger might not pack the same thrill.  A few hours ago I was sitting on the computer typing on a 10-key,  Foster said afterward.  Now I\u2019m standing in front of you guys having just finished 14 and a half minutes of NHL hockey.  According to the Chicago Tribune, Foster, from nearby Oak Park, will be back in goal Friday \u2015 in the Johnny\u2019s Icehouse Adult League after his shift at Golub Capital. Well, it was glorious while it lasted. "

      "text": "Michigan State University paid a public relations company $517,343 to monitor and track social media activity surrounding the recent Larry Nassar sexual abuse case, the Lansing State Journal reported on Wednesday.  Many of the social media accounts the New York-based firm Weber Shandwick monitored included accounts of survivors, their families and notable celebrities, journalists and politicians. The Lansing State Journal included screenshots of Weber Shandwick\u2019s report to MSU that quoted specific survivors\u2019 tweets, retweets and commentary. The PR firm also outlined news articles that created spikes in conversation surrounding the Nassar case.  MSU\u2019s Office of Communication and Brand Strategy had initially been collecting and tracking the information, but handed the majority of the work over to Weber Shandwick in December.   Michigan State University hired Weber Shandwick in December 2017 to provide crisis communications counsel as well as additional media staffing to handle the high volume of communications tasks related to the Larry Nassar matter,  a spokeswoman for the university told HuffPost.  The relationship ended in early March and we are no long working together.   Although this type of monitoring is not uncommon in criminal cases, the explosive report garnered intense media attention and prompted many Nassar survivors to criticize the surveillance as invasive and triggering.  Weber Shandwick responded to the criticism in a press release provided to HuffPost.  The majority of our work involved crisis counsel to address the tragedy. We were not hired to monitor victims\u2019 social media accounts. As with any assignment, we forwarded to our clients traditional media and publicly available social media pertaining to the horrible tragedy at MSU, including statements made online by the victims,  the statement reads.  The victims were and continue to be the most important voices in the conversation.   Criminal defense attorney Stuart Slotnick, who is not affiliated with the Nassar case, told HuffPost that while MSU\u2019s move may appear to be borderline unethical, it is not unheard of and usually doesn\u2019t violate any laws.  Monitoring social media accounts is not uncommon in the world of litigation. Although it may appear to be unseemly, when monitoring the accounts of victims of the crime, MSU could have been being proactive in addressing complaints by hearing them directly the source,  he said.  There are no legal implications to monitoring social media accounts, so long as they are public accounts and not private.   Still, many survivors feel the university unjustly invaded their privacy. Finding out that MSU was surveilling them the entire time they were screaming for justice has made many survivors feel they\u2019re being targeted yet again \u2015 and by the very institution that so horribly failed them in the first place.   I was absolutely disgusted to learn that MSU was using such an invasive tactic,  former gymnast and Nassar survivor Larissa Boyce told HuffPost in an email.  I felt violated all over again.   Boyce, who says that Nassar began abusing her when she was 16 years old in 1997 and continued until 2001, told then-MSU gymnastics coach Kathie Klages of the abuse the year it started. Klages, who has since retired, told Boyce she must have misunderstood the medical procedure and sent the teenager back to Nassar. After everything Boyce has endured at the hands of MSU, she said she\u2019s not surprised by the university\u2019s most recent move.   Sadly, I\u2019m not surprised, as this is yet another example of how [MSU is] more concerned about protecting their brand than survivors,  she said.  They\u2019ve been saying that they are on our side but this proves once again they are re-victimizing us and trying to find ways to attack our character. Time to start looking at their own house! That money should have been used to check all of their employees computers & social media!  Rachael Denhollander, the first woman to publicly accuse Nassar of sexual abuse, reacted on Twitter to the surveillance news Wednesday.  If MSU wanted to know about me and other survivors, they could have just talked to us. We had outstanding offers [to] meet with them,  she wrote.  Nassar served as the team doctor for USA Gymnastics and for several different sports teams on MSU\u2019s campus. Over the course of two decades, he sexually abused over 260 young girls and women under the guise of medical treatment. He recently received three concurrent sentences of 60 years, 40-125 years and 40-175 years in prison for child sexual abuse and child pornography.  Although Nassar will spend the rest of his life in prison, many survivors have called for heads to roll at USA Gymnastics, the U.S. Olympic Committee and specifically MSU, claiming those institutions enabled Nassar\u2019s abuse. Several of Nassar\u2019s victims (including Boyce) say they reported the abuse to MSU coaches and trainers over the course of two decades, but their accusations were continually disregarded or swept under the rug. At least 14 MSU representatives knew about Nassar\u2019s abuse and failed to report it. Both the Michigan attorneys general\u2019s office and the U.S. Education Department have launched investigations into how the university handled the Nassar abuse allegations.  Attorney John Manly, who represents more than 100 Nassar victims, tweeted his disappointment as well:  Michigan State paid $500,000.00 in January to spy on Nassar survivors and their families on social media. The MSU Board was copied on these reports. Not one Board member had the moral courage to say this is wrong. Stop it. Not one. Shame on MSU. Shame on each and every Trustee.  Morgan McCaul, a Nassar survivor and current first-year student at MSU, explained to HuffPost how invasive it felt when she found out the university had been tracking her social media all along.   While MSU tracked our social media cries for accountability and justice, they ignored and enabled yet another predator \u2015 and they did it at an incomprehensible cost,  McCaul said, referring to Nassar\u2019s longtime boss, William Strampel, who was recently arrested on multiple sexual misconduct charges for allegedly sexual harassing and assaulting female MSU students.  McCaul told The State News, MSU\u2019s student newspaper, that she believes this is possibly the worst thing the univeristy has done.  "

Under Armour Inc., which owns the nutritional app, announced Thursday that an  unauthorized party  gained access to the data in late February. Information acquired by the hackers included user names, email addresses and hashed passwords, the company said. Social Security numbers and driver\u2019s license numbers were not affected since the app doesn\u2019t collect that information. Payment card information was also unaffected because the company collects and processes that information separately.  The company says it does not know the identity of the party responsible for the security breach. MyFitnessPal allows users to track their daily meals, count how many calories they consume and search for the nutritional information of specific foods. In a notice to the app\u2019s users, Under Armour Chief Digital Officer Paul Fipps said the company learned of the breach on Sunday. The company alerted its users four days later.  We are working with leading data security firms to assist in our investigation,  Fipps wrote.  We have also notified and are coordinating with law enforcement authorities.  The company is urging MyFitnessPal users to change their passwords immediately.  Under Armour is the latest victim of a string of security breaches affecting companies in all industries. Orbitz, a travel booking site, announced this month that it had a security breach that affected about 880,000 payment cards from the site\u2019s users. Equifax also announced this month that it had another massive data breach affecting 2.4 million customers in 2017, six months after it revealed a previous breach that affected 143 million additional people. Other major organizations to face widespread security breaches in recent years include Yahoo, Uber and the Pentagon. "

The piece is stationed in Ronaldo\u2019s birthplace of Madeira, Portugal, at the airport that now bears his name. You might describe it as an ... interesting interpretation.  The internet meme machine was savage to say the least, and Santos took the negative response very hard. Santos and his family had a rough time in the weeks and months that followed the unveiling, telling Bleacher Report that he suffered from feelings of humiliation and isolation.  Bleacher Report challenged Santos to try again, and the artist accepted. The outlet documented the process (in the video above) and, as you can see, the new bust is light-years beyond the original in terms of accuracy. "

      "text": "A judicial oversight committee says an embattled New Jersey judge violated rules of conduct when he asked an alleged rape victim during a May 2016 hearing whether she knew to close her legs to prevent sexual assault. The state Supreme Court\u2019s Advisory Committee on Judicial Conduct detailed the incident along with three other alleged code violations in a complaint against Superior Court Judge John F. Russo filed on Monday. The woman had been seeking a restraining order against the man who allegedly raped her.  During the hearing, the plaintiff said she and the defendant had just returned from a trip to Home Depot when he raped her. The two share a daughter. Later, Russo took over a line of questioning from a defense attorney aimed at illustrating that the plaintiff could have done more to prevent the assault. When Russo asked whether she knew  how to stop somebody from having intercourse  with her, the plaintiff gave several responses, saying she would either physically harm the assailant, tell them no or run away.  Close your legs? Call the police? Did you do any of those things?  Russo continued, according to the court transcript.  The complaint stated that the judge  mistreated the victim  with his  irrelevant  and  discourteous  questions. In another instance detailed in the complaint, Russo allegedly violated rules of conduct when he ruled on an alimony case in which he admitted to knowing both parties. The judge reduced the amount of back alimony owed by the man involved in the case from $10,000 to just $300.  Judge Russo looks forward to a public hearing in which he will be able to respond to the allegations against him,  attorney David Corrigan said in a statement provided to KPVI, a local NBC affiliate.  We have respect for the process as well as the advisory committee on judicial conduct, and therefore won\u2019t comment further.  Russo was placed on paid administrative leave from New Jersey\u2019s Ocean County Courthouse in May. According to the Asbury Park Press, the decision came after he allegedly threw a file at a female law clerk, although there are other previous complaints about his behavior. Superior Court Assignment Judge Marlene Lynch Ford has told Russo he can not return to work until he submits to and passes a psychiatric evaluation, the Park Press reported. "

      "text": "Stock photography is synonymous with outdated and ridiculous gender stereotypes. There\u2019s women laughing alone with salad \u2015 a viral meme that has morphed into women laughing alone with tablets \u2015 and the many shots of alpha men sitting at the head of boardroom tables or barbecuing steaks. The models in all these examples are usually white and extremely heteronormative. But stock photo companies are increasingly trying to reflect our current culture. In the past few years, Getty, Adobe and Shutterstock have all tried to break away from the clich\u00e9s they\u2019re known for reinforcing, especially as a new crop of stock photo startups focus exclusively on diverse images. Giants like Getty started with tackling female stereotypes, teaming up with Sheryl Sandberg in 2014 to create the  Lean In  collection, which shows women working in labs and hiking, no romaine lettuce in sight. Now the company is turning its lens on men by focusing on the theme of  Masculinity Undone.  Getty recently released a compilation of images that feature men parenting, hugging one another and looking pensive as they stare out windows. Launched in January, the photos include men of color, men with long hair, and men who are shirtless despite lacking well-defined pecs and biceps.  We\u2019re trying to focus on imagery that represents a more complex version of manhood and a more gentle side,  Guy Merrill, Getty\u2019s global head of art, told HuffPost.  We\u2019re breaking away from stereotypes: the business leader, the absent father and buffoon \u2026 the lonely guy who doesn\u2019t need any friends or community.  Shutterstock has created a  Modern Man  collection full of male nurses, gay couples and guys who love to garden, while Adobe is showcasing  The Fluid Self,  which includes photos of men wearing makeup, earrings and dressed in drag, as well as portraits of the transgender community. The shift comes amid an ongoing cultural conversation about what it means to  be a man.  There\u2019s been a backlash against the type of aggressive, authoritative manliness embodied by President Donald Trump and white nationalists, along with a growing awareness that men struggle with mental illness and high suicide rates. Today\u2019s hip young male celebrities are less macho in appearance and demeanor \u2015 think Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet and Harry Styles. Jay-Z talks openly about being in therapy, Jaden Smith wears dresses, and in every episode of  Queer Eye,  the Netflix makeover series, a man breaks down in tears. Advertisers have taken note: Last year Axe body spray launched a campaign called  Is It OK For Guys?  that tackles the vulnerabilities men are taught to suppress (Is it OK to be skinny? Is it OK to be depressed?). And Lululemon released videos of men talking about emotional strength. Stock photo companies say data, client feedback and cultural trends have pushed them to focus on changing definitions of masculinity and gender fluidity. In the past few years, Getty searches for  man meditation  went up by 126 percent,  man looking worried  by 100 percent and  gay dads  by 53 percent, according to the company. A recent Shutterstock survey found that 41 percent of U.S. marketers think it\u2019s important to use images that reflect  modern day society.   Younger people are getting into college and moving into the workforce and they have much more modern ideas about masculinity and femininity,  said Robyn Lange, Shutterstock\u2019s curator.  There\u2019s no longer buckets you place these [genders] into. It\u2019s more of a spectrum.  In theory, stock photography is well-poised to help people think more progressively about gender. These images are ubiquitous, appearing on billboards and storefronts and in online articles and videos, where they are constantly tempting us to take out loans, travel to Hawaii and whiten our teeth.   People aren\u2019t aware of how much stock they\u2019re seeing every day, everywhere, on every platform,  said Brenda Mills, Adobe\u2019s principal of creative services and visual trends.  And so it has a huge influence over people\u2019s lives.  Raising the visibility of men with regular bodies being emotionally vulnerable or working in traditionally  female  jobs would allow them to become normal aspects of masculinity, rather than effeminate anomalies.   Part of what we need are images to help us create a new reality,  said Tristan Bridges, an assistant sociology professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.  What would it look like if men and women didn\u2019t have to wear different types of clothes or we didn\u2019t have to imagine them in different types of jobs?  But Giorgia Aiello, an associate media and communication professor at the University of Leeds in England who studies stock photos, sees these diversity collections as  branding exercises  \u2015 a way to appear  cutting edge  rather than to truly change gender norms.   Although Getty images in particular tries to really confer a political kind of tone to what they are doing with stock photography, in the end the bottom line is purely commercial,  she said.  In some ways it is good they are doing it, but it\u2019s certainly not going to really deeply affect their business model.   Stock photo businesses have little control over what their photographers shoot and how clients use those images. Getty and Shutterstock both have more than 200,000 contributors, ranging from iPhone amateurs to professionals, who all earn royalties every time their work is licensed. While companies send out reports detailing the type of shots they want \u2015 more men sitting in half lotus, please \u2015 once contributors have been accepted onto the platform, they can upload whatever images they choose, so long as they aren\u2019t offensive or illegal. Getty\u2019s  Lean In  collection, for example, represents just 0.01 percent of the company\u2019s more than 190 million images.  If someone wants to shoot pictures of women eating salad, despite all the memes, we can\u2019t stop them,  said Merrill, though he noted that Getty art directors are working directly with some of their professional contributors on  Masculinity Undone -themed shoots.  Stock photo companies also have no control over how clients use the photos. In 2007, Getty\u2019s top-selling image for the search term  woman  was a half-naked woman lying on a bed. Now it\u2019s a woman hiking a rocky trail. But Aiello said that doesn\u2019t necessarily equal progress. She has found that photos from the  Lean In  collection most often appeared in  lightweight  lifestyle articles or articles on gender discrimination.   Quite a few of these images showing women as scientists were not used in general science journalism,  she said,  but in articles that talked about how difficult it was for women to have a career in science.   While it\u2019s possible that images of diverse masculinity will be confined to pieces about fashion or the evolution of manhood rather than used to illustrate more general topics, Adobe\u2019s Mills doesn\u2019t think that\u2019s a problem. Her  fashion and grooming  clients currently have the biggest appetite for non-stereotypical images of men, she said, because those photos help them reach a new market. But more companies have begun to show interest.   I\u2019m surprised by some of the clients, who I thought might be more conservative, being incredibly open to this \u2018Fluid Self\u2019 trend,  Mills said.  They\u2019re actually incredibly hungry for it.  Getty\u2019s Merrill said that even if his customers aren\u2019t begging for more nuanced photos of men, his team has a responsibility to push them in a more progressive direction.   It\u2019s not simply our jobs to create the images our customers want \u2015 we also want to re-picture clich\u00e9s for them,  he said.  This is where we need to be in a year or two. Our customers might not be there yet, but we know they are going to be. And we want to make sure they have the pictures and the imagery when that happens.   "

      "text": "A sixth woman has come forward to complain about sexual discrimination at Monster Energy, a male-dominated beverage company that appears to be plagued by a toxic work culture.  The woman, Karen Simmons, a 50-year-old former sales representative based in Alabama, spent nearly two years with Monster. She amassed a strong track record, even as she fended off one of her Atlanta-based managers, Ted Cook, who hit on her, made comments about her breasts, tried to get her drunk and invited her more than once for an  evening nightcap  in his hotel room on work trips, she told HuffPost.  Robert Duck, Simmons\u2019 direct boss who works out of Monster\u2019s office in Florida, also witnessed Cook\u2019s behavior, but told her to brush it off, she said.  He said Ted was harmless, \u2018a dirty old man,\u2019  Simmons recalled.  Through a company spokesman, Duck said Simmons never complained. When reached by phone by HuffPost, he hung up. He did not respond to follow-up texts. Cook also did not respond to a call, text or LinkedIn message.  Simmons took her complaints no further.  What was I gonna say? I loved my job. I needed my job,  she said.  Simmons had worked for about 20 years in the beverage industry, a notoriously unfriendly business for women.  I knew saying things gets you retaliation.  What Simmons did not realize was that whether or not she spoke up, she was already trapped inside a company where the odds are stacked against women.  Last April, Simmons was fired for reasons she still doesn\u2019t quite understand. Monster says it was for poor performance, according to a spokesman for the company. Simmons says her dismissal occurred a few months after receiving a generally positive performance review and just as she was poised to win an internal sales contest. In the fall, she filed sex and age discrimination charges against Monster at the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Monster is also facing lawsuits from five other women over complaints of sexual discrimination and other issues, as first reported in a HuffPost investigation in January. One Monster executive, head of music marketing Brent Hamilton, is facing felony assault charges for allegedly strangling his girlfriend on a company business trip. He is still employed by the company. Another executive, John Kenneally, a vice president accused of sexually harassing two women at the company, resigned after HuffPost published details of the accusations in January. He ran the business unit that Simmons worked in. In public statements at the time, the company painted the women as disgruntled employees and said that the suits were unrelated.   Monster Energy has zero-tolerance for discrimination or harassment of any kind,  the company said in January.  Monster takes all reported complaints very seriously. Any suggestions to the contrary are false.  Just as HuffPost was set to publish this story, Monster announced it was hiring a third party to review its human resource policies and procedures. The investigators will report straight to the company\u2019s board of directors.  We are confident that the recent portrayal of the company in the media is not representative of [our] culture and practices,  Monster chairman and CEO Rodney Sacks and vice chair and president Hilton Schlosberg said in a statement. But they added that  in the context of the allegations made by the women bringing these lawsuits, we believe it is prudent.  The company declined to provide more details on the third party.  If there are areas where there are deficients, we will correct them,  Sacks and Schlosberg said. In a statement to HuffPost earlier in March, Monster said it wasn\u2019t aware of Simmons\u2019 complaints until recently.   Ms. Simmons did not make any allegation of harassment to the company or to her manager while she was employed by the company,  the statement said. Monster only learned of the claim at a mediation session with Simmons and her lawyer in mid-February, the statement said. This was about three weeks after HuffPost published its investigation, the statement points out. Monster also said that Cook is no longer with the company. Simmons\u2019 former boss Duck, who she said witnessed Cook\u2019s behavior, is still working at Monster.  Through a spokesman, Monster also told HuffPost that Simmons\u2019 account was  not accurate.  Simmons\u2019 last employee evaluation included significant feedback about areas for improvement, the spokesman said. It was not positive. In response to other questions and requests for information, the spokesman wrote:  Many of the other allegations or questions are untrue, are missing facts or are irrelevant but we are not going to engage in a back and forth about this.   After reading HuffPost\u2019s reports, and looking into the cases filed against Monster, Simmons was shocked to learn that another female employee at the company, Page Zeringue, had gone to the human resources department to complain about Cook \u2015 well before Simmons started working under him.  In a lawsuit against Monster, Zeringue alleges that her complaint to HR helped trigger her firing, ostensibly for bad performance. Meanwhile, Cook was sent to sexual harassment training, according to internal documents viewed by HuffPost. This was around the same time Simmons was hired.  Monster Energy markets its drinks primarily to men using cliched tropes about masculinity. Scantily clad Monster Girls in leather bikini tops serve as brand ambassadors. One beverage is actually called  Assault.  A few years ago, the company gave out Monster branded condoms as a promotional gimmick. That toxic male culture translates into policy where sexual harassment is not taken seriously. Monster\u2019s employee guidelines \u2015 reviewed by HuffPost \u2015 require that managers who observe sexual misconduct must report it. But in Simmons\u2019 case, it appears that her direct boss, Duck, never informed HR about Cook\u2019s conduct.  Even if HR learns about misbehavior, what passes for an investigation into sexual harassment complaints seems to amount to a surface questioning of the parties involved, where the accounts of men are weighed more seriously.   At Monster, terminations may be helped along by a confusing performance review process where managers are allowed to add damaging comments into evaluations, months after employees read their reviews, according to documents reviewed by HuffPost.  Even in an industry known for being heavily male, Monster stands out \u2015 particularly in the sales division where Simmons worked.   Overall, only 13 percent of the company\u2019s 505-person U.S. sales team are women. If you include administrative assistants, the percentage rises to 18 percent female, according to an internal employee directory from January obtained by HuffPost. None of the company\u2019s 11 vice-presidents in sales are women.  Monster said some of the numbers HuffPost obtained were incorrect, but declined to offer specifics or provide its own data. In an earlier statement to HuffPost the company said  many women hold top leadership positions within Monster,  and pointed to its chief commercialization officer, Emelie Tirre. Still, sales is so male-dominated at Monster that at a 2016 national sales meeting in Las Vegas \u2015 even with human resource representatives in attendance \u2015 a vice-president told a blatantly misogynistic joke to a packed room, according to three separate accounts from current and former employees.  The joke goes like this: There is an old bull and a young bull on a hill, overlooking a field of cows. Young bull says to the old bull:  Let\u2019s run down there and fuck a cow.  Old bull says, nah:  Let\u2019s walk down there and fuck them all.  It was meant to inspire. Simmons recalls being appalled. But she was used to hearing sexist talk from male colleagues. After all, she had spent most of her career in beverage sales, a notoriously sexist culture. She knew how to handle herself.  Over the past three years, at least four other women in the east division, where Simmons worked, were fired or pushed out. They include Simmons, two other women who are suing the company for sex discrimination, and one who declined to speak on the record with HuffPost but has since quit. As of January 2018, there were only 16 women out of 153 employees working in the east division. Simmons was often the only woman at the dinners and events where she would meet up with Cook and Duck. Given the company\u2019s cultural penchant for partying, drinking alcohol at these meet-ups was a given.  She didn\u2019t drink, and repeatedly rebuffed Cook\u2019s efforts to  get her drunk,  she said. She declined his invitations for a  nightcap  in his hotel room.   The more Ted drank, the more handsy he got,  Simmons told HuffPost. On one occasion when he asked for a hug, Simmons said she uncomfortably gave him a half-hug. He wasn\u2019t satisfied, and pulled her in for a do-over, she said.  He said, \u2019I felt that,  Simmons said, meaning he could feel the pressure of her breasts on his chest.   Arguably, Simmons should never have had to deal with Cook in the first place. Two years earlier Zeringue had filed her complaint about him with the human resources department, according to the lawsuit she filed last year against the company. Huffpost obtained Zeringue\u2019s original complaint to HR. In it she said Cook had a reputation for getting grabby when he drinks, and was known as  Touchy Ted  around the office. She detailed an incident where he talked to her about her breasts and those of a coworker; he also pulled the hugging-close move on her, she said. The HR department reached out to Cook\u2019s boss, Kenneally, the executive who recently resigned in the face of harassment allegations after HuffPost\u2019s investigation published. Kenneally defended Cook, telling the HR representative he had already spoken with him about the incident and there were  no noted recurrences,  according to a review of an internal HR report obtained by HuffPost. Kenneally also made a point of criticizing Zeringue. Her  performance is not where it needs to be,  he is quoted as saying.  When Cook was confronted by HR, he confessed and said  he learned his lesson,  according to internal notes. He also conceded that  touchy Ted  was one of the nicknames he was known by inside the company, another being  Uncle Ted.  He was assigned to sexual harassment training, called  stop sexual harassment training for supervisors,  and given a warning. It\u2019s unclear if HR ever planned any kind of followup to make sure he stayed on track. Zeringue was fired a month later. In her complaint against Monster she claims her firing amounted to retaliation for speaking up. That suit is now headed to private arbitration \u2015 outside the public court system. It was around this time, at a dinner in New Orleans that Simmons attended with Cook, Duck and several other male Monster employees that she said she heard them joking about  having to go to HR classes,  if they misbehaved.  It was just like a big joke,  Simmons said Simmons\u2019 last few months at Monster played out like a corporate gaslighting.  In February 2017, less than two months after she had received a decent performance review from Duck, he asked to meet up with her in Florida where they had both traveled for business.  What happened next came as a total shock. Duck showed her a disciplinary write-up.   For stuff I didn\u2019t do,  Simmons said. The writeup \u2015 which HuffPost has reviewed \u2015 claimed she was unwilling to leave her hometown for work. Yet, she was in Florida on a business trip at the time she was given the writeup.  I was out of town every week,  she said. The writeup also claims that Duck spoke with Simmons in January about these issues. Simmons said the only feedback she got that month came when she downloaded her performance review from the company\u2019s internal website. Monster provided HuffPost with a copy of the document. Dated Dec. 31, the review judges Simmons\u2019 performance as  Meets Standards,  giving her a 2.14 rating out of 4, and was generally upbeat and positive but is peppered with constructive criticism.   At this point the only thing I can ask Karen to improve on is slowing down,  Duck wrote.  She also needs a little more work on time management.  He called her a  great problem solver,  who sometimes needs help prioritizing,  I have asked her to make sure when she schedules a meeting...to ALWAYS make sure she can do it\u2026  In the category of  job knowledge and skill,  Duck gave Simmons a rating of 3 or  exceeds expectations.  So the negative writeup baffled Simmons.  She cried.   Where is this coming from?  she asked him. She wanted to understand what she did wrong, so she could fix things. He refused to provide more details.  He said I was making things worse and to go home and forget about it,  Simmons said. For about a month-and-a-half after that, Duck, still Simmons\u2019 direct supervisor, did not talk to Simmons. She said he wouldn\u2019t respond to texts or calls. One thing he apparently did do: update Simmons\u2019 Dec. 31 performance review \u2015 topping the document off with an extremely harsh  summary paragraph  slamming her for poor performance.  The added paragraph is dated March 3, 2017. The tone of this text is vastly different from the rest of the document.  At this point, Karen has lost the trust of some of her bottlers and needs to \u2018fix\u2019 this soon or she will struggle,  Duck wrote.  Karen acts disconnected in meetings and face to face with her Coke partners.  Duck used gender-coded words like  abrasive  and  demanding  to describe her demeanor with outside contacts at Coca-Cola bottlers Simmons worked with. The final comment was meant to assess Simmons\u2019 work from the end of December through March, a Monster spokesman told HuffPost.  The final comments reflect not only her manager\u2019s assessment of her work through 12/31/17,  he said.  But the final comment on 03/03/17 was also influenced by her performance in the months after 12/31/17 and before the final comment.  Simmons said she had not seen this paragraph until she was asked about it by HuffPost.  Monster, which provided HuffPost with the review, claimed that Simmons had likely seen the additional paragraph. However, Monster could not provide evidence that she did. According to Monster\u2019s records, Simmons signed her review on March 1 \u2015 two days before Duck signed off on the harsh additional paragraph.  Finally, in late April, Duck broke the silence. He called Simmons and said he needed to meet in person. But when he met her in a hotel lobby in her hometown of Daphne, Alabama, he was there with Cook and they had an HR representative on the phone to talk to her.  She was fired.  It was like somebody just punched me in the stomach,  Simmons said. She cried and begged, she said, telling them she needed the insurance and that her family would suffer. She was offered two weeks severance \u2015 if she signed a document promising not to sue.  I didn\u2019t sign. I just think it was wrong. It was totally wrong,  she said.  Two weeks pay for what they did is wrong.  Zeringue \u2015 the woman who had complained about Cook years earlier \u2015 also was offered two weeks severance when she was fired. She declined, too. Interestingly, Cook retired less than a month later. It\u2019s unclear why. His colleagues threw him a going away party.  And just a few months later, during Christmas time in 2017, Cook returned to Monster\u2019s Atlanta office dressed up as Santa Claus. Young women at the office sat in his lap and posed for pictures. One woman posted a shot on Facebook captioned #UncleTed.  Simmons, meanwhile, took her dismissal hard. She was so embarrassed about being fired that she stopped leaving her home during the day, not wanting anyone in her small Alabama hometown to ask her why she wasn\u2019t working.  The first six months were awful,  she said.  If I needed to go out, I\u2019d go at three or four in the morning or ten or 11 at night.  Because she lost her job, Simmons\u2019 husband, a 68-year-old who supervises utility crews in Tampa, has had to put off his retirement. He had relocated to Tampa temporarily to make a little extra cash before finishing his career. Now it\u2019s unclear when he can come home.    This has affected my marriage, my life. It\u2019s been really tough on my family,  she said, breaking down in tears. Simmons is responsible for paying college tuition for her 21-year-old daughter.  My daughter worries all the time. I told her don\u2019t worry about it; we\u2019ll figure a way around it.  Do you have a story to tell about sexual harassment or discrimination at Monster or another workplace?

      "text": "In the face of the chaos and confusion that come with raising a family today, parents across America turn to a very specific place for sanctuary and relief. While it may not be fancy or private, it\u2019s got an air of sophistication and serenity. What is this magical place? Well... Target, apparently. It\u2019s no secret that parents, particularly moms, love to love Target. They write rhapsodizing blog posts, create fan Instagram accounts, draw comics and tweet endlessly about their Target obsessions. At least one mom chose to take her maternity photos at a Target store, and another even gave birth to her child in one (albeit unintentionally). But what exactly is it that makes Target so appealing to moms and dads? We spoke to marketing experts, therapists and parents themselves to find out.  I never thought dashing to Target without kids would feel like a mini-vacation, but it does. And sometimes that\u2019s all a mom of little kids needs to recharge,  mom and blogger Jennifer S. White told HuffPost. Indeed, many parents find that Target offers them an opportunity to escape the chaos and stress at home without feeling guilty \u2026 because, after all, they\u2019re running errands and buying necessities (and some non-necessities, too) for their families.   Target is close by and a more socially acceptable place for parents to sneak away to solo than, say, a bar,  said mom and blogger Samantha Taylor, who also told HuffPost she sees solo Target trips as  mini-vacations.  Jennifer Cutler, an assistant professor of marketing at Northwestern University\u2019s Kellogg School of Management, believes Target offers a sense of  whimsical escapism  that particularly appeals to parents.  Part of its brand is trying to make the shopping experience a treat. One thing that parents have in common is a shortage of time. Being able to reframe the drudgery of running errands as whimsical escapism is really powerful,  she told HuffPost, pointing out the colorful \u2015 and even magical \u2015 imagery in the brand\u2019s marketing materials.  It\u2019s saying, \u2019Come to this magical place where you can get whatever your heart desires; a clean, friendly place with Starbucks coffee and popcorn waiting for you,\u2019  Cutler added.  I think that really resonates because it joins a productive activity with something whimsical and almost vacation-like in the experience.  The convenience and affordability of a big-box store are undeniable as well.  Target is so addictive because it has everything you need: from batteries, to groceries, to cat litter. And it has a bunch of stuff you don\u2019t need but really want when you see it, like super-cute earrings for you and cheap, adorable outfit separates for your kids,  Taylor explained.  We feel guilty about going on a frivolous shopping binge but not about throwing a $5 pair of clearance earrings in with the cleaning supplies inside our cart.  Still, it goes beyond the convenience and low prices, which many major stores offer. The physical experience of being in a Target store is another reason parents give for their fandom.   Walking into a Target is a mild high in itself,  said Taylor.  That food court and smell of popcorn. That cute little dog. That comfortingly simple logo. That Dollar Spot where everything is actually $3, but that\u2019s OK.  The blogger also also cited the presence of Starbucks in many Targets:  HELLO strolling the racks under the guise of shopping for necessities with a steaming Caramel Macchiato.  The neat appearance of the stores can also feel refreshing for parents, as households with young kids are not necessarily so clean and organized, said Mabel Yiu, a licensed marriage and family therapist and mother of twins.   You walk into Target, and the lighting, the colors, even the smell really capture you because it feels great,  said Yiu.  It\u2019s like it increases the dopamine in the brain. You see that everything is really well-organized and even color-coded. As a mom, my home doesn\u2019t look like that. So you walk in and think, \u2018This is really great.\u2019   Dad and blogger Beau Coffron echoed this sentiment.  They do a great job of keeping the aisles organized, so you don\u2019t feel like you\u2019re in the middle of a tornado with stuff everywhere, like some stores are,  he told HuffPost. The look and feel of Target stores appeal to consumers\u2019 different senses \u2015 from the sound of upbeat music to the scent of coffee and popcorn. Rima Tour\u00e9-Tillery, an assistant professor at the Kellogg School who studies the intersection of motivation and self-perception in marketing, said the inviting appearance of Target relates to the brand\u2019s colors: red and white.  Research shows that people see red as a fun, fiery, daring color and  the color of love.  Meanwhile, white gives a sense of cleanliness, spaciousness and elegance.   These associations are not things people consciously think about, but they influence you,  said Tour\u00e9-Tillery.  So just being exposed to the red and white in the store can give you an impression of sophistication.  Maybe that explains why people say  Tar-jay  to make the store sound fancier. Collaborations with high-end brands like Proenza Schouler, Missoni and Jason Wu also add to this classier image. Store layouts and color schemes are typically very conscious choices meant to appeal to consumers.   Brands aren\u2019t stupid. They\u2019re studying this, and the retail environment they\u2019re trying to create is to maximize the experience, the memories, the emotion,  said the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania marketing professor Americus Reed, noting that there are design principles meant to pique shoppers\u2019 curiosity and guide them through the store. Store designs can also appeal to children shopping with their parents.  Aisles are designed a certain way. Things that are going to be important for kids are lower to the ground. That\u2019s for a reason,  Reed told HuffPost.  In the case of Target, parents can use the presence of toys and other fun things for kids to their advantage \u2015 by using them as potential rewards for good behavior in the store.   I prefer to shop Target alone as a sort of pathetic mini-vacation, but if I bring my kids, I like to keep them strapped in to the baby seat whenever possible,  Taylor told HuffPost.  Usually I\u2019ll reward them with a trip to the toy aisle, just to look, if they behave.  Creating a memorable, appealing shopping experience is crucial in the age of online retail giants. Indeed, recent reports have shown disappointing profits for Target as it competes with Amazon.   Behemoths like Amazon are commoditizing convenience. People don\u2019t want to go out and be physically in stores as much anymore because you can just hop online and get a box in a few hours,  Reed said.  You have to create other experiences in a shopping context that are going to make it worthwhile to go out and do that instead of going to Amazon.com. So maybe that\u2019s creating some more motivational impetus for these brands like Target to craft a richer experience for parents and children going in the store.  One way to combat the growing influence of Amazon happens to be another reason experts cited when exploring why parents are so obsessed with Target: identity loyalty.   The concept is that there are some brands for which the brand itself transcends the functional features, the utilitarian benefits in terms of what it does, and it becomes something that is part of who you are,  Reed explained.  When the brand becomes part and parcel with some important aspect of your desired self-expression, then the brand\u2019s identity and your own identity become fused. It\u2019s like the brand is part of who you are, and you have loyalty to it because it\u2019s a symbol of what you aspire to express to other people.  Kellogg marketing professor Angela Lee echoed that.  Many young moms identify with Target, with the image of \u2018fun and fashionable\u2019 that the store projects. That\u2019s what it means when one is a committed loyalist \u2015 the brand becomes part of the self.  When brands achieve identity loyalty, they essentially have a free marketing department. Loyal followers proselytize and also defend the brand against criticism, because an attack on the brand feels in some way like an attack on the self.  In some ways, one\u2019s identity as a parent can become wrapped up in a store like Target.  At the end of a shopping trip, you have shopped for many aspects of your life \u2015 you got birthday gifts for a kid\u2019s party, gifts for your in-laws, yoga pants for exercising, work clothes, etc. You walk out feeling very accomplished and competent,  Yiu explained.  And your self-image matches the idealized self you see in Target ads showing happy, competent parents.  White told HuffPost she\u2019s noticed many kids love Target almost as much as their parents do.   Once I took my kids out for ice cream. It was a surprise, and I expected them to be thrilled,  White recalled.  They weren\u2019t. They looked out the window, across the street to Target and said they wanted to go there for their \u2018surprise\u2019 instead.  In this way, the store creates opportunities for parenting wins, ways to live up to an idealized image of a perfect parent.  The connection between Target and identity might also involve the company\u2019s values and stances on specific issues \u2015 like its support for breastfeeding mothers and transgender people. White told HuffPost she supports the company\u2019s attention to many issues that matter to parents.  Target has done an incredible job attempting to stay on top of current parental concerns, like clothing and gender, and making the store accessible for families with special needs.   They\u2019re family conscious and socially conscious, so it\u2019s a cool brand to be behind and something to be proud of,  said Kathy Morelli, a New Jersey-based mental health counselor. Target as a company is clearly quite aware of its cult-like status among moms.  Target is much more than a place that just sells stuff. We\u2019re a meaningful part of the community and our guests\u2019 lives. From our registry benefits to baby must-haves to the many ways moms can shop and get their orders quickly and all at affordable prices, we often hear that Target is her \u2018happy place,\u2019 and that\u2019s a badge of honor we never take for granted,  Executive Vice President and Chief Marketing Officer Rick Gomez told HuffPost. The company has even played into its friendly image with family-focused initiatives, like their  First Target Run  onesies.  [W]e see a number of moms share on social that their first outing with their new baby is often to Target \u2015 it\u2019s where they feel safe, comfortable, and know they can check off a few errands and maybe sneak in a treat or two for themselves,  said Gomez.  We decided to have a little fun with this and thank moms who registered at Target by sending them a surprise \u2018First Target Run\u2019 onesie for their new baby. It was a huge hit and a way to bring a little extra joy to moms during this special time.  Of course, Target mania is not just a mom thing. With studies showing dads are more involved in their children\u2019s lives than ever (and the growing number of same-sex couples raising kids), it\u2019s no surprise many fathers are tweeting about their Target runs, too.   Usually I feel great because I can pick up anything I want there, and there\u2019s a location everywhere. So I can stop on my way home from work, or when I\u2019m just trying to get my kids out of the house for a bit,  Coffron told HuffPost.  Let\u2019s drink this Icee while we look at bikes and Easter candy, and also pick up an entertainment center on our way to the checkout.   Coffron said he and his wife also go to Target on date nights.  We usually don\u2019t have much time with our kids being babysat, so we grab a quick dinner and then go to Target. We are pretty much hopeless romantics, I guess,  he said.  But seriously it\u2019s fun because we can goof off and be silly but also be efficient because we\u2019ll just buy light bulbs at the same time.  Reed said his 7-year-old daughter loves going to Target \u2015 especially because she loves the popular  L.O.L. Surprise!  dolls you can buy there.  The professor said he\u2019s more than happy to take her on his Target runs and occasionally indulge her with a toy.   Parenting is the hardest job on the planet. Period,  he said.  Anything that makes life a little easier, that brings a little bit of joy to a child vis-\u00e0-vis what the parent is doing \u2015 in this case, running errands \u2015 is seen as this fantastic elixir. It\u2019s fantastic. I can take her to Target and she\u2019ll be happy, and I can also do some shopping and get some stuff done.  Of course, there are always concerns about spending and unhealthful materialism when it comes to fanaticism around a specific brand, given that the underlying mission is to sell you more products.   Unfortunately this Target movement is centered around consumerism, so I can\u2019t say for sure if it\u2019s good or bad,  Morelli told HuffPost. But Tour\u00e9-Tillery believes those concerns don\u2019t really apply to a brand like Target.    I think if we were talking about a luxury brand that sells thousand-dollar shoes, then that would be more relevant to the discussion. But Target is not a luxury brand. You\u2019re going to buy toilet paper and yogurt because you need those kinds of things. And if you can go there and feel good about yourself and have fun in the process, it really doesn\u2019t get better than that.  To say it all boils down to materialism also ignores another big appeal of the Target experience, something money doesn\u2019t necessarily buy: community. Overworked parents \u2015 particularly moms, who still bear most of the burden when it comes to household responsibilities \u2015 find comfort in knowing they aren\u2019t alone and tend to seek a sense of community  Let\u2019s face it. Moms still do most of the shopping, so it makes sense that they would be the ones to have this fun [Target fan] club,  said Tour\u00e9-Tillery. Because women tend to be more active on social media than men are, it also makes sense that the social media component of Target fandom would seem more mom-focused.  A lot of moms actually gather at Target, so it provides some social support,  said Yiu. Jennifer White told HuffPost she finds a sense of comfort and community in her Target runs, even if she\u2019s only shopping with her children.  After my second child came along, errands became stressful, and overwhelming. Toting two young children, and all their supplies, suddenly I didn\u2019t run a quick errand anymore. Nothing was \u2018quick,\u2019  White said.  Many times when I attempted a cute, easy errand to Target and it turned into a migraine, I\u2019d see other moms and we\u2019d smile knowingly at each other, or we\u2019d make jokes over our kids\u2019 heads,  she added.  That felt something like the \u2018village\u2019 everyone wants but not all of us have.   "

      "text": "Customers at some 5,000 Walmart locations around the United States will no longer see Cosmopolitan magazine among the publications for purchase in the check-out line.  That\u2019s because the retail giant decided to remove the magazine so customers would not be exposed to its  sexually exploitative  content, the National Center on Sexual Exploitation said in a press release on Tuesday.   This is what real change looks like in our #MeToo culture, and NCOSE is proud to work with a major corporation like Walmart to combat sexually exploitative influences in our society,  said NCOSE executive director Dawn Hawkins. The conservative organization, formerly known as Morality in Media, has been targeting Cosmopolitan magazine for some time \u2015 long before the Me Too movement came about. NCOSE has even named its fight against the magazine  a longtime priority.  NCOSE argues that the magazine  relentlessly glamorizes things like public, anal, group, and violent sex to its young female readership  and that minors should be protected from such material. The content, NCOSE argues, goes against the organization\u2019s mission is to  defend human dignity and to oppose sexual exploitation.   We are grateful for Walmart\u2019s cooperation and for Walmart leadership\u2019s recognition that corporations must do their part to change #MeToo culture,  Hawkins added. In a statement to Newsweek, Walmart said the store would still carry Cosmopolitan, but just not locate issues in the checkout aisles.  While this was primarily a business decision, the concerns raised were heard,  the statement said.  Yet critics were quick to point out how removing the magazine in the name of the Me Too movement seemed misguided, counterproductive and opportunistic.   The real world took another step toward its slow and sure conversion to The Handmaid\u2019s Tale this week,  Vogue.com\u2019s Michelle Ruiz wrote.  I\u2019m embarrassed for Hawkins because she just broadcasted to the entire country that she is a woman who has no idea what #MeToo means. ICYMI: #MeToo is about unwanted sex and sexual attention, sexual assault, and harassment. While Cosmopolitan is a magazine and a brand best known for its sex tips (including my personal favorite, a suggestion to ring a donut on a guy\u2019s penis)\u2014it is all about consensual adult sex.  More people piled on with criticism over Twitter. Other retailers have moved to relocate or block Cosmo\u2019s racy covers in the past, though they didn\u2019t invoke the Me Too movement while doing so. In 2000, supermarket giant Kroger installed blinders on some of the magazine\u2019s covers in 2,200 stores. The magazine did not immediately return HuffPost\u2019s request for comment, but did provide a statement to Buzzfeed about the publication\u2019s success in serving female readers.  Cosmopolitan is the most successful global media brand for young women, with award-winning content produced by leading female journalists. With our focus on empowerment, we are proud of all that the brand has achieved for women around the world in the areas of equality, health, relationships, career, politics and social issues.   "

      "text": "Police have arrested a former Michigan State University dean who supervised ex-USA Gymnastics physician Larry Nassar before the sports doctor was arrested and convicted of sexually abusing female athletes, the county sheriff said on Monday.  William Strampel is currently lodged at the Ingham County jail,  Ingham County Sheriff Scott Wriggelsworth told Reuters.  Wriggelsworth declined to say on what charges Strampel, 70, was arrested until the defendant was arraigned at a court hearing scheduled for Tuesday. A jail website listed the former dean of Michigan State\u2019s College of Osteopathic Medicine as an inmate there but gave no other information. The Detroit Free-Press newspaper reported that he faces multiple charges, at least one a felony. An attorney for Strampel, who has been on medical leave from the university since December, could not be reached by Reuters for comment on Monday evening. Michigan State University President John Engler said in February he was moving to revoke tenure for Strampel for failing to enforce 2014 guidelines created for Nassar in treating young athletes after complaints of sexual misconduct against him. The college has been criticized for its handling of complaints about Nassar stretching back for years. Michigan State terminated Nassar in September 2016 for his failure to follow those protocols, including having another person present when he performed the procedures. Numerous women said they were assaulted even after the guidelines were put in place. Nassar was sentenced in February to up to 125 years in prison after some 200 young women testified about decades of abuse at his hands. He had already received a sentence up to 175 years in a neighboring Michigan county, and was sentenced to a 60-year federal term for child pornography convictions.

      "text": "Uber will not renew its permit to test self-driving cars in California, a decision the state\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles discussed in a letter to the company on Tuesday. The permit is set to expire March 31, but Uber indefinitely halted its autonomous vehicle testing nationwide following a fatal crash last Sunday night in Tempe, Arizona. The collision killed 49-year-old Elaine Herzberg as she walked her bike across a road, and was the first fatal crash between an autonomous vehicle and a pedestrian.  In addition to this decision to suspend testing throughout the country, Uber has indicated that it will not renew its current permit to test autonomous vehicles in California,  California DMV deputy director and chief counsel Brian Soublet wrote to Uber. Uber confirmed the news in a statement to PBS NewsHour: Should Uber want to begin testing in California again, the company will need to re-apply for a permit, a process that will require it to provide a thorough explanation of the crash in Arizona, Soublet wrote in his letter.  Prior to resuming autonomous vehicle testing operations in California, Uber must apply for a new autonomous vehicle testing permit  he added.  Any application for a new permit will need to address any follow-up analysis or investigations from the recent crash in Arizona and may also require a meeting with the department.  In deciding to let its permit lapse in the state where it\u2019s headquartered, Uber\u2019s decision carries more symbolic weight than strategic significance. The bulk of the company\u2019s testing takes place elsewhere. Uber\u2019s Advanced Technologies Group, the unit tasked with developing self-driving cars, is headquartered in Pittsburgh. Uber also has self-driving cars in Phoenix, San Francisco and Toronto. Uber was already on thin ice with California regulators. In 2016, the state gave Uber\u2019s self-driving cars the boot after the company refused to get government approval to test there. Instead of applying for the $150 permits, Uber shipped its autonomous Volvo SUVs to Arizona, where regulations are more relaxed. Unlike Arizona, California requires car companies to report how often human drivers have to take over from the autonomous system, a hard measure of just how capable the car\u2019s driving abilities really are. Given Uber\u2019s reported engineering struggles, it would be to the company\u2019s advantage to log more miles elsewhere. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) ordered the company to indefinitely suspend testing in his state Monday.  "

Fahmy lives in the suburbs of Houston, and one question she hears a lot \u2015 especially in the summer \u2015 is whether she\u2019s hot in her hijab. When she was younger, Fahmy said, she always felt like she needed to say  no.  She didn\u2019t want people to feel sorry for her, or to think the hijab was somehow oppressive. She also didn\u2019t want to  seem like a weirdo  for covering up in hot weather. But as an adult, Fahmy said, she\u2019s done trying to appease other people.  What do I care if they think I\u2019m hot? I\u2019m proud of my hijab. I\u2019d wear it no matter what,  Fahmy told HuffPost in an email.  But also, YES, I\u2019M HOT. It\u2019s 112 degrees out here, WE\u2019RE ALL HOT.  The 33-year-old is now the artist behind the popular Instagram account @YesImHotInThis, where she posts comics about life as an American Muslim woman. Fahmy\u2019s comics, which are often inspired by her own experiences, poke fun at married life and cultural taboos. She also uses humor to address misconceptions people have about women who wear the hijab. Her account depicts mundane yet meaningful slices of American life. There are comics about Fahmy\u2019s love of Girl Scout cookies and Rice Krispies Treats, her mission to declutter her house, and her efforts to exercise. But mixed in are comics about less lighthearted subjects \u2015 concerns about police surveillance of Muslim communities, for example, or being anxious about unwanted attention on public transportation. American Muslim women who wear the hijab often experience bigotry and hate. It\u2019s important to tell their stories, Fahmy said.  Muslim women don\u2019t often get a platform to tell our stories or share the silly \u2015 sometimes stressful \u2015 idiosyncrasies of our day-to-day lives,  she said.  Fahmy has found web comics an  incredibly useful  way to share stories about Muslim life.  They\u2019re short, to the point, and usually get people to chuckle,  she said.  They make people laugh and think.  The self-taught artist started posting her comics online in March 2017. A year later, she\u2019s accumulated more than 145,000 followers on Instagram.  Fahmy has recently started reaching out to other Muslim women cartoonists on Instagram in an effort to elevate more women\u2019s voices. With these collaborations, she\u2019s hoping to highlight the themes of solidarity in sisterhood, fighting Islamophobia, and breaking misconceptions about women who wear the hijab.   One thing I hope my comics do for my audience is to make them more aware of the marginalized folk around them,  she said.  Awareness gives way to understanding, which gives way to empathy, which gives way to compassion. And the world could definitely use a little more compassion.

      "text": "It\u2019s always been clear that President Donald Trump views women as commodities, pretty objects to be bought and sold. After all, this is a man who owned a beauty contest, openly rates women by their looks, and feels empowered enough by his fame and wealth that he\u2019s allegedly committed, and openly bragged of, sexual assault. Still, the revelations around his alleged affairs with adult film star Stormy Daniels, who told her story in explicit detail on  60 Minutes  Sunday night, and former model Karen McDougal are instructive. In their broadest outlines, the affairs actually look a lot like workplace sexual harassment: Men leverage their power to get sex, manipulating women who are looking for opportunities and advancement. In addition to some outrageous strong-arm tactics and possible violations of federal election law, Daniels and McDougal\u2019s stories \u2015 as well as that of former  Apprentice  contestant Summer Zervos \u2015 are classic examples of sexual harassment. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, fell into a  casting couch  harassment trap, the outlines of which resemble tactics used by so many of the men recently exposed by the Me Too movement. The move isn\u2019t terribly original: A powerful (and typically older) man uses the possibility of a new job or acting role to get sex. It\u2019s a sexual harassment play out of Hollywood\u2019s Golden Era, long solidified in the workplace. Though exposed and condemned by the Me Too era, it has hardly gone out of fashion. According to Daniels\u2019 account, Trump invited her to dinner \u2015 without mentioning that they\u2019d be eating alone in his private hotel room. She was just 27 years old and, by all accounts, extremely bright and ambitious. He was 60 years old, married with a new baby at home and a lot of money. Trump then went about using his more powerful position to seduce Daniels with a career opportunity \u2015 a role on his show  The Celebrity Apprentice.  Unlike disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, whose tactics allegedly included physical assault, Trump didn\u2019t force Daniels. She submitted to sex with him because, she told Cooper on  60 Minutes,  she felt she had no real choice in the matter.  I realized exactly what I\u2019d gotten myself into,  she said.  I had it coming for making a bad decision for going to someone\u2019s room alone.  Daniels insisted on Sunday night that her encounter with Trump was consensual, but it\u2019s clear who had the upper hand.  In the months and weeks following their original meeting, Trump continued to dangle a slot on the TV show in order to get Daniels to meet up with him again, according to Daniels\u2019 account. (Trump, through spokespeople, has repeatedly denied the affair.) When she finally did \u2015 showing up to his private bungalow at the Beverly Hills hotel \u2015 she did not sleep with him again. The next month, he called to let her know the TV show thing wasn\u2019t happening.  One wonders if she would have nabbed the role if she had succumbed to sex again. Trump unleashed a similar play on Summer Zervos, according to a lawsuit filed by the former  Apprentice  contestant. Zervos was also looking for a career opportunity and gladly accepted Trump\u2019s dinner invitation in 2007. But when she arrived at the restaurant of the Beverly Hills hotel, she was directed to Trump\u2019s private bungalow, according to her complaint. When she got there, she says Trump kissed her and placed his hand on her breast. She declined his advances, pushing him away. But after that, she says she kept seeking Trump out for advice and job opportunities. Zervos is now suing the president for defamation \u2015 after he called her a liar.  These stories recall so many Me Too tales: the young woman who says she showed up at Charlie Rose\u2019s home to talk about a job and was greeted by the elderly TV host wearing a robe with nothing underneath. Or venture capitalist Justin Caldbeck, who allegedly propositioned women who were looking to him to invest in their startups.   Karen McDougal says she was manipulated in a similar fashion. In order to get her to sign away the right to tell the story of her alleged affair with Trump, American Media Inc. promised the former model essentially a fresh start in her career, according to the lawsuit she filed against AMI. (The White House has denied that the affair happened.) AMI owns The National Enquirer, along with Star and OK magazines. According to McDougal\u2019s lawsuit, AMI representatives told her she\u2019d have the opportunity to write several columns each month on health and beauty for the publications, and could also appear on magazine covers.  What model wouldn\u2019t want that,  McDougal told Anderson Cooper in an interview last week.  Especially as an older model like, you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, this is great right?\u2019   Not exactly. The columns and covers didn\u2019t happen. It\u2019s now clear the company was just trying to keep her quiet about her alleged affair.  This was a sex and power exchange of a slightly different order \u2015 since Trump\u2019s involvement is not quite clear. Still, at the end of the day, AMI appears to have used McDougal\u2019s ambition to manipulate her. Now McDougal is suing AMI to get out of the contract. This isn\u2019t about money for her, she said.  I\u2019m out to get my rights back, to prove a contract was illegal, that I was taken advantage of and go back to my life. Period.  Considering the amount of scrutiny these women now face, it\u2019s doubtful they\u2019ll ever quite be able to go back to their lives. And that\u2019s one of the many horrid ways women lose when they speak up about harassment.  The three women\u2019s stories also raise the possibility, of course, that there are more out there. About a dozen women have already accused Trump of sexual misconduct. Harassment stories have been a little more scarce, but Trump clearly has a playbook. It\u2019s doubtful that he only used it a few times. "

      "text": "Aly Raisman is not here for any victim blaming. The Olympic gymnast and sexual abuse survivor made it clear in a series of tweets on Sunday that she does not believe banning leotards from gymnastics will prevent future abuse in the sport.   I was recently asked if gymnasts should continue wearing leotards,  she tweeted.  Leotards [are] not the problem. The problem is the many pedophiles out there & the adults who enable them. By saying clothing is part of the issue, [you] are victim shaming/implying survivors should feel it\u2019s their fault.   Recently, Raisman has been at the center of the sexual abuse scandal involving former USA Gymnastics trainer Larry Nassar. Nassar sexually abused Raisman, along with hundreds of other young athletes, under the guise of medical treatment for over two decades.  The scandal has forced not only USA Gymnastics but other Olympic sports organizations to reckon with how they handle sexual abuse and how it can be prevented in the future.  Rasiman directed her Twitter followers to her recent campaign Flip the Switch to learn more about victim shaming and how to prevent child sexual abuse.  Female gymnasts\u2019 leotards weren\u2019t always so form-fitting, according to a 2016 deep-dive from Elle. In the 1930s and \u201940s, gymnasts wore loose-fitting leotards that had full butt coverage and often covered their shoulders. At that time, however, gymnastics was less physical and consisted mostly of dancing. As the sport progressed, the leotard became more form-fitting to accommodate larger muscles and more physical routines.  The 23-year-old has long-been a feminist advocate who\u2019s used her platform time and time again to call out slut shaming and victim blaming. In a 2017 Instagram post, Raisman posted a photo of herself in a bathing suit and reminded her followers that women don\u2019t need to cover up to be respected.   Wear whatever makes you feel happy and confident,  Raisman wrote.  Don\u2019t EVER let anyone tell you how you should or shouldn\u2019t dress. We are all entitled to wear what we want. Females do not have to dress modest to be respected.   "

      "text": "Last week, France announced a bill to its Council of Ministers that would allow some of the sexual misbehaviors and crimes brought to light in recent months to be more easily punishable by law. There are four sections of the legislation: First, street harassment would be punished on the spot with a fine anywhere from 90 to 750 euros. Second, the law would set the age of sexual consent to 15. Third, the limitation period for sexual crimes committed against minors would be extended to 30 years (up from 20 years) after the victim turns 18. Finally, there would be tougher sanctions against online group harassment (this means that any person who takes part in harassing someone online, even if they just sent a few tweets, will be considered responsible). Though the Harvey Weinstein scandal, France\u2019s #BalanceTonPorc movement, and the worldwide Me Too movement have clearly put more attention on sexual assault worldwide, behind each of these pieces of legislation exists a person or a story that began debates in France long before these issues became daily top news stories.   In 2012, a Belgian woman named Sofie Peeters released a documentary called  Woman of the Street.  Using a hidden camera, she recorded and denounced sexist remarks and behaviors that she heard from men while simply walking down the street. Insults such as  bitch  and  slut  rained down on her, as well as indecent behavior and propositions. The young woman, then a student, said she was surprised that she experienced this kind of harassment  5 to 10 times a day.  As the French website Madmoizelle noted, the video\u2019s widespread impact caused politicians around Europe to react. The city of Brussels, for example, decided shortly thereafter that this type of sexual harassment would be punishable by law. Last Wednesday, the French government joined Brussels by proposing the establishment of a fine for street harassment and sexist insults.   In October 2016, French television and radio presenter Flavie Flament revealed in her book The Consolation that she had been raped by a well-known photographer (though she didn\u2019t reveal his name in the book) almost 30 years before. She explained to the JDD, a French weekly newspaper, that she withheld her aggressor\u2019s identity because of the  justice of the limitation concerning this type of crime.    Today this man is legally out of reach, yet that does not make him innocent. I cannot pursue my tormentor and I will live with this for the rest of my days,  she said.  Now her focus is on fighting to extend the limitation period for crimes committed against minors. In France, the period is 20 years if the victim is an adult, and if the victim is a minor at the time of the incident, it is up to 20 years after the victim turns 18. Minors thus have until age 38 to file a case. This is not enough time for some victims, who may suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder or go years without realizing a crime they have suffered.  A victim of rape sometimes \u2018wakes up\u2019 many years after. For these people, coming out about what happened can take a long time. They may decide to pursue legal action after seeing a psychologist, which can be a long reconstructive effort,  explained Laure Ignace, a lawyer from the European Association Against Violence Directed at Women in the Workplace (AVWW), to the French paper Le Monde. Flament was given the task to work on extending the statute of limitations by Laurence Rossignol, the French minister of families, children and women\u2019s rights. She will also create a documentary,  Rape Against Minors,  to highlight the subject. Since then, nearly 30,000 people have signed a petition to extend the limitation period. In November 2017, Emmanuel Macron reiterated in his anti-violence against women proposal that the government should extend the period to 30 years for minors.   Concerning the age of consent for minors, the story that has created debates is rather recent, even if the subject itself is not. The acquittal of a man tried for the rape of an 11-year-old girl caused outrage in France in November 2017. Twenty years old at the time of the trial, the girl accused the man of rape, but the defendant stated it was consensual. He also asserted that she lied about her age, which she disputed. A similar affair sparked controversy in France two months earlier. A 28-year-old man was put on trial for  sexual abuse  and not  rape  after having sex with an 11-year-old. In France, punishment for the former is much lighter.  These two cases, particularly the one in November, raised numerous voices in favor of establishing an age of sexual consent, to distinguish the difference between children (those deemed unable to consent) and sexually consenting adults. Emannuel Macron asked for the age to be set to 15 during a speech on Nov. 27, 2017, shortly after the UN\u2019s International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women.  Marl\u00e8ne Schiappa, the Secretary of State for Equality between women and men has announced that, under a certain age, a minor should no longer be considered a consenting sexual adult.  Below a certain age, it should be considered that there can be no debate, ever, on the sexual consent of a child, and that for any child below a certain age, it would be automatically considered rape or sexual assault,  explains Schiappa, adding that this legal age could be somewhere  between 13 and 15.  Following a video on harassment published on Madmoizelle in May 2016, actress and YouTube personality Marion Seclin received a wave of insults and hate comments online. More than 40,000, according to Seclin. What was the reason for this surge of hate? The actress explained that the street was not a place to flirt.  It angered me that a large number of internet users decided not to debate with me, but come at me with insults. (...) I have received nearly 40,000 death and rape threats, people asking me to commit suicide, or threatening to kill my family, or other insults,  she later recounted. This case of online harassment brought to light the impunity available to harassers, as Seclin found herself destitute and with little possible recourse. In December 2017, she told her story at a TEDx conference and explained why she was  the French champion of cyberbullying.   Everything that happens online is happening in real life,  she said.  It\u2019s not me against 40,000 people, it\u2019s me against one person and one person and one person ... I do not have the time, nor the energy, nor the means to file a suit against 40,000 pseudonyms. Have you ever tried to file a case against someone? Do you know the administrative steps to file a case against someone in France? It is very long. So imagine 40,000 people,  she said during the talk, referring to the difficulty in pursuing legal action in France against cyberbullying. In February, a report from France\u2019s High Council of Equality between Women and Men (HCE) was submitted to the government with recommendations for ensuring cyberbullying would not go unpunished. In the bill, presented last Wednesday, a sanction appears that is related to the phenomenon of  mob mentality,  or when several people harass the same person together. The bill will still need to be voted on by French Parliament before it passes, but members of the French government are clearly trying to make major strides when it comes to protecting girls and women.

      "text": "(Reuters) - Remington Outdoor Co Inc., one of the largest U.S. makers of firearms, filed for bankruptcy protection on Sunday to carry out a debt-cutting deal with creditors amid mounting public pressure for greater gun control. The company listed assets in the range of $500 million to $1 billion and liabilities in the range of $500 million to $1 billion.  Remington, America\u2019s oldest gun maker, announced the deal in February to reduce its $950 million debtload in a deal that will transfer control of the company to creditors. The filing comes after a Feb. 14 shooting at a Parkland, Florida high school that killed 17 and spurred an intense campaign for gun control by activists. The massacre inspired hundreds of thousands of young Americans to lead huge U.S. anti-gun rallies on Saturday. In some of the biggest U.S. youth demonstrations for decades, protesters called on lawmakers and President Donald Trump to confront the issue. Voter registration activists fanned out in the crowds, signing up thousands of the nation\u2019s newest voters. Major U.S. companies and retailers have taken some steps to restrict firearm sales. Citigroup Inc said last week it will require new retail-sector clients to sell firearms only to customers who passed background checks and to bar sales of high-capacity magazines. Citi also said it was restricting sales for buyers under 21, a move adopted by other large retailers, while Kroger Co\u2019s superstore chain Fred Meyer said it will stop selling firearms entirely. Cerberus Capital Management LP, the private equity firm that controls Remington, will lose ownership in the bankruptcy. Remington\u2019s creditors, which sources told Reuters include Franklin Templeton Investments and JPMorgan Asset Management, will exchange their debt holdings for Remington equity. The creditors inked the debt-cutting deal prior to the Parkland shooting, and it is unclear if any have exited. The restructuring support agreement allows creditors to sell their holdings, but the buyer is bound by the deal. One investor told IFR, a Thomson Reuters news provider, that his firm had contemplated buying the Remington loans that will be exchanged into equity, which were offered at as low as 25 cents on the dollar.  We bowed out because we were uncomfortable,  he said. After a Remington Bushmaster rifle was used in the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in Connecticut in 2012 that killed 20 children and six adults, Cerberus tried unsuccessfully to sell Remington, then known as Freedom Group. Katie-Mesner Hage, an attorney representing Sandy Hook families in a lawsuit against Remington, said in a prepared statement that she did not expect the gun maker\u2019s bankruptcy would affect their case. Remington and other gunmakers have suffered from slumping sales in the past year as fears of stricter gun laws have faded. The chief executive of American Outdoor Brands Corp, maker of the Smith & Wesson gun used in the Parkland shooting, said on March 1 that some gun retailers reported increased sales after the Florida school shooting. Remington filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. "

      "text": "An evangelical Christian pastor has put forth a troubling suggestion for how to deal with the issues highlighted by sexual abuse survivors as part of the Me Too movement.  John Piper, an influential Baptist author and speaker and chancellor of a Christian college in Minnesota, claims that a return to traditional gender roles would help keep women safe from sexual abuse. Piper\u2019s definition of traditional gender roles involves women submitting to male leadership, and men accepting their God-given responsibility to protect these  weaker vessels.  This conservative Christian approach to gender relations is known as complementarianism.  In a recent podcast, Piper argued that society\u2019s departure from these traditional roles over the past 50 years has laid the groundwork for sexual abuse.  Egalitarian assumptions in our culture, and to a huge degree in the church, have muted \u2014 silenced, nullified \u2014 one of the means that God has designed for the protection and the flourishing of women,  Piper said, according a podcast transcript published on his website March 16. Complementarianism is not uncommon in conservative Christian circles. And Piper is not an outlier in American evangelicalism. In fact, he\u2019s scheduled to speak alongside some of the country\u2019s top evangelical leaders at a conference for pastors in Louisville, Kentucky, next month.  At the same time, Piper\u2019s claims have elicited strong criticism from some fellow Christians. Advocates for survivors of sexual abuse and their allies don\u2019t believe Piper\u2019s suggestion will bring about positive change. Indeed, they\u2019re worried this traditional way of thinking about women\u2019s roles is part of the problem. These advocates say Piper needs to do more to acknowledge the ways complementarian theology has been abused, especially in evangelical settings. Christa Brown, a clergy sex abuse survivor who blogs about abuse cover-ups in church settings, told HuffPost that Piper is endorsing a gender dynamic that can easily lead to exploitation and mistreatment. Many of the survivors she\u2019s worked with have told her they were  groomed  for abuse by a patriarchal theology that taught them to be submissive and obedient toward men.  Because complementarian theology promotes a power differential between men and women, it fosters the sort of abuse of power that devolves into sexual abuse,  Brown said. Piper\u2019s remarks were from an episode of his  Ask Pastor John  podcast, in which he fielded a question about the sexual abuse allegations that have emerged against several high-profile men as a result of the Me Too movement. Asked to share his thoughts on these abuse allegations, Piper responded by bringing up an age-old debate in Christian theology between two perspectives on gender relations \u2015 complementarianism and egalitarianism. In the complementarian view, men and women are equally treasured by God, but have distinct, divinely ordained roles. As spiritual heads of the household, men have final authority over women in both spiritual and practical matters. They are expected to exercise this authority in a self-sacrificial way \u2015 the way Christians believe Jesus gave his life for the church. Women, meanwhile, are expected to submit to their husbands at home, at church and, sometimes, in society. According to egalitarianism, however, neither men nor women are automatically granted headship. They are seen as spiritual equals in the eyes of God, and divide responsibilities based on their capabilities, rather than by gender. In his podcast, Piper claimed that egalitarianism is responsible for a breakdown of the structures that previously kept women safe. As more people embrace the idea that men and women are equal, he said, men have stopped feeling the need to  protect and honor  women. Piper argued that modern ideas of gender equality are actually partly to blame for the alleged abusive behavior of people like film producer Harvey Weinstein, comedian Louis C.K. and former Senate candidate Roy Moore.  It\u2019s a firm conviction of most of our egalitarian culture that men as men do not owe women a special kind of care and protection and honor that women do not owe men. I believe they do,  Piper said in the podcast.  I believe 50 years of denying it is one of the seeds bearing very bad fruit, including all those sexual abuses... talked about in [the listener\u2019s] question. There are other seeds in our culture, but this is one of the seeds.  Advocates for victims of abuse point out that theology emphasizing the authority of men has existed for centuries \u2015 but it\u2019s only since the advent of feminism and the emergence of Christian egalitarianism that Western society has progressed to a point where the abuse of women is understood to be unacceptable.   Piper references the last 50 years as the age of egalitarianism, and posits that it is the reason we are seeing sexual abuse happen,  Hannah Paasch, an ex-Christian blogger, told HuffPost in an email.  I would counter-point that sexual abuse has been happening for thousands of years, and the past 50 years of imagining alternate frameworks for gender and gender roles is in fact what has brought a centuries-old problem to light.  Paasch is one of the founders of #ChurchToo, a hashtag inspired by the Me Too movement that focuses on abuse in church settings. Paasch said she grew up immersed in evangelical culture, listening to Piper\u2019s sermons. She said that besides erasing the existence of trans and nonbinary people, complementariansim fails to take women\u2019s agency into account. It encourages men to decide what\u2019s best for women in a paternalistic manner. Ultimately, she believes, this theology  feeds the rape culture that we see permeating American Christianity today.    Perhaps in a perfect world men could protect women in a gentle and selfless manner, but that\u2019s just simply not what we see,  Paasch wrote.  When you hand one person a position of power over someone else \u2015 a position that they did not earn based on competency or merit but simply because of some attribute or descriptor they were assigned at birth \u2015 that power will inevitably be used for the person in power\u2019s benefit.  Piper has been criticized in the past for appearing to encourage evangelical women to  endure  abusive relationships for a season. He later clarified that he believes abusive husbands are  breaking God\u2019s law  and should be reported to civil authorities. Piper did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story. Ashley Easter is an advocate for victims of sexual abuse in church settings and the founder of the Courage Conference, an annual conference that brings survivors and advocates together. Easter told HuffPost that abuse is  always rooted in a lust for power, domination, and control.  She said she\u2019s never worked with a victim of abuse who did not experience some type of power asymmetry in the relationship.  The best way to defuse abuse is to instate an ethic of equality which upsets the power and control imbalance,  Easter told HuffPost in an email.  I have seen over and over again when these survivors found new equality-based relationships they were much safer and happier.  "

      "text": "Technology magnate Elon Musk apparently has a good reason for being angry with his estranged father: Errol Musk recently revealed that he had a child with his stepdaughter and he called the baby  God\u2019s plan.  The elder Musk told The Sunday Times of London this weekend that he fathered a son with 30-year-old Jana Bezuidenhout, the daughter of his former wife Heide. Jana \u2015 who is Elon\u2019s younger stepsister \u2015 was 4 years old when her mother wed Errol, a union that lasted 18 years before the pair got divorced. Errol, 72, told the publication that he did not look on Jana as his stepdaughter because she lived away from the family for the majority of her childhood. He also said they reconnected more recently after Jana had gone through a breakup.  We were lonely, lost people,  he said.  One thing led to another \u2014 you can call it God\u2019s plan or nature\u2019s plan.  Errol does not live with Jana and the boy, 10-month-old Elliot Rush Musk, but has referred to the baby as an  exquisite child  and Jana as a  delightful girl and a wonderful mother.   According to The Daily Mail, Elon went  berserk  when he learned about the pairing, which isn\u2019t particularly surprising. The SpaceX CEO referred to his father as  a terrible human being  in a Rolling Stone interview in November 2017. Another of Errol\u2019s children, his daughter Alexandra  Ali  Musk (pictured below on a happier occasion), was apparently also upset at the news. Errol told The Daily Mail that when he informed his family that the baby was his, he  thought [Ali] would be supportive and understanding.  Instead, Errol said that Ali called him  insane, mentally ill  and that now his family believes he\u2019s  getting senile and should go into an old age home, not have a life full of fun and a tiny baby.

      "text": "ATLANTA\u2014Sister Jean\u2019s Happy Ramblers are headed to the Final Four. Loyola Chicago defeated Kansas State 78-62 Saturday night in a South regional final that wasn\u2019t ever particularly close, but still a lot of fun for everyone not wearing purple. The Ramblers used a combination of surgical interior slices and backbreaking three-pointers to disrupt K-State from every angle, and the Wildcats had no reliable answer on either end of the court. Now, the unlikeliest story of the 2018 NCAA Tournament gets another chapter. Loyola began its second half against Nevada on Thursday night shooting an ungodly \u2013 wait, let\u2019s not use that word for Sister Jean\u2019s team; let\u2019s say  impressive  \u2013 13-for-13. The Ramblers followed that up by draining their first nine shots from the field on Saturday, kicked off by Cameron Krutwig. Sidelined much of Thursday night with foul trouble, Krutwig threw his beef into the fray Saturday night, thundering for seven crucial points and five rebounds at the half. On the other end of the spectrum, Kansas State couldn\u2019t get anything started on offense, and couldn\u2019t slow Loyola on defense. Barry Brown Jr. was a slashing marvel, and Xavier Sneed filled the hoop from outside, but they were the lone highlights from the KSU side. The Wildcats couldn\u2019t catch up to Loyola\u2019s slash-and-pass game, and even on the rare instances when K-State could force Loyola into turnovers, the deficit didn\u2019t shrink to any less than five. The score at the half: Loyola 36, K-State 24. The teams traded baskets early in the second half, a time when trading baskets simply would not do for K-State. The minutes shrank and the deficit didn\u2019t. The key moment, emotionally speaking, came with just under 17 minutes remaining in the game. Krutwig kicked the ball out to Richardson beyond the arc; K-State\u2019s Kamau Stokes charged out toward him, but couldn\u2019t get there before Richardson released the ball, and couldn\u2019t stop after. Three-point bucket, and-1 shot Richardson lay on the floor and spread out his arms and legs, starfish style, a broad grin on his face. And the hits kept on coming. A Donte Ingram two-pointer got changed to a three during an official timeout; Loyola was so good at scoring it was putting points on the board even during commercials. Krutwig rolled in an ugly-but-still-good layup, Custer hit a long three-pointer, and Ingram sliced right through the bewildered K-State defense for an up-and-under bucket, and suddenly Loyola was up by 19 with 14 minutes remaining, and even the most pessimistic of souls started to dare to hope. The chants of  L-U-C!  from the Gryffindor-scarved Rambler faithful grew louder and louder as K-State\u2019s hopes of a miracle comeback grew dimmer and dimmer. Kansas State\u2019s offensive sets fell into a depressing pattern of one-shot-and-gone; at the other end of the court, Loyola seemed able to finger-roll in featherlight shots from anywhere on the court. The deficit was a wall too high to climb. Even when Kansas State put together a 10-0 run with about five minutes left in the game, the Wildcats were still down 13. Richardson halted that run with another three-pointer, his sixth of the night on seven shots, and K-State\u2019s shoulders visibly sagged. And when Stokes\u2019 own attempt at a clutch three ringed the hoop and inexplicably popped out: \u2026well, that was about it for the Wildcats. Loyola began stretching the floor and devouring clock, and Kansas State could only foul and hope. Kansas State can look back on this tournament with pride, having knocked off one of the nation\u2019s marquee programs in Kentucky on Thursday night. But Loyola\u2019s got a lot more to look forward to. We\u2019re not through with you yet, Sister Jean.   Read more from Yahoo Sports: This story was originally published on Yahoo Sports. "

      "text": "In the weeks leading up to the 2017 Women\u2019s March, thousands of people knitted pink yarn hats, dubbed the  pussy hat,  as a symbol of solidarity for protestors across the world united in a quest for equality. And this weekend, at the March 24 March for our Lives events scheduled to take place in Washington, D.C., and in cities across the country \u2014 where protesters will encourage lawmakers to enact more sensible gun-violence prevention legislation \u2014 there may also be pussy hats. But the headlining accessory this time around is a pair of knit gloves with  evil eyes  sewn into the palms. Krista Suh, who created the Pussyhat Project, spearheaded this initiative for the upcoming gun control march, inspired by the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. Her goal is to collect 438 pairs of gloves, to represent the 438 people killed or injured in school shootings from 2014 through today.  Individually, to show the eye on the palm, you can put out your hand in a \u2018stop\u2019 gesture \u2014 as in we must stop gun violence; enough is enough. In a group, you can raise your hands above your head to show the eyes \u2014 this is the universal gesture of \u2018hands up don\u2019t shoot\u2019 and a reminder of how vulnerable our children are in a country with weak gun control,  Suh\u2019s website reads. She says it\u2019s in perfect in alignment with women\u2019s issues, a cause she felt passionately about after the 2016 presidential election.  Women\u2019s rights are human rights, and there are a lot of issues specific to women \u2014 elder care, health care, and yes, gun control. We are mothers, students, and teachers, so I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any issue that is off limits for women to advocate for,  she tells Yahoo Lifestyle. While the meaning behind the  pussy hat  is more easily deconstructed \u2014 both a nod to President Trump\u2019s comments about grabbing women and to the cat ears knitted into the headwear \u2014 the evil eye gloves are perhaps less obvious in their symbolism.  The evil eye is the symbol of protection, just like the pussy hat was a symbol of protection for women who went to [Washington] D.C. to march,  Suh explains.  These eyes are meant to show that people are watching \u2014 history is watching \u2014 what Congress will do next. I think it\u2019s really powerful.  Of course, not everyone offered glowing endorsements of those pink hats. They were called vulgar, pointless, and gender normative. As of yet, the evil eye gloves haven\u2019t caused as loud a stir, likely because they\u2019ve been a recurring motif in fashion for years. On Fall 2016 runways, for instance, Givenchy and Alexander McQueen both showed collections with evil eyes and the Eye of Horus on garments and accessories. There are entire sections on retailers\u2019 websites devoted to evil eye jewelry.  If you\u2019re going to talk about the evil eye, you\u2019ve also got to talk about hands,  wrote Racked in 2016.  The hamsa hand may be the most popular \u2014 and ancient \u2014 protective symbol against the evil eye. An open hand with an eye in the palm, this design has origins in the Babylonian Empire as an emblem of its goddess, Inanna. \u2026 Cultures the world over agreed on one thing: This amulet embodied female power.  So maybe those knit gloves do make sense.  As for whether protest fashion encourages  slacktivism  \u2014 the idea that throwing on a T-shirt with the slogan of any given cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre replaces measurable political action \u2014 Suh, for obvious reasons, isn\u2019t so harsh to those who aren\u2019t ready to run for office but might be ready to knit a pair of gloves.  Clothing items are symbolic, but they\u2019re also a gateway to larger action,  Suh says.  Also, it\u2019s important to let people know they\u2019re not alone \u2014 that they don\u2019t have to work in a vacuum when other people are visible and brave enough to show themselves.

Artist Kristen Visbal is selling two-foot reproductions of the famous statue of a young girl facing off against Wall Street\u2019s  Charging Bull.  The miniature reproductions each cost a whopping $6,500 and will be sold as a limited edition, with only 1,000 made in total.  My hope is that your limited edition bronze will serve as a symbol of empowerment and encouragement and as a reminder that collaboration between genders and culture is the enlightened path forward for smarter, stronger decisions,  Visbal wrote on the Fearless Girl website.  According to the website, 20 percent of the proceeds from sales of the statues will go to nonprofits that support women\u2019s education and gender equality.  The original statue was erected last March in New York City by asset management group State Street Global Advisors to  increase gender diversity  and celebrate women leaders in business. In October 2017, it was revealed by the Department of Labor that State Street Global had paid women and black executives less than their white male counterparts. State Street Global Advisors agreed to pay $5 million back to over 300 women and 15 black employees.  While the statue ended up being another empty feminist symbol created by capitalism, the statue was a hit with many people and created conversations about female empowerment in different workspaces.  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio commended Visbal and the statue last March:  In her short time here, the Fearless Girl has fueled powerful conversations about women in leadership and inspired so many.   Although the statue is pricy, Visbal told CNN Money that she\u2019s considering selling smaller reproductions at a more affordable price. The current model will be sold in a  butterscotch brown  color with a base made of black granite. The production time to create a reproduction will take three to four months.

      "text": "Former Vice President Joe Biden was speaking at a rally against sexual violence on Tuesday night when he said he would have  beat the hell out of  President Donald Trump in high school for the way he treats women.  It was an odd sentiment, though Biden\u2019s comments were met with laughter and applause from the crowd. And, of course, Trump responded.   Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy. Actually, he is weak, both mentally and physically, and yet he threatens me, for the second time, with physical assault,  Trump tweeted Thursday morning.  He doesn\u2019t know me, but he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way. Don\u2019t threaten people Joe!  As most things on the internet do, the feud \u2015 between two grown men over 70 years old, might I add \u2015 was retweeted, turned into a meme and quickly went viral. People on both sides of the aisle defended their party\u2019s politician and dragged his opponent.  While I welcome any non-lady feud, there\u2019s something troubling about the root of Biden\u2019s and Trump\u2019s comments. Biden boasted about beating up the president while he was at a rally against sexual violence for his organization It\u2019s On Us. He later bizarrely suggested that men who treat women poorly are likely to be physically unattractive, essentially fat-shaming Trump.  Biden declined to comment further on his remarks through a spokesman. Trump\u2019s response \u2015 specifically pointing out that Biden is  weak  both  mentally and physically  \u2015 is a clear sign that Trump felt his masculinity was threatened by Biden\u2019s remarks. Both comments are peak toxic masculinity: Biden attempted to defend the honor of women with his brawny man strength and Trump responded to violence with more violence.  This macho rhetoric is, in fact, the root cause of the very issue Biden is campaigning against with It\u2019s On Us. Responding to violence against women with more violence is wildly problematic. This feud, but specifically Biden\u2019s initial comments, are exemplary of how men feel they need to prove themselves through violent or sexual acts to be seen as  real men.   Toxic masculinity \u2015 the concept that men are confined to strict gender roles that perpetuate violent and overly sexualized behavior \u2015 is often the very reason for rampant sexual violence on college campuses and around the country.  When Biden essentially challenges Trump to a duel, he perpetuates the myth that women need good guys to protect them from the bad guys. In fact, what all sexual assault survivors need, but especially women, is to be seen as humans. Once women are seen as equals, they can no longer be used as objects men can consume haphazardly to make them look more manly to other men.  It\u2019s safe to say that Trump\u2019s track record with women is much worse than Biden\u2019s. The president, who once bragged about grabbing women  by the pussy,  has been accused of sexual misconduct, ranging from harassment to assault and rape, by 21 women. Trump regularly denies allegations of sexual and domestic abuse against not only him but also his former staffers as  fake news.  Biden has a somewhat storied history with his treatment of women. The former vice president, who launched It\u2019s On Us with President Barack Obama in 2014, has long advocated for women\u2019s rights, including drafting the Violence Against Women Act of 1994. He has, however, been widely criticized for how he handled professor Anita Hill\u2019s accusations of sexual harassment against Clarence Thomas during the latter\u2019s 1991 Supreme Court confirmation hearings. Many people believe that Biden, who was then chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, didn\u2019t do enough to ensure those allegations were given full consideration. More recently, Biden has taken on the good old  Uncle Joe  persona, during which time he has been caught on camera being creepy and borderline inappropriate toward women.  While Biden\u2019s behavior toward women is nowhere near that of Trump\u2019s, his recent actions call into question his understanding of rape culture and the root cause of sexual violence on college campuses. I think I can speak for most women when I say: Please, men, don\u2019t use women and our bodies as a pawn to boost your ego.  "

      "text": "Years-old sexual abuse allegations against a former Mormon missionary leader were published on a whistleblowing website this week, prompting a public pledge from the Utah-based church that it would discipline the alleged perpetrator if the claims were found to be true. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints said in a statement Tuesday that it is looking into  deeply disturbing  allegations against Joseph Bishop, who served as president of a Mormon missionary training center in Provo, Utah, in the 1980s.  A 55-year-old woman has accused Bishop of sexually assaulting her in 1984 while she was training to be a missionary. The woman claims Bishop raped her at the center, according to a Brigham Young University police report obtained by HuffPost. The woman\u2019s name has not been disclosed in the press or in the police report. Bishop was the president at the Missionary Training Center (MTC) in Provo from 1983 to 1986. An MTC is where the LDS church trains thousands of young men and women before they are sent out as missionaries to countries across the world.   If the allegations of sexual assault are true, it would be a tragic betrayal of our standards and would result in action by the Church to formally discipline any member who was guilty of such behavior, especially someone in a position of trust,  the church said in its statement. The church\u2019s statement came days after a taped conversation between Bishop and the woman was posted to MormonLeaks, a website started by ex-Mormons seeking to increase transparency within the LDS church. Last December, the woman posed as a reporter and secretly recorded an interview she had with Bishop in Arizona. During the wide-ranging conversation, she asked Bishop questions about the alleged assault and about other women he may have harassed. The Mormon leader, who is now 85 years old, can be heard saying he doesn\u2019t remember assaulting the woman and muses that maybe it\u2019s  because my mind doesn\u2019t want me to remember that.  At one point in the interview, the woman asked if Bishop molested another Mormon woman at the MTC. He admits that he gave one woman a back rub that got too  frisky.  He apologizes repeatedly in the recording and says that for years he has struggled with a  sexual addiction.     I am very, very sorry and I am so sorry. I don\u2019t know if I can even be forgiven on your side,  Bishop tells the woman in the recording. The woman also contacted Brigham Young University police in November to report her alleged assault. According to that police report, Bishop denied the rape allegations but told detectives that he\u2019d gone with the woman to a small  preparation room  and while talking with her  asked her to show him her breasts, which she did.   BYU police relayed the facts of the case to the Utah County attorney\u2019s office. Deputy attorney David Sturgill replied that he could not pursue criminal charges against Bishop because the statute of limitations had expired four years after the alleged assault.   I have no reason to doubt the victim\u2019s disclosure, and would have likely prosecuted Mr. Bishop, but for the expiration of the statute of limitations,  Sturgill informed BYU police, according to the police report. BYU police closed their investigation into the assault on Dec. 23.  The woman told the LDS church-owned Deseret News that she first reported the assault to church officials around 1988. The church\u2019s official statement on Tuesday claimed officials became aware of the alleged assault in 2010, when the woman informed leaders of a Mormon congregation in Pleasant Grove, Utah, where she was living.  The LDS church claims the leaders  listened carefully to the claims being made  and then relayed them to the Pleasant Grove Police Department. The church claims it received no further communication from the police about the matter. Church leaders also contacted Bishop, who denied the allegations. Unable to verify the woman\u2019s claims, the church said it decided not to discipline Bishop at the time. According to The Salt Lake Tribune, the woman made a threat about killing Bishop in 2010. Pleasant Grove police interviewed the woman and decided not to make an arrest. In January, the woman\u2019s lawyer forwarded the recorded conversation to the LDS church. The church claims both the woman and Bishop were then interviewed about the allegations. Both parties reaffirmed their positions and appeared to have  dramatically  different recollections of what happened in 1984. Bishop\u2019s family claims that the woman who made the accusations is untrustworthy and has falsely accused other men of sexual assault. His son, Greg Bishop, said his father was confused during the woman\u2019s interview, since he was recovering from a heart surgery that took place two days earlier. The son added that when his father admitted to having a  sexual addiction,  he was referring to a lifelong battle with  controlling  his  sexual thoughts.   Those people who know dad don\u2019t put much credence in these allegations,  Greg Bishop told the AP. The church cautioned in its statement that it does not have the  investigative tools  available to law enforcement agencies to conduct a thorough review of the matter, but pledged to keep Bishop accountable for any misconduct.  The Church is continuing its investigation of this individual\u2019s claims and will act consistent with its long-standing policy of no tolerance for abuse.  "

      "text": "The only woman candidate for Maryland governor shows herself breastfeeding her child in a new campaign ad. Krish Vignarajah, one of eight Democrats vying to challenge GOP incumbent Gov. Larry Hogan in this year\u2019s elections, uses the 30-second ad to highlight Maryland\u2019s lack of women in statewide or federal offices. A woman in an elected position isn\u2019t just about representation, she says in the ad.  It\u2019s about policy. States with women in government have better schools, better health care, lower incarceration rates. I want all of that for Maryland,  Vignarajah tells viewers. Vignarajah is at least the second gubernatorial candidate in this year\u2019s elections to feature breastfeeding in campaign advertising \u2015 a strong statement that women can be mothers and have prominent public-service careers. Kelda Roys, a Democratic candidate for Wisconsin governor, began running ads this month that show her breastfeeding. Vignarajah\u2019s ad goes on to talk of her parents who immigrated to America with $200, and how she became policy director for former first lady Michelle Obama.   Some say no man can beat Larry Hogan,  Vignarajah says in the ad.  Well, I\u2019m no man. I\u2019m a mom. I\u2019m a woman. And I want to be your next governor.   Hogan is only the second Republican to be Maryland\u2019s governor in nearly 50 years, and his approval ratings have been high.  Roys\u2019 ad in Wisconsin strikes a note similar to Vignarajah\u2019s.  I am a mom, and that\u2019s a big reason why I am motivated to run for governor. I cannot have my children growing up in a world where we don\u2019t value public education and we are destroying natural resources,  Roys says.  What sets me apart from the rest of the field is not that I have a baby, but I have a track record of getting things done, of accomplishing progressive policies for people of this state.  The movement to normalize breastfeeding continues to gain momentum, with some big-name celebrities also spotlighting the act. "

      "text": "YouTube is tightening restrictions on videos featuring firearms and accessories, entering the intensifying gun control debate. The move, announced this week, has already been condemned by some firearm enthusiasts as overreaching censorship. Others applauded the company \u2015 the world\u2019s largest video platform \u2015 for taking a stand in the wake of last month\u2019s Parkland, Florida, high school massacre. YouTube, a division of Alphabet Inc.\u2019s Google, outlined the new guidelines on its website Monday without fanfare. Bloomberg was first to report the shift on Wednesday. Under the new rules, to be enforced starting in April, YouTube will prohibit videos that link to sites selling firearms or gun accessories. Instructional videos containing information about how to build guns also will be restricted. A YouTube spokeswoman told The Wall Street Journal the company several years ago banned videos explicitly promoting the sale of firearms, but recently decided to expand the restrictions.  We routinely make updates and adjustments to our enforcement guidelines across all of our policies,  the spokeswoman said.  YouTube in October began removing videos showing how to modify firearms with bump stocks following the massacre in Las Vegas that left 58 people dead and hundreds injured. The shooter used the gun attachment on his rifles, allowing him to fire much more quickly. A cursory search on Thursday revealed tens of millions of videos on YouTube teaching viewers how to make guns (both real and toy varieties) and firearm accessories like silencers. The expanded restrictions are provoking an outcry from gun advocates, according to conservative media outlets. Some accused the site of  Big Brother  censorship, while others criticized the guidelines as vague.  Their policies are not very clear-cut and they are arbitrary,  Karl Kasada, co-owner of InRange TV, a YouTube channel featuring firearm videos, told the Journal.  You never know when you are going to get hit by them.  InRange TV said on Facebook this week that the channel will be moving its content to the porn website PornHub following YouTube\u2019s change.  PornHub has a history of being a proactive voice in the online community, as well as operating a resilient and robust video streaming platform,  InRange TV\u2019s post said.  YouTube posted its policy change less than a week before March For Our Lives, a gun control rally organized by survivors of the Parkland massacre. More than a half-million people are expected to attend the protest Saturday in Washington and in other cities.  "

Toys R Us filed for bankruptcy in September. In a tweet, the company announced Lazarus\u2019 death, saying there had been  many sad moments  recently but none more upsetting than the death of its founder. Lazarus founded Toys R Us in June 1957, nine years after he opened his first baby furniture and toy store in Washington, D.C., called Children\u2019s Bargain Town. After nearly a decade running Children\u2019s Bargain Town, Lazarus restructured his business, decided to focus solely on toys and reformatted the store to take after a supermarket, so customers could see open shelves of toys and place desired items in shopping carts. In the \u201980s, Toys R Us went international, opening locations all over the world. During the company\u2019s closing announcement last week, administrators for the retailer said it planned to close all 75 stores in the U.K. The widespread shutdowns will affect roughly 3,000 employees in the U.K., and about 31,000 in the U.S. There are 791 remaining Toys R Us locations in America. The company had about $5 billion in long-term debt when it filed for bankruptcy in September. When Toys R Us first entered Chapter 11, it had an ambitious plan to restructure and reemerge a healthy business. But after a weak holiday season performance coupled with intense competition from rivals including Amazon, Target and Walmart seemed to do the company in, according to USA Today. Lazarus had no stake in Toys R Us at the time of his death, CNN reported, but the toy industry titan served as CEO of the business until 1994.  In a statement to HuffPost, a Toys R Us spokesperson reiterated the sadness the company felt after Lazarus\u2019 death, adding,  He visited us in New Jersey just last year and we will forever be grateful for his positive energy, passion for the customer and love for children everywhere.

      "text": "Former professional hockey player Larry Kwong died this past Thursday at age 94 in Calgary, Canada.  The Chinese-Canadian athlete, the son of Chinese immigrants, was a pioneer in his sport, becoming the first person of color to play in the National Hockey League.   I broke the ice a little bit,  Kwong told The New York Times in 2013.  Maybe being the first Chinese player in the N.H.L. gave more of a chance for other Chinese boys that play hockey.  Kwong played just one major league game with the New York Rangers on March 13, 1948, after being called up from the New York Rovers farm team, and battled racism and discrimination on his way to the NHL.  The hockey player was born in Vernon, British Columbia, in 1923, the year Canada passed the Chinese Immigration Act. The legislation, enacted during a time of fierce anti-Chinese sentiment across the country, essentially banned all forms of Chinese immigration and wasn\u2019t repealed for more than two decades. Kwong, whose parents ran a grocery store, quickly became aware of the racism in the country. Chinese-Canadians were denied the right to vote, Kwong couldn\u2019t find a job in his hometown, and barbers even refused to cut his hair because of his ethnicity.  When I was a young boy, I couldn\u2019t just go to any barber shop. They won\u2019t take me because I was Chinese. It didn\u2019t make me feel good,  Kwong recalled, according to CHBC.  It made me feel that I can\u2019t just go to a certain place or restaurant. I would have to make sure they don\u2019t mind and let me go in.   Hockey became an escape for Kwong, The New York Times mentioned. And he joined his first organized team, the Vernon Hydrophones, in the late 1930s. He later moved up to the Trail Smoke Eaters, a team that promised its players a high-paying gig at a local smelter. The Chinese-Canadian player, however, was denied the job due to his heritage and was instead given work as a hotel bellhop.  Kwong was drafted into the military during World War II, playing hockey to entertain the troops while also building minesweepers in the shipyard. Later on, a scout finally noticed Kwong\u2019s talent for the sport at a Rangers tryout camp and Kwong landed a spot on the Rovers.  Though Kwong became the team\u2019s top scorer in his second year with the team, he witnessed many other players get called up to the Rangers before him, The Globe and Mail noted. When he finally got the chance to play for the major league team, he was given just one minute on the ice.   Just a minute. So what can you do in a minute? Unless you\u2019re a real magician, what can you do in a minute?  he told the Multicultural History Society of Ontario.  Kwong left the NHL at the end of the season but continued playing several successful years in the Quebec Senior Hockey League and later overseas.  After his sports career, he returned to his family\u2019s grocery business, retiring in 1996. Kwong\u2019s legacy in the sports world was solidified by his 2010 induction into the B.C. Hockey Hall of Fame and his 2013 induction in to the B.C. Sports Hall of Fame in Vancouver, among many other accolades. The pioneer is survived by a sister, daughter and two grandchildren.  "

      "text": "The winter-weary can get their fill of sun and surf at Broadway\u2019s Marquis Theatre, where the Jimmy Buffett jukebox musical,  Escape to Margaritaville,  opened to an enthusiastic (and woozy) crowd last week. It\u2019s easy to dismiss the Caribbean-themed show \u2013 which features the Buffett classics  It\u2019s Five O\u2019Clock Somewhere,   Cheeseburger in Paradise  and, of course,  Margaritaville  \u2013 as escapist fantasy. But one of the stars, Lisa Howard, believes audiences who dig a little deeper in the sand will discover a heartfelt message of empowerment and body positivity. The singer-actress plays Tammy, a beleaguered bride-to-be who accompanies her best friend, Rachel (Alison Luff), to an island resort for a bachelorette week filled with stiff cocktails and sinewy men. With each tropical sunset, however, Tammy questions whether she\u2019ll be content marrying her uncouth fianc\u00e9 (Ian Michael Stuart) as she falls for a sweet-natured bartender, Brick (Eric Petersen). True to Broadway musical tradition, Tammy\u2019s inevitable self-discovery features a great dress, a high-flying solo number and, of course, a happy ending.    She really ends up finding her self-worth,  Howard told HuffPost.  You see her go on that journey. I think it\u2019s important to be telling stories that empower women, especially nowadays, because it hasn\u2019t always been the case. The more examples we, as artists, can show in the world, and the women see that reflected in art, the more empowered they\u2019ll feel to speak out, say something, make a statement and stand up for themselves.  Buffett, Howard said, was a  great presence  throughout the development of the show.  It\u2019s been a pleasure to get to know him,  she explained.  He\u2019s kind of like you\u2019d think he\u2019d be. He\u2019s very chill, but he\u2019s a very smart, passionate businessman. He\u2019s taken this idea \u2015 this culture of island life \u2015 and run with it.   Howard boasts an enviable theatrical r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that includes  South Pacific  and  Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.  The Akron, Ohio, native\u2019s film career got a significant boost in 2012, when she appeared as a vampire in  The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn \u2013 Part 2.  The secret to her success, she said, has been picking roles written for plus-sized women like herself that don\u2019t hinge on a weight-loss narrative and aren\u2019t intended as comic relief. She said opportunities for plus-sized stars have expanded in both film and theater in the 18 years since she made her Broadway debut in  The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee.  (Witness, for example, Keala Settle\u2019s breakout turn in the movie musical  The Greatest Showman,  which turned out to be a surprise hit this winter.)   I\u2019ve just been blessed to have been a part of projects where my looks or my size don\u2019t matter,  Howard, who also is a plus-size fashion model, said.  These are lead roles I\u2019m playing. I\u2019m not just the funny sidekick or the character actor. \u2026 The diversity of the actual population, I feel, is being more represented. I\u2019m glad that I\u2019m a part of that.  Howard is best known for the 2015 Broadway musical,  It Shoulda Been You,  in which she played a wallflower bridesmaid who takes her romantic fate into her own hands as her sister\u2019s wedding plans unravel. Many critics saw the comedy, directed by  Frasier  veteran David Hyde Pierce, as a breakout moment for Howard. Her sultry song,  Jenny\u2019s Blues,  was one of the show\u2019s highlights, and has become popular on the cabaret circuit. Watch Howard perform  Jenny\u2019s Blues  on the 2015 Tony Awards below.   It Shoulda Been You  gave Howard a signature tune, but the musical struggled to find an audience and closed after just 135 performances. That experience, however, forced her to explore new, less-heralded realms. She was invited to read for a workshop version of  Escape to Margaritaville  soon afterward.  I don\u2019t fit into anyone else\u2019s mold,  said Howard, who names Mama Rose in  Gypsy  as a dream role.  Sometimes it\u2019s just a matter of persistence. You say yes to every opportunity, and keep putting yourself out there, so that people recognize what you have to offer, and where you fit in.   Regardless of how  Escape to Margaritaville  fares with critics, Howard hopes Buffett fans, or  Parrot Heads,  will take the time to check out the musical.  In spite of the craziness in the world right now, I hope they come [to the show] to escape, relax and enjoy a good love story,  she said.  You can take with you no matter what you do.  Lisa Howard stars in  Escape to Margaritaville,  now playing in New York.  CORRECTION: The original version of this article misspelled Ian Michael Stuart\u2019s surname.  "

      "text": "After a riotous week full of revelations that Facebook enabled a shadowy British firm called Cambridge Analytica to harvest and exploit the personal information of more than 50 million users \u2015 then failed to follow up on it for more than two years \u2015 CEO Mark Zuckerberg offered an off-camera act of contrition Wednesday, yet no apology. In the missive, Zuckerburg acknowledged there\u2019s been  a breach of trust  between Facebook and its users. He outlined several steps he hopes will restore public trust in the company, all aimed at clarifying and restricting which apps have access to which types of data. Facebook also said it will investigate the apps on the platform that had access to large amounts of user data prior to 2014, before the company began limiting developers\u2019 access. It plans to ban those found to be in violation of Facebook\u2019s terms and notify affected users, including those affected by Cambridge Analytica.  We have a responsibility to protect your data, and if we can\u2019t then we don\u2019t deserve to serve you,  wrote Zuckerberg, who is scheduled to appear in an interview on CNN Wednesday night. Notably, while Zuckerberg acknowledges Facebook made  mistakes,  his post stops short of anything resembling an apology.  Zuckerberg also failed to clarify how, exactly, Cambridge Analytica held onto and kept using the harvested data for a full two years after Facebook learned Cambridge had acquired it. He does offer the feeble defense that Facebook asked for, and received, a formal certification from the company verifying it deleted the data, but it was clearly insufficient.  In a separate post, Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg went a step further, stating she  deeply regrets  how Facebook handled Cambridge Analytica \u2015 but again, it\u2019s no apology.  You deserve to have your information protected \u2015 and we\u2019ll keep working to make sure you feel safe on Facebook,  she wrote.  Your trust is at the core of our service. We know that and we will work to earn it.  It\u2019s been a response several days in the making, as neither Zuckerberg nor Sandberg offered so much as a peep earlier this week as the allegations piled up and Facebook\u2019s stock tanked. Both were absent from an internal briefing about the situation Tuesday (though they were never scheduled to appear in the first place). And while Zuckerberg was expected to speak at an all-hands meeting Friday, it seems that\u2019s been bumped up a day or two. Translation of Zuckerberg\u2019s Wednesday post: He is super serious, you guys. This time, he promises it\u2019ll be different. Not like last time, in September, when he appeared before cameras and pledged Facebook would do a better job self-regulating and  create a new standard for transparency in online political ads.  (That particular acknowledgment was only prompted by the revelation that more than half of all eligible voters in the U.S. were exposed to and interacted with Russian propaganda on Facebook between June 2015 and August 2017.) Or the time before that, in July 2017, when a Facebook spokesperson flat-out told CNN  we have seen no evidence that Russian actors bought ads on Facebook in connection with the election.  (Just two weeks later, Facebook revealed it had found more than 3,000 such ads, bought and paid for by a Russian group known as the Internet Research Agency.) Or the time before that, in November 2016, when Zuckerberg dismissed as  crazy  the idea that misinformation, spread via Facebook, could have  influenced the election in any way.  (Then-President Barack Obama reportedly pulled Zuckerberg aside a couple of days after he made the statement and warned he should take the threat of disinformation on the network seriously. About a year after Obama\u2019s warning, Zuckerberg wrote a mea culpa saying he regretted the statement.  This is too important an issue to be dismissive,  he said.) Or the time before that, during the first Democratic primary of 2016, when Roger McNamee, an early Facebook investor, said he warned Zuckerberg and Sandberg that people were being manipulated on the platform \u2015 yet his concerns went unheeded.  They treated it like a public relations problem, rather than a substantive issue for the business,  he said, in a statement that\u2019s just as relevant today as it was then. Facebook has forcefully argued it\u2019s fine policing itself since at least 2011, when the Federal Election Commission first considered regulating political ads on the platform, then backed down after being warned by company lawyers not to  stand in the way of innovation.   Making you angry, making you afraid, is really good for Facebook\u2019s business,  McNamee said previously.  It is not good for America. It\u2019s not good for the users of Facebook.  This post has been updated with Sandberg\u2019s Wednesday statement and more background on Facebook\u2019s history.  "

      "text": "An evangelical Christian pastor who previously confessed to a  sexual incident  with a teenager 20 years ago has admitted that his past conduct was not only  immoral,  but also an  abuse of power.  Tennessee pastor Andy Savage made the remarks in a statement announcing his official resignation from Memphis\u2019 Highpoint Church on Tuesday. Savage had been on a leave of absence from the megachurch since January while an investigation was conducted into his ministry. Jules Woodson, the woman who went public with allegations of sexual abuse against the pastor in early January, had criticized Savage for calling it a  sexual incident.  Highpoint Church also faced backlash after members were seen giving Savage a standing ovation after he read out an apology letter during a church service that month.  When Jules cried out for justice, I carelessly turned the topic to my own story of moral change, as if getting my own life in order should help to make up for what she went through and continues to go through,  Savage wrote in Tuesday\u2019s statement.  I agree with Jules that, of all places, we as the Church should be getting this right.  Woodson says she was abused in 1998 when she was 17 years old, after an event at Woodlands Parkway Baptist Church in Texas, where Savage was serving as a youth pastor. She said the pastor, who was 22 at the time, drove her to a private location and forced her to perform sexual acts. Afterwards, leaders at the Texas church urged Woodson to keep quiet about what had happened to her and promised to address the matter internally. Savage resigned from his position at the church and moved to Memphis, where he was later hired by Highpoint. Highpoint Church said its leadership was aware of Savage\u2019s past with Woodson before hiring him. The Woodlands Parkway church in Texas later changed its name to StoneBridge Church. Larry Cotton, a former pastor at the church, was involved in the initial investigation into Savage\u2019s actions 20 years ago. Cotton resigned from his position at an Austin church in February. Savage wrote that during his recent leave of absence, he\u2019s come to see that  many wrongs occurred  in Woodson\u2019s case \u2015 the first being his  inappropriate relationship,  which he said could not have come from  mutual consent.  Savage wrote that the relationship was  not only immoral, but meets the definition of abuse of power since I was her youth pastor.  He wrote that there was also a  failure to follow due process  and give Woodson the investigation and proper response she deserved.  Admittedly, at 22 and in my first job, I truly believed that I was being guided through proper steps for restitution, which included resigning my position and moving from Houston to Memphis,  Savage wrote.  Those steps seemed significant at the time, and I trusted in the process assigned to me. Only through my recent time of reflection have I realized that more should have been done.  Texas has a law against clergy sexual assault, but the case against Savage is beyond the statute of limitations, according to The New York Times. Savage said he is stepping away from ministry now to  do everything I can to right the wrongs of the past.  Highpoint also announced on Tuesday that an investigation into Savage\u2019s ministry has been completed. Scott Fredricks, a lawyer with the Texas-based firm Cantey Hanger, led the investigation. Fredricks told HuffPost in January that he would study  the church\u2019s actions with respect to Andy Savage\u2019s ministry at Highpoint.   This will include both past and current actions of the church and its leadership concerning his ministry, the impact of those actions, and advising Highpoint as it makes decisions about the future of ministry at Highpoint,  Fredricks wrote in an email. Highpoint reported Tuesday that Fredricks found no other instances of abuse in Savage\u2019s ministry. The investigation\u2019s final findings were communicated to the elders and trustees of the church.   Highpoint leadership has come to recognize that it was defensive rather than empathetic in its initial reaction to Ms. Jules Woodson\u2019s communication concerning the abuse she experienced, and humbly commits to develop a deeper understanding of an appropriate, more compassionate response to victims of abuse,  the church said in a separate statement. The megachurch has also asked MinistrySafe, a Texas-based legal team that seeks to help churches set up sexual abuse prevention protocols, to conduct an audit of the church\u2019s current child safety protocols.

But WKGN-AM radio host Cody McClure in Knoxville, Tennessee, figured some irreverence was called for after No. 11 seed Loyola upset No. 3 University of Tennessee on Saturday to reach the Sweet 16.

I would issue an apology to Sister Jean,\u2019\u2019 he said to the paper.  If this were to ever get back to Sister Jean, I would hope that she understood that it was meant to be nothing more than a joke. I\u2019m not some kind of monster.

      "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. film and TV studio The Weinstein Company, whose ex-Chairman Harvey Weinstein has been accused of sexual harassment and assault, said on Monday it filed for bankruptcy and was ending all non-disclosure agreements that may have silenced some women. The Weinstein Company filed for bankruptcy in the Delaware court, listing $500 million to $1 billion in liabilities and $500 million to $1 billion in assets, and said it struck a deal with an affiliate of private equity firm Lantern Capital Partners to acquire its assets.  The bankruptcy comes after the studio spent months looking for a buyer or investor. The company inked a deal with an investor group led by former Obama administration official Maria Contreras-Sweet, but the group terminated its offer earlier this month after seeing that the company had more liabilities than previously disclosed. The Weinstein Company said in a statement it entered into a  stalking horse  agreement with a Lantern Capital affiliate, that would purchase substantially all of the assets of the company. The offer from Lantern will set the floor for higher and better bidders in a court-supervised auction. Lions Gate Entertainment Corp had made an earlier offer for some of the company\u2019s assets, as had Qatar-owned film company Miramax, which was founded by Harvey Weinstein and his brother Bob Weinstein. Both could be among potential bidders in the auction. More than 70 women accused the company\u2019s co-founder, Harvey Weinstein, who was one of Hollywood\u2019s most influential men, of sexual misconduct, including rape. Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone.  Since October, it has been reported that Harvey Weinstein used non-disclosure agreements as a secret weapon to silence his accusers. Effective immediately, those \u2018agreements\u2019 end,  the company said in an emailed statement. Movie producer Killer Content also said bankruptcy would be the best option for the company, and that it may be interested in the studio\u2019s assets in a bankruptcy auction. In February, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman sued The Weinstein Company, Harvey Weinstein and his brother Bob Weinstein, alleging that Harvey Weinstein sexually harassed employees and the company failed to respond. Bob Weinstein co-founded the company and is the co-chairman.  This is a watershed moment for efforts to address the corrosive effects of sexual misconduct in the workplace,  Schneiderman said in a statement after the company\u2019s announcement on Monday. Launched in October 2005, the studio produced and distributed critically acclaimed hits including  The King\u2019s Speech  and  Silver Linings Playbook,  as well as TV series such as long-running fashion reality competition  Project Runway.

A lot of video vixens have spoke about this and nobody gives a fuck,  she said, referring to harassment faced by women who star in music videos.  When I was trying to be a vixen, people were like, \u2018You want to be on the cover of this magazine?\u2019 Then they pull their dicks out. I bet if one of these women stands up and talks about it, people are going to say, \u2018So what? You\u2019re a ho. It don\u2019t matter.\u2019   The Bronx rapper told the publication she was happy to see sexual harassment in Hollywood being exposed, but she has serious doubts about the impact of the movement for many women in the hip-hop world. She even suggested that the men in Hollywood who have expressed support for the Me Too movement probably shouldn\u2019t be trusted.

She said the real truth is that she made good money, and that stripping was (and is) a legitimate job.  People ask, \u2018Why did you strip?\u2019  she said.  I don\u2019t really want to say, \u2018Oh, because I was in a relationship with a guy and I needed money to leave.\u2019 People say, \u2018Why do you always got to say that you used to be a stripper?

      "text": "In the wake of the Me Too reckoning, many have assumed that older and younger women \u2015 second- and third-wave feminists \u2015 have different perspectives on the anti-sexual-violence movement. The older generation allegedly believe younger women need to be less sensitive and essentially buck up, while younger women think older women are out of touch with what constitutes sexual assault and harassment.  A new survey from Vox Media in partnership with Morning Consult, however, disproves this theory by a long shot.   The results of our survey contradict the idea that there\u2019s a war raging over #MeToo between generations of American women,  Vox\u2019s Anna North wrote.  Instead, we found a lot of similarities across the age divide when it came to what women think about #MeToo \u2015 and what too many of them still experience in the workplace.  According to the report, published on Tuesday, a majority of women of all ages support the Me Too reckoning and believe the movement fairly represents their interests. Seventy-one percent of women 34 and under and 68 percent of women 35 and older responded that they support the movement. Only 8 percent of women under 35 opposed Me Too, while a slightly larger percentage (14 percent) of women over 35 also opposed it. The poll was conducted from March 2-8 of this year, and sampled 2,511 women over the age of 18. The survey was conducted online and centered around cis gender people.  Researchers explained why they divided women by this age range:  We chose to compare women ages 18 to 34 with women 35 and over because much media conversation around #MeToo and generational divides focused on millennials. Definitions of \u2018millennial\u2019 vary, but most put the oldest members of the generation in their mid-30s today.  The survey found that younger women were more concerned about the negative outcomes of Me Too than older women. Thirty-one percent of women under 35 said they were  very  concerned about the Me Too movement causing men to deny women professional opportunities, while only 23 percent of women over 35 agreed. The margin was smaller between younger and older women when asked if they were worried about men being denied due process: 22 percent of younger women and 23 percent of older women said they were  very  concerned about this issue.  Vox and Morning Consult also found another surprising fact: Older and younger women experience similar rates of sexual harassment despite decades of discussions about gender equality in the workplace. Twenty-nine percent of younger women and 33 percent of older women responded that they have experienced sexual harassment at work, although older women are less likely to report the harassment.

      "text": "Hundreds of women joined together in Poland on Sunday to voice their frustration with a campaign by Roman Catholic bishops to further restrict abortion access in the country. The abortion rights activists were speaking out against a decision by the Polish bishops\u2019 conference to support a bill that would ban abortion in cases where the fetus had a congenital disorder or deformity.  About 400 people demonstrated outside the Catholic archbishop\u2019s headquarters in Warsaw, according to The Associated Press. Another group protested in front of an archdiocese building in Krakow. The protesters carried wire hangers to symbolize the dangers facing women driven to obtain illegal abortions by Poland\u2019s already stringent laws. The anti-abortion bill began as a citizens\u2019 initiative pushed by conservative groups. On Monday, it won the support of a parliamentary committee on human rights, which means it will be studied by a second committee before potentially being submitted for a vote in Poland\u2019s parliament, according to Agence France Presse.  If the measure passes these remaining hurdles, Polish President Andrzej Duda has pledged to sign the bill into law, AFP reports. But according to the Federation for Women and Family Planning, a Polish reproductive rights group, the measure had been languishing in a  legislative freezer  \u2015 until the Catholic bishops intervened.   This illustrates the enormous power of the Church and the strong resistance of the politicians to put human rights over their own interests in the light of the upcoming elections in 2018 (local) and 2019 (national),  the federation said in a statement. Poland already has some of the most stringent anti-abortion laws in Europe. The staunchly Catholic country made abortion illegal, with a few exceptions, in 1993. The move was strongly supported by Polish Catholic church leaders. Then-Pope John Paul II campaigned in his home country in favor of the bill. Today, women in Poland are allowed to obtain abortions only if the mother\u2019s life is at risk, there\u2019s a fetal abnormality, or the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest. Women can have a hard time finding doctors who will perform abortions even when they fall under those exceptions, according to Time. As a result, some women travel to nearby countries like Germany to have the procedure done or seek abortions from underground providers in Poland. Others order pills for abortions online. According to Poland\u2019s official statistics, about 1,000 legal abortions occur there every year. (The country has a population of roughly 38 million.) Abortion rights activists say the number of illegal abortions could be more than 10 times higher. An estimated 95 percent of legal abortions in Poland are obtained because of fetal abnormalities, The Guardian reports. Polish women have been voicing opposition to their country\u2019s restrictive abortion laws in recent years. In 2016, thousands of women went on strike across the country to protest a draft law that sought to enact a total ban on abortion. About 30,000 people gathered in a central Warsaw square to demonstrate against the legislation. It was ultimately rejected. "

Navratilova said in a BBC Panorama documentary to air Monday that McEnroe earned at least 10 times more than she did for BBC coverage of the Grand Slam tournament.  It\u2019s hard to really compare exactly because some people work a little longer days, maybe a few more programs or whatever,  Navratilova said in a preview clip of  Britain\u2019s Equal Pay Scandal,  posted by BBC Panorama (watch above).  But overall, it was a shock because John McEnroe makes at least 150,000 pounds. I get about 15,000 pounds for Wimbledon. And unless John McEnroe\u2019s doing a whole bunch of stuff outside of Wimbledon, he\u2019s getting at least 10 times as much money than I am for very comparable work.  Navratilova made about 10 appearances compared with 30 for McEnroe during Wimbledon, BBC Panorama estimated, per the Telegraph. BBC Sport told the Guardian that McEnroe\u2019s participation was of  a different scale, scope and time commitment.   Along with Sue Barker, John is regarded as the face of our Wimbledon coverage,  a spokeswoman said.  He is a defining voice within the BBC\u2019s coverage. He is widely considered to be the best expert/commentator in the sport, highly valued by our audiences and his contract means he cannot work for another UK broadcaster without our permission. His pay reflects all of this \u2013 gender isn\u2019t a factor.  McEnroe\u2019s earnings came to light last year when the BBC published a list of its highest-paid personalities, putting his pay between \u00a3150,000 and \u00a3199,999 ($210,560 to $280,740), HuffPost UK reported. The tennis championships last about two weeks. When told that the BBC may use McEnroe\u2019s greater hours as a defense, Navratilova said the disparity still didn\u2019t add up. She said she was told that she and McEnroe were making a comparable wage.  It makes me angry for the other women that I think go through this,  she said.

Strampel, the longtime boss of convicted pedophile Larry Nassar and former dean of Michigan State University\u2019s College of Osteopathic Medicine, said in 2016 that he didn\u2019t believe the athletes who accused Nassar of sexual abuse, The Wall Street Journal reports. Strampel supervised Nassar for almost 15 years during Nassar\u2019s tenure as MSU\u2019s team doctor, during which time Nassar sexually abused hundreds of athletes. He stepped down as dean in 2017 due to medical reasons and amid backlash that he had ignored complaints about Nassar. Strampel is still an MSU employee and is named as a defendant in several civil lawsuits against MSU. The Wall Street Journal recently obtained notes from an October 2016 meeting with four students and three MSU administrators about a separate incident of sexual assault between a female and male student. According to the notes, Strampel brushed off the female student\u2019s accusation and pointed to Nassar as an example of how people often lie about abuse:  This just goes to show that none of you learned the most basic lesson in medicine, medicine 101, that you should have learned in your first week: don\u2019t trust your patients,  Dr. Strampel is quoted saying.  Patients lie to get doctors in trouble. And we\u2019re seeing that right now in the news with this Nassar stuff. I don\u2019t think any of these women were actually assaulted by Larry, but Larry didn\u2019t learn that lesson and didn\u2019t have a chaperone in the room, so now they see an opening and they can take advantage of him.  One of the people at the meeting told the news outlet that everyone in the meeting was shocked by Strampel\u2019s comments.  He can\u2019t possibly be serious,  the person said.  Read more at The Wall Street Journal.  Nassar was fired from MSU over allegations of sexual abuse in September 2016, only a few weeks before this meeting. He was arrested in November of the same year on child pornography charges.  A spokeswoman for MSU told HuffPost that the university will not speak on behalf of Strampel, but pointed out that MSU\u2019s interim President John Engler did begin the process of terminating Strampel\u2019s employment in February.    William Strampel did not act with the level of professionalism we expect from individuals who hold senior leadership positions, particularly in a position that involves student and patient safety,  Engler said at the time.  We are sending an unmistakable message today that we will remove employees who do not treat students, faculty, staff or anyone else in our community in an appropriate manner.  The termination process for Strampel could take up to a year.  MSU\u2019s College of Osteopathic Medicine did not immediately respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment. Strampel could not be reached for comment.  MSU and its administration have been put on blast for how the university failed to protect its students. According to an explosive report from The Detroit News, at least 14 MSU staffers and representatives were told of Nassar\u2019s abuse but did nothing to stop it.  According to court records, Nassar abused at least 265 children and young athletes during his time at MSU and as the USA Gymnastics team doctor. Last year, Nassar was sentenced to 60 years in prison on child pornography charges. He was recently sentenced to two separate sentences of up to 175 years on child sexual abuse.  This article has been updated to include a comment from a Michigan State University spokeswoman.  "

      "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Forty-five U.S. trade associations representing some of the largest companies in the country are urging President Donald Trump not to impose tariffs on China, warning it would be  particularly harmful  to the U.S. economy and consumers. The organizations said in a letter sent to Trump on Sunday that potential tariffs on China would raise prices on consumer goods, kill jobs and drive down financial markets. The letter marks the latest in a growing rift between Trump and the business community on trade policies, as the president has begun to take more aggressive steps he says are needed to protect domestic industry.  We urge the administration not to impose tariffs and to work with the business community to find an effective, but measured, solution to China\u2019s protectionist trade policies and practices that protects American jobs and competitiveness,  the groups wrote.  Tariffs would be particularly harmful,  they said. The groups called on Trump to work with trade allies to push for changes to China\u2019s policies. The business groups said while they had serious concerns about China\u2019s approach to trade, unilateral tariffs by the United States would only separate the country from allies, and encourage them to replace the U.S. business presence in China when Beijing retaliates. Trade associations publicly pushing back include the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Retail Federation and the Information Technology Industry Council. The Trump administration is said to be preparing tariffs against Chinese information technology, telecoms and consumer products in an attempt to force changes in Beijing\u2019s intellectual property and investment practices. The Republican president recently announced plans to impose tariffs on certain steel and aluminum imports, despite opposition from some business sectors. The groups also called on Trump to allow industry experts to comment on the economic impact of any changes in trade policy before the measures take effect.  We urge the administration to take measured, commercially meaningful actions consistent with international obligations that benefit U.S. exporters, importers, and investors, rather than penalize the American consumer and jeopardize recent gains in American competitiveness,  they said.

The Good Place  actress recently created an Instagram account where people can come together and celebrate body positivity and what self-worth means to them.  Jamil\u2019s first post on the @i_weigh account was a mirror selfie with the message:  I weigh: Lovely relationship. Great friends. I laugh every day. I love my job. I make an honest living. I\u2019m financially independent. I speak out for women\u2019s rights. I like my bingo wings. I like myself in spite of EVERYTHING I\u2019ve been taught by the media to hate myself about.  The bio for the account reads:  Hi I\u2019m @jameelajamil this is my \u2018I Weigh\u2019 movement. For us to feel valuable and see how amazing we are, and look beyond the flesh on our bones.  She also posted the image on her personal Instagram page, saying it caused her to receive  a mad wave  of images of  amazing women posting their own back to me in our revolution against shame and self hatred over our looks, perpetuated by the media.  Jamil then encourages others to keep sending her photos to the @i_weigh account because she\u2019s  fucking tired of seeing women just ignore what\u2019s amazing about them and their lives and their achievements, just because they don\u2019t have a bloody thigh gap.   Please follow the account so we can start this revolution properly and make the fashion and media industry see how many of us are DONE with this shit,  the caption also says.  I Weigh  currently features over 200 photos with all sorts of user-submitted photos that powerfully tell the story of how dozens of individuals view their own self-worth. Jamil has long been a proponent for body positivity in the media, with the initial idea for  I Weigh  being launched after she called out the backlash received by the Kardashian-Jenner sisters. In February, Jamil clapped back at a viral meme on Instagram and wrote in her own Instagram story:  Who gives a F-CK what weight you are? What is this toxic bullshit?   Jamil shared another photo of herself on the  I Weigh  account where she\u2019s holding up two middle fingers, accompanied by the caption:  I am just done with women not seeing how amazing they are because they don\u2019t meet society\u2019s beauty standards.  Cheers to that, Jameela. "

Cheap jewelry giant Claire\u2019s filed for Chapter 11 on Monday, hoping to rid itself of substantial debt, the company announced. Claire\u2019s maintained that it was approaching the bankruptcy filing from a position of strength, using Chapter 11 to restructure its budget sheet, not its operations. So jewelry fans and ear-piercing enthusiasts, fear not! Claire\u2019s plans to continue its store operations per usual throughout the Chapter 11 process. And the U.S. bankruptcy filing pertains only to Claire\u2019s stores in America, not the company\u2019s international subsidiaries. Still, Claire\u2019s, which says it\u2019s pierced over 100 million ears worldwide, plans to close some underperforming stores and renegotiate leases, according to The New York Times. The company expects to emerge from bankruptcy in September 2018 with $1.9 billion less in debt.  While mall traffic has been declining over the years with the rise of online shopping, Claire\u2019s says its beloved ear-piercing service is internet-proof since it cannot be replicated on the web. The company says it pierced 3.5 million ears in the U.S. last year. News of Claire\u2019s Chapter 11 filing comes on the heels of reports that fellow mall tenant Toys R Us may close all of its operations in America, which could affect roughly 33,000 U.S. workers. Toys R Us filed for bankruptcy in September. "

      "text": "Two Muslim women who were arrested in New York City last year claim that police officers forced them to remove their hijabs to pose for mugshots despite the women\u2019s tearful objections that doing so would deeply violate their faith.   Lawyers for Jamilla Clark and Arwa Aziz filed a federal class-action lawsuit against the city on Friday, seeking unspecified damages and a change to current city policy that requires head coverings to be removed for the police department\u2019s official photo \u2015 even those coverings, like headscarves, that do not obscure a person\u2019s face.  No New Yorker should be robbed of their right to practice their faith simply because they are arrested,  Albert Fox Cahn, a lawyer representing the women, told HuffPost.  We want city-wide reform because too many New Yorkers have already suffered under our existing policy, forced to undress against their will.  Cahn, who is the legal director for the New York chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations, contends that the New York Police Department\u2019s policy violates people\u2019s right to religious freedom under the First Amendment and federal law. He said the lawsuit seeks to protect any New Yorker who wears religious head coverings that leave the face visible, including hijabs, yarmulkes, turbans and wigs.   Requiring a Muslim woman to remove her hijab in public is akin to demanding that a secular person strip naked in front of strangers,  the lawsuit argues. Currently, the NYPD\u2019s patrol guide provides that arrestees who refuse to remove their religious head coverings for their official photo should be transported to police headquarters in Manhattan. There, the arrestee can have the picture taken in private by an officer of the same gender.  The New York City Law Department said in a statement to The Associated Press that it\u2019s confident the current policy  passes constitutional muster.   It carefully balances the department\u2019s respect for the customs of all religions with the legitimate law enforcement need to take arrest photos,  the law office said.  Persons who do not wish to remove religious head coverings in front of others have the option of being taken to a separate, more private facility to be photographed.  Clark, a Muslim woman from Cedar Grove, New Jersey, was arrested on Jan. 9, 2017, at Manhattan Family Court for violating a protective order. The lawsuit claims Clark\u2019s abusive former husband had fabricated the charges underlying that order. The charges were later dismissed by prosecutors, The New York Times reports. According to the lawsuit, police officers ordered Clark to remove her hijab to pose for a booking photo. She told them that her religious beliefs barred her from removing her hijab in front of men who did not belong to her immediate family. Police then allegedly informed her that she would be prosecuted if she declined, and one officer made  numerous hostile comments about Muslims,  the lawsuit claims. After being taken to NYPD headquarters, Clark agreed to remove her hijab so that a female officer could take her photo in a private room. But Clark contends that the female officer subsequently showed the photo to approximately five male colleagues.  When they forced me to take off my hijab, I felt as if I were naked. I\u2019m not sure if words can capture how exposed and violated I felt,  Clark said in a CAIR press release. Her lawyers claim that the NYPD maintains at least one photograph of Clark without her hijab in its database.   The existence of this photograph haunts Ms. Clark, who is distressed by the prospect of the photograph being viewed again and again by men who are not members of her immediate family,  the lawsuit says. Aziz, a woman from Brooklyn, New York, contends that she had a similarly distressing experience with New York police. She was arrested on Aug. 30, 2017, for violating a protective order filed  on false pretenses  by a sister-in-law, her lawyers allege. Those charges would also later be dismissed by prosecutors. Officers at Brooklyn Central Booking demanded that Aziz remove her hijab for a photo, according to the lawsuit. She refused, explaining that she wore the hijab for religious reasons. She said she offered to pull the headscarf back slightly to reveal her bangs and hairline, but the officers continued to demand that she remove it entirely. Although they also said she could be transported to NYPD headquarters to take the picture, they allegedly claimed that there was no guarantee a female photographer would be present and that the move would force police to  restart  the entire booking process. Aziz finally agreed to pull the hijab down to her neck. The lawsuit alleges she  wept throughout the entire ordeal  and continues to experience  distress and humiliation  when she thinks about how those pictures may still appear in the NYPD\u2019s database. Turning Point for Women and Families, a Queens-based advocacy group for Muslim survivors of domestic violence, is also listed as a plaintiff in the lawsuit. Its executive director, Robina Niaz, said that fear of police officers can discourage her group\u2019s clients from coming forward with allegations of abuse.  I fear this policy [on head coverings] makes it harder for victims of domestic violence that we serve to report their abusers to the police,  Niaz said in the CAIR press release. The lawsuit seeks to prohibit the NYPD from requiring the removal of  any religious head or hair covering  for the purpose of post-arrest photographs. Cahn declined to comment on how he feels the police department should handle booking photos for Muslim women who wear the niqab or burqa, two types of Islamic garments that cover the face. He said this lawsuit focuses exclusively on the rights of detainees whose religious head coverings leave their faces uncovered. The suit points out that other federal and state entities have policies allowing Muslim women to remain covered in official photos. The U.S. State Department allows religious head coverings in official passport photos. New York\u2019s Department of Motor Vehicles permits women to keep their hijabs on while taking driver\u2019s license photos. Police departments in Michigan, Minnesota and elsewhere also permit religious accommodations in booking photographs.  Being forced to publicly remove the hijab, the lawsuit contends,  is a profound defilement of the wearer\u2019s sincerely-held religious beliefs and a violation of her religious practice.  "

      "text": "Michigan entered the NCAA tournament as a hot pick for the Final Four and a Vegas favorite to outplay its No. 3 seed. Houston had other ideas Saturday in a second-round NCAA matchup, seemingly having the game in hand with senior forward Devin Davis securing a rebound and picking up a foul with 3.9 seconds left and the Cougars holding a 63-61 lead. But Davis missed both of his free throws, setting up freshman Jordan Poole and the Wolverines for a moment they will never forget. Poole\u2019s desperation 3-pointer at the buzzer on a pass from senior guard Muhammad-Ali Abdur-Rahkman secured a 64-63 Michigan win and a date next weekend in the Sweet 16. Poole told reporters that he didn\u2019t even know the shot went in until he saw the reaction from the Michigan bench.  We work on that play thousands of times in practice,  Poole said.  We executed it perfectly, especially from the inbounds pass, getting it to our senior guard Muhammad. Ham could have put the shot up easily, but he had the confidence to find me, and I just knocked the shot down.  I think the guys on the team know that I never lose confidence. You\u2019ve just got to always be ready for the opportunity and for the moment.  Poole, a streaky shooter and spot rotation player hitting 37.8 percent of his 3-pointers, entered the game on a cold run, having scored just 16 points in the Wolverines\u2019 previous five games. In contrast, he hit five 3-pointers against Indiana on Dec. 2.  He obviously found his stroke at the right time. He finished the game with eight points on 3-of-5 shooting from the field in 11 minutes off the bench.  We had him in the scout team earlier in the year because he was still growing and was not a guy that was in our top nine,  Michigan coach Jim Beilein said of Poole after the game.  And the shot clock would get down and, you know, the first team\u2019s all excited they\u2019re going to get a stop, and he\u2019d put in a buzzer shot.  Davis, meanwhile, was great at the line throughout the game but missed three of his last four free throws as he finished 9-of-12 from the stripe. It was a stunning finish that demonstrated the immense joy and devastating heartbreak the NCAA tournament is known for. The game was tight throughout as both teams struggled to score and traded the lead 17 times. Houston shot 37 percent from the field while Michigan managed to hit 35.6 percent of its field goals. Junior forward Mortiz Wagner did most of the damage for Michigan with 12 points, seven rebounds and three assists while Abdur-Rahkman also logged 12 points. Charles Matthews and Duncan Robinson were the only other Wolverines in double figures with 11 points each. Rob Gray, Houston\u2019s leading scorer, filled up the box score with 23 points and 10 rebounds, but needed 22 shots to get there. Davis put in a productive 35 minutes, logging 17 points and seven rebounds that will be of little solace after he missed those final free throws. Michigan will move on to face the winner of Sunday\u2019s matchup between North Carolina and Texas A&M. The Wolverines will depend on the stifling defense that led them to the Big Ten tournament title and through the first weekend of the NCAA tournament, but will likely need more from their offense to advance to the next round. But Saturday\u2019s not a night for Michigan to contemplate what\u2019s next. It\u2019s a night for celebration.

      "text": "The world desperately needs more women leaders, but feminists don\u2019t have to love and champion each and every woman who lands in a position of power. This week, Pres. Donald Trump nominated Gina Haspel to run the Central Intelligence Agency. If the Senate confirms her, she will be the first woman to run the CIA in its 70-year history. A female groundbreaker is something to celebrate, right?  But Haspel, a veteran CIA operative who\u2019s been with the agency for more than 30 years, comes with controversy. During the Bush years, after the attacks of Sept. 11, Haspel ran a  black site  prison in Thailand that conducted so-called enhanced interrogation \u2015  torture \u2015 that\u2019s since been exposed, called out and halted. There are also charges that she participated in covering up some of these activities. Many civil rights advocates have already decried her nomination. And because of the secretive nature of the CIA, the extent of her involvement remains murky.  Pres. Trump made sure to brag that Haspel was the first woman chosen to lead the CIA, and some of his staff amplified the point. But considering Haspel\u2019s dark past, it\u2019s not at all clear that her elevation would be anything like a win for women.  Feminism isn\u2019t about wildly agreeing with all women,  Michelle Ryan, a psychology professor at the University of Exeter in England who studies gender and leadership.  It\u2019s about equality.  Typically, the idea that women each be judged on their individual merits is an argument that conservative women make without much fuss. From the right, this view lines up with a belief in the ascendance of individuality. The argument was endlessly rehashed during the presidential election when women on both sides of the aisle proclaimed that they didn\u2019t have to support Hillary Clinton just because she was a woman.   Women are individuals and can think for themselves and ought to,  said Mona Charen, a senior fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center.  It\u2019ll be a great day when people react to a woman based on her individual qualities.   The issue of whether or not to celebrate a pioneering woman regardless of her policies isn\u2019t complicated for Charen. A longtime conservative, who chose not to work for George H.W. Bush because he was too much of a  squish,  she doesn\u2019t necessarily think it matters that there are so few women leaders in politics or business.   Women should do what they want to do,  said Charen, who has a book coming out this summer called Sex Matters: How Modern Feminism Lost Touch With Science, Love and Common Sense.  If they want to be leaders, they should be,  she said. If not, that\u2019s OK, too. Charen, who made a name for herself recently by speaking her mind about Republican hypocrisy at a conservative gathering, noted that Haspel has a strong reputation for competence and is fairly widely respected. (A rarity considering the caliber of those in the Trump orbit these days.) Charen\u2019s been making the case for women to be judged individually throughout her career with little controversy.  However, when progressives, who are typically more focused on women\u2019s rights, don\u2019t automatically celebrate every woman leader, there is more backlash. It really confuses some conservatives when progressive feminist women don\u2019t automatically support every big-name female leader. But that reveals a naked misunderstanding or indifference to women\u2019s rights \u2015 a presumption that all us girls need is to see a woman in power and the feminist project ends there. You need only look back to the uproar around Sarah Palin in 2008 to see the same issues crop up. Republicans tried to gin up enthusiasm for Palin, simply because she was a woman \u2015 a way to draw votes from frustrated women who had supported Hillary Clinton\u2019s failed bid for the Democratic nomination. They didn\u2019t seem to realize that those women cared about actual policies and ideas, too. It\u2019s not enough that a candidate wear a skirt; she must also espouse policies and ideas that empower the people who wear skirts. Palin did not.  The McCain campaign is cynically trying to recreate the excitement that surrounded Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy,  wrote Jessica Valenti in The Guardian at the time.  Believing that all women want is ... another woman.  Kellyanne Conway was the first female presidential campaign manager to win an election. Fox News a while back tried to argue that feminists should therefore love her. Feminists, under this rationale, are also supposed to applaud Sarah Huckabee Sanders for simply being a working mother with a high-profile role. But it\u2019s tough to get psyched about the women in Trump\u2019s orbit. They not only support and enable a man accused multiple times of sexual assault, but who is also openly hostile to policies and positions that would help women. There are a few wrinkles here that probably help add to the confusion on the right.  First, in a collective sense we do want to simply see more women in power. Gender equality \u2015 generally \u2015 leads to more fair outcomes for women. Research has shown that the empowerment of more women can lead to more opportunities for women \u2015 new kinds of jobs, pathways to promotion, etc. More women leaders mean that more girls get female role models to look up to and emulate. You have to see it to be it, the argument goes. More women in power also can lead to a reduction in gender discrimination and an increase in pro-women policies, too. We saw this in the fight to keep Obamacare, a policy with huge benefits for women, in place last year \u2015 it was female Republican senators who kept health care alive. There\u2019s even some research that shows that more women in power leads to a reduction in sexual harassment. It is female senators \u2015 on both sides \u2015 who are pushing for paid leave laws right now. Second, feminists are typically inclined to call out sexism, no matter the target. That means they\u2019ve objected to the misogynistic portrayals of Conway, Sanders and Palin \u2014 even while disagreeing with their policies and positions. It\u2019ll be interesting to see if Haspel faces a sexist, gendered critique in the coming weeks. She\u2019s expected to face tough questioning over her role in the CIA torture program at her confirmation hearing, which is set for April. She\u2019s already been called  the queen of torture.  Because there are so few women at the top of organizations, the ones who do ascend are judged not just on their merits \u2015 but through the lens of their gender.  When a female leader fails, that\u2019s almost always a ding for all women, said Ryan, who is one of the researchers who coined the term  Glass Cliff,  after finding that women were more likely to be thrust into leadership positions at organizations that were already imperiled. It\u2019s possible Haspel\u2019s involvement in the CIA\u2019s program will be judged more harshly because women are often expected to somehow be more moral, empathetic and caring than men:  We don\u2019t expect women to be involved in torturing people,  Ryan said. Would a man be called out in the same way facing the same charges, she asked. (It recalls the way Lynndie England became the face of the horrifying story of torture in Iraq, even as there were so many others involved and making the decisions that enabled her.) Not everyone is that worried about sexism and Haspel. Now that she\u2019s shattered the glass ceiling, Haspel should be judged on her merits, said Juliette Kayyem, former assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security and a lecturer at the Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School of Government.   There\u2019s not a female approach to homeland security,  said Kayyem, who worked under Janet Napolitano during the Obama administration.  Interestingly, Kayyem also pointed out that it\u2019s actually been easier for women to reach the top in national security \u2015 Kirstjen M. Nielsen runs DHS currently \u2015 than break through at an operational level.  Rank and file agents and officers are still more likely to be men at the CIA, Kayyem said:  It\u2019s not uncommon to be in a room where senior leadership is more diverse than the agents and investigators.  We can applaud Haspel for being the first, Kayyem said.  But we need to know why we\u2019re applauding it. She is a woman who ought to now be judged as we would want a man to be judged.  Or, in other words, she should be judged as we would want any human to be. That\u2019s equality. "

The ad, which is for a game called  Would You Rather,  asks users if they would rather  slap Rihanna  or  punch Chris Brown.  The social media platform told BBC News that it published the ad  in error  and removed it last weekend, as soon as it was made aware of its mistake. Snapchat has a review process for ads that states it will not publish ads that feature  shocking, sensational, or disrespectful content.   We are sorry that this happened,  Snapchat said. Rihanna, however, isn\u2019t accepting the apology. The singer posted an Instagram story Thursday that said  Throw the whole app-oligy away  in response to Snapchat.

This isn\u2019t about my personal feelings, cause I don\u2019t have much of them \u2026 but all the women, children and men that have been victims of DV in the past and especially the ones who haven\u2019t made it out yet \u2026 you let us down!  Her statement was shared on Twitter by Gennette Cordova: After Rihanna called the company out, Snapchat apologized again, saying the ad was  disgusting.  The insensitive ad came to the public\u2019s attention on Monday when Twitter user Royce Mann screenshot and posted it to the social media platform. It didn\u2019t take long for other users to express their outrage \u2015 including activists Brittany Packnett and Chelsea Clinton. Following Rihanna\u2019s response, shares for Snap Inc., Snapchat\u2019s parent company, dropped nearly 5 percent, Bloomberg reported. The  Wild Thoughts  singer isn\u2019t the only celebrity whose star power has influenced the company\u2019s value. In February, the company dropped in value after Kylie Jenner tweeted,  sooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore.   Would You Rather  did not immediately respond to a request for comment from HuffPost. This post has been updated to note Snapchat\u2019s latest apology and the drop of the company\u2019s stock price.

      "text": "Critics don\u2019t hesitate to point out that country music is a male-dominated industry. In fact, some data suggests that with the recent popularity of  bro country  \u2014 think Luke Bryan or Blake Shelton \u2014 the problem has gotten worse. Women artists notoriously don\u2019t get as much airtime on country radio stations as their male counterparts. If you look at the current Billboard Country Airplay chart, every artist in the top 20 is a male singer or group of men \u2015 with the sole exception of pop singer Bebe Rexha, who collaborated with Florida Georgia Line on  Meant to Be.  Women of color face even more challenges in country music. Their historical contributions to the genre have been erased, and the contemporary mainstream scene is seriously lacking in diversity. In recent years, many women in country music have lamented their underrepresentation on the radio and at live music events.   You would think that we would be farther along in the thinking about women in country music,  Carrie Underwood told Billboard in 2014.  There is certainly not a shortage of talented ladies out there that want so badly to get their fair shot in this business. But there seems to be only room for only a few.  During a candid discussion with other female artists about sexism in country music in 2016, Margot Price said she\u2019s often the only woman on the bill at country shows and notices that many labels seem hesitant to take on female musicians.  Follow Your Arrow  singer Kacey Musgraves said women are held to different standards than men when it comes to radio play.  If they can\u2019t get your song off the ground, it\u2019s immediately blamed on your personality, or the fact that you\u2019re female, or that you didn\u2019t make a radio station program director feel important,  she noted.  In addition to speaking out, many female country artists over the years have recorded songs that tackle gender equality and women\u2019s issues. In honor of Women\u2019s History Month, we\u2019ve put together a list of country songs that feature feminist messages.    Maddie & Tae\u2019s 2014 debut single quickly became known as  the feminist country song.  The Billboard Country Airplay chart-topper was a response to troubling trends in contemporary country music \u2014 namely the rampant objectification of women in songs and music videos from male artists. Notable lyric:  Like all we\u2019re good for is looking good for you and your friends on the weekend, nothing more.  In January 2018, 23 members of Song Suffragettes \u2015 a Nashville songwriting coalition for women \u2015 contributed vocals on  Time\u2019s Up,  an empowering song recorded in support of the Time\u2019s Up Legal Defense Fund to combat sexual misconduct in the workplace. The group is vocal about women\u2019s issues, even creating the hashtag #LetTheGirlsPlay to bring attention to the shortage of airtime and live performance spots for female country singers. Notable lyric:  They say good things come to those who wait. But we\u2019ve waited long enough. Our time is here. Our time is now. Our time has come. And your time is up.  Released in March 2014, Kira Isabella\u2019s  Quarterback  is one of the first mainstream country songs to tackle the topic of rape culture. The lyrics tell the story of a high school girl in the marching band who survives sexual assault at the hands of the hometown hero football star. Even after degrading photos of her appear on Internet, the town sides with the eponymous quarterback. Notable lyric:  Who you gonna blame, the star of the game or the no name girl in the freshman class?  In 1968, Dolly Parton addressed the sexist double standards women face with the title track off her second solo album.  Just Because I\u2019m A Woman  was an anti-slut-shaming anthem before the phrase took hold in mainstream media. Notable lyric:  Yes I\u2019ve made my mistakes, but listen and understand, my mistakes are no worse than yours just because I\u2019m a woman.  A country-fied cover of an early track from singer-songwriter Patty Griffin, the Wreckers\u2019  One More Girl  (2006) is a frank song about the objectification of women. Michelle Branch and Jessica Harp sing about being reduced to sexual objects, as  one more girl on a stage, just one more ass that got stuffed in some jeans.  Notable lyric:  Did you ever take the time to think about who I might be? Where I\u2019ve been, what I\u2019m thinking, who I love, what I\u2019ve seen? ... I\u2019m one more car out on the road that you might pass on your way home. I\u2019m someone\u2019s sister or someone\u2019s wife or just some bitch who\u2019s probably got no life.   What Part of No  speaks from the perspective of a woman at a bar who is fed up with the man persistently hitting on her. The 1992 song is an anthem of female agency in the face of harassment.  Notable lyric:  Sir if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019d rather be alone, from the moment I walked in tonight; you\u2018ve been coming on. If I told you once, I told you twice, I\u2019m just here to unwind. I\u2019m not interested in romance, or what you have in mind. What part of no don\u2019t you understand?  The meaning of Loretta Lynn\u2019s controversial 1975 song,  The Pill,  is pretty straightforward. It\u2019s a celebration from the perspective of a woman who just gained freedom and control over her reproductive health through access to birth control. Notable lyric:  I\u2019m turning down your brooder house cause now I\u2019ve got the pill. All these years I\u2019ve stayed at home while you had all your fun and every year that\u2019s gone by, another baby\u2019s come. There\u2019s gonna be some changes made right here on nursery hill. You set this chicken your last time cause now I\u2019ve got the pill.  Kacey Musgraves\u2019 2013 song calls out the double standards women face ( you\u2019re damned if you do and you\u2019re damned if you don\u2019t ) and empowers listeners to be true to themselves. The chorus is also explicitly non-heteronormative with its  kiss lots of boys or kiss lots of girls if that\u2019s something you\u2019re into  line.  Notable lyric:  If you save yourself for marriage, you\u2019re a bore. If you don\u2019t save yourself for marriage, you\u2019re a whore ... able person. If you won\u2019t have a drink, then you\u2019re a prude. But they\u2019ll call you a drunk as soon as you down the first one.  This narrative song, which has ben covered by Martina McBride, tells the story of a widow and mom who stands up for herself after being slut-shamed for the way she dresses and raises her teenage daughter. In a PTA meeting, she calls out the parents who shamed her by highlighting their various examples of misconduct and utter hypocrisy. Notable lyric:  Mrs. Johnson, you\u2019re wearing your dresses way too high. It\u2019s reported you\u2019ve been drinkin\u2019 and runnin\u2019 round with men and goin\u2019 wild. And we don\u2019t believe you oughta be a bringin\u2019 up your little girl this way.   Mindy McCready\u2019s 1996 song addresses the double standards for men and women when it comes to bad behavior. The narrator of the song complains about being chastised for staying out late and getting drunk with her girlfriends, while many men do the same thing all the time without shame.  Mary Chapin Carpenter\u2019s  He Thinks He\u2019ll Keep Her  tells the story of a woman who gains the strength to walk away from an unhappy marriage after 15 years of dutiful work as a housewife and mother \u2015 juxtaposed against the perspective of a husband who  thinks he\u2019ll keep  his wife because she does everything right. After leaving her husband (and her 15-year job with  not one raise in pay ), the wife can only find a minimum-wage job in the working world. The 1993 song was reportedly inspired by the tagline of 1970s ads for Geritol.  This song by bluegrass singer-songwriter Hazel Dickens is another one that calls for men to understand the way their mistreatment of women and complicity in oppression creates certain female archetypes. Notable lyric:  You abuse her, accuse her, turn her round and use her. Then forsake her any time it suits you. There\u2019s more to her than powder and paint, than her peroxided bleached-out hair. And if she acts that way it\u2019s \u2019cause you\u2019ve had your day. Don\u2019t put her down, you helped put her there.  Mickey Guyton\u2019s 2015 debut single,  Better Than You Left Me,  is about her growth and renewed strength as a woman after a breakup. It also propelled Guyton, one of the relatively small number of black women country artists, to the Billboard Country Airplay Top 40.  After being shunned by the country music industry for their lead singer\u2019s criticism of President George W. Bush and the Iraq War, The Dixie Chicks fought back with  Not Ready to Make Nice.  The 2006 anthem of resistance was in many ways ahead of its time, forging the path for artists and celebrities to use their platforms to speak out on issues that matter to them.  Notable lyric:  And how in the world can the words that I said send somebody so over the edge that they\u2019d write me a letter saying that I better \u2018Shut up and sing\u2019 or my life will be over! ... I\u2019m not ready to make nice. I\u2019m not ready to back down. I\u2019m still mad as hell and I don\u2019t have time to go round and round and round.  Kalie Shorr\u2019s  Fight Like a Girl  was a response to #SaladGate \u2015 a 2015 incident when a country radio consultant said women artists shouldn\u2019t get a lot of airplay because they\u2019re the  tomatoes of our salad  while men are  the lettuce.  Shorr\u2019s song is about female empowerment and grit in the face of adversity.  Notable lyric:  I\u2019m perfume sweet and whiskey strong. I damn sure ain\u2019t no underdog. I might fall down but I get back up. I shine brightest when the going\u2019s tough. You say I can\u2019t \u2015 well, darling, watch me. You can\u2019t stop me \u2019cause I fight like a girl.  Martina McBride\u2019s  A Broken Wing  (1997) tells the story of a woman escaping an emotionally abusive relationship and finding her strength to  fly ... with a broken wing.  Notable lyric:  With a broken wing. She carries her dreams. Man you oughta see her fly.  The theme song to her show  Reba,  McEntire\u2019s  I\u2019m a Survivor  celebrates women\u2019s might. The 2001 song focuses on a premature baby girl and a hardworking single mom and their roles as  fighters  and  survivors.  Notable lyric:  A single mom who works two jobs. Who loves her kids and never stops. With gentle hands and a heart of a fighter. I\u2019m a survivor.

      "text": "(Reuters) - IHeartMedia Inc filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Thursday as the largest U.S. radio station owner reached an in-principle agreement with creditors to restructure its overwhelming debt load. The company, which filed for bankruptcy along with some of its units, said it \u200dreached the agreement with holders of more than $10 billion of its outstanding debt for a balance sheet restructuring, which would reduce its debt by more than $10 billion. IHeartMedia, which has struggled with $20 billion of debt and falling revenue at its 858 radio stations, said cash on hand and cash generated from ongoing operations will be sufficient to fund the business during the bankruptcy process.  The agreement ... is a significant accomplishment, as it allows us to definitively address the more than $20 billion in debt that has burdened our capital structure,  Chief Executive Bob Pittman said. The filing comes after John Malone\u2019s Liberty Media Corp proposed on Feb. 26 a deal to buy a 40 percent stake in a restructured iHeartMedia for $1.16 billion, uniting the company with Liberty\u2019s Sirius XM Holdings Inc satellite radio service. Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings Inc, a subsidiary of iHeartMedia and one of the world\u2019s largest billboard companies, and its units did not commence Chapter 11 proceedings. IHeartMedia skipped a $106 million interest payment on Feb. 1, triggering a 30-day grace period during which the company has tried to hammer out a deal with it bondholders. The company disclosed on Monday it was still exchanging proposals with its creditors, but had yet to reach an agreement. Its most recent proposal would have given holders of secured loans, who are owed nearly $13 billion, about $5.6 billion in new debt and 94 percent of the equity in a reorganized iHeartMedia. These creditors also would have received iHeartMedia\u2019s 89.5 percent stake in Clear Channel Outdoor Holdings. Bain Capital LLC and Thomas H. Lee Partners LP control 68 percent of the voting stock of iHeartMedia, according to the company\u2019s most recent annual report. The private equity firms led a $17.9 billion leveraged buyout of what was then Clear Channel Communications Inc in 2008, just as the buyout boom was fading and as the signs of the financial crisis began to emerge. Shares of iHeartMedia lost three-quarters of their value in the second half of 2015 and have never recovered since then. On Monday, the pink sheet stock closed at 48 cents. IHeartMedia traces its roots to the 1972 purchase of KEEZ-FM in San Antonio, Texas, where it is currently headquartered. It also produces syndicated radio programs that feature  American Idol  host Ryan Seacrest and political personalities Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. The company had 14,300 employees at the end of 2016, according to its most recent annual report. "

      "text": "Toys R Us, an iconic U.S. retailer of children\u2019s toys, has announced plans to file liquidation papers and likely close most if not all of its remaining stores, potentially impacting up to 33,000 U.S. workers. In a conference call with staff on Wednesday, reported on by The Wall Street Journal, CEO David Brandon said the company would file the papers ahead of a bankruptcy court hearing Thursday.  I have always believed that this brand and this business should exist in the U.S.,  Brandon told employees. The CEO blamed the liquidation on a number of factors, including vendors who didn\u2019t support the company during the crucial holiday season and customers who choose to shop elsewhere. They  will all live to regret what\u2019s happening here,  Brandon said. A representative for Toys R Us on Wednesday confirmed the Journal\u2019s report and noted that there would not be an immediate shut down.  Administrators for the retailer also said Wednesday that the company plans to close all 75 remaining stores in the United Kingdom, which will affect roughly 3,000 workers. The big box retailer, which has some 1,600 Toys R Us and Babies R Us stores around the world, filed for bankruptcy in September over $5 billion in long-term debt. The company said the debt had prevented it from investing to compete in what it called  an increasingly challenging and rapidly changing retail marketplace worldwide.  The company missed payments to several suppliers in recent days, Bloomberg reported, prompting some to speculate that liquidation was likely on the horizon. The toy chain is already in the process of closing down about 180 of its more than 800 U.S. stores. A CNBC report Wednesday cited people familiar with the situation who said the retailer was working on a proposal to keep about 200 stores open even after the liquidation. The plan may include selling the company\u2019s Canadian operations, along with roughly 200 of the company\u2019s most profitable U.S. stores, to a new buyer, according to CNBC. "

      "text": "In a complaint filed Wednesday, the Securities and Exchange Commission leveled charges of  massive fraud  against Elizabeth Holmes, founder and CEO of the Silicon Valley startup Theranos \u2015 charges Holmes has agreed to settle. The SEC also named former Theranos President Ramesh  Sunny  Balwani in its complaint, accusing Holmes and Balwani of raising over $700 million from investors  through an elaborate, years-long fraud in which they exaggerated or made false statements about the company\u2019s technology, business, and financial performance.  Per the SEC, the settlements are subject to court approval, and neither Theranos nor Holmes has admitted to or denied the allegations against them. The privately held startup had promised to revolutionize the blood testing industry, claiming its proprietary technology could run more than 240 tests on a single drop of blood. Fueled by that claim, and by an early (and ultimately doomed) partnership with Walgreens, Theranos hit a valuation of around $9 billion in 2014. But by 2016, as news began to spread that Theranos\u2019 technology might not be up to snuff, the company\u2019s value tanked, wiping out Holmes\u2019 $4.5 billion net worth with it. Wednesday\u2019s SEC complaint asserts that the company\u2019s claims about its technological abilities were misrepresentations at best and outright lies at worst. For instance, Theranos claimed the U.S. Department of Defense deployed its portable blood analyzers to Afghanistan for use aboard medevac helicopters, generating $100 million in revenue in 2014. Not only did the DOD never do such a thing, but Theranos\u2019 2014 revenues were actually closer to $100,000.  The Theranos story is an important lesson for Silicon Valley,  Jina Choi, director of the SEC\u2019s San Francisco Regional Office, said in a release.  Innovators who seek to revolutionize and disrupt an industry must tell investors the truth about what their technology can do today, not just what they hope it might do someday.  As part of the settlement, Holmes has agreed to pay a $500,000 penalty and relinquish 18.9 million shares of Theranos stock and her voting control in the company. She\u2019s also been barred from serving as a director of a public company for 10 years. "

      "text": "Facebook isn\u2019t typically shy about proclaiming its support for women. After all, chief operating officer and  Lean In  author Sheryl Sandberg built her brand on feminism. Last year, the tech giant even took the rare step of publicizing its own rules and practices on sexual harassment. But on one critical policy, Facebook is awfully wishy-washy: forced arbitration. Facebook is one of many companies that requires employees to take legal disputes, like discrimination or wage claims, to private courtrooms. The process has come under fire for its role in silencing victims of sexual harassment, especially in the wake of the Me Too movement. In a series of conversations with HuffPost over the past few weeks, Facebook representatives took part in a strange dance: They defended the company\u2019s use of forced arbitration, but also said Facebook was considering its position on a bipartisan bill that would make forced arbitration illegal in sexual harassment cases.  We\u2019re studying it and haven\u2019t taken a position,  a Facebook spokesman told HuffPost.  Adult film actress Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels, put arbitration back in the headlines this month, after an arbitrator ordered her to stay silent about her alleged affair with President Donald Trump. The arbitration process Facebook uses is very  official and appropriate,  a spokeswoman told HuffPost. She pointed out that although the social networking giant uses arbitration, it doesn\u2019t require that participants keep silent, as other employers often do. (HuffPost could find no evidence of any employee speaking publicly about litigation against the company.) Arbitration is good for employees because matters are kept private, she said. She also argued that arbitration is a neutral practice, pointing out that the company and its accuser both have a say in which judge they use. She emphasized that Facebook takes harassment seriously and has an in-depth training process for employees.  Our philosophy is to prevent these claims in the first place,  she said. In a statement issued on Wednesday, hours after HuffPost published this story, the company\u2019s head of employment law, Heidi Swartz, wrote,  Facebook does not use \u2018secret courts\u2019 to handle sexual harassment cases as alleged by HuffPost. That claim is false and misleading. We have never had an employee file a sexual harassment arbitration.   If the past year or so has taught us anything, it\u2019s that even companies with the best intentions and the most sensitive executive leaders don\u2019t catch every bad actor. Opponents of forced arbitration say that getting rid of such secretive practices is key to combating sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace.  The easiest mistake any employer can make is to assume that \u2018this could never happen here,\u2019  Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote in a December blog post announcing that the company would no longer send harassment to arbitration.  While it\u2019s natural to hope and believe that\u2019s the case, one of the fundamental lessons of recent months is that people\u2019s voices need to be heard if their problems are to be addressed.  (Microsoft is currently in the middle of a gender discrimination suit filed by a former female technical employee.) Microsoft is the one major tech company that\u2019s thrown its support behind the the Ending Forced Arbitration of Sexual Harassment Act. The bill, introduced by Rep. Cheri Bustos (D-Ill.) in December, would make it illegal to force employees to take sexual harassment suits to private arbitration. Instead, employees would have a choice in the matter, giving them more leverage in going up against a deep-pocketed corporation.  I\u2019m glad Facebook says they feel they\u2019re taking harassment seriously, but I had hope that they\u2019d actually Lean In and lead by example on this,  Bustos told HuffPost, using Sandberg\u2019s book title to make her point.  All businesses need to take a look at this issue. Time\u2019s up on letting companies use legal tools to sweep harassment under the rug,  she said. It\u2019s unclear where the other tech giants stand on the issue: Google and Apple did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s requests to talk about the bill. Amazon would only say that it doesn\u2019t use arbitration. But the bill actually has some bipartisan support, cosponsored in the House by Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) and in the Senate by Sens. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Kamala Harris (D-Calif.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). Former Fox News host Gretchen Carlson is also pushing for the legislation, helping announce it on Capitol Hill at the end of the year. Carlson drew attention to forced arbitration in 2016 by maneuvering around her employment contract and suing her harasser directly in court.  The bill gives women (and men) a choice: do they want a harassment claim to go to secret arbitration, or utilize their 7th amendment right and go to a public court?  Carlson said in a message to HuffPost.  Any company outwardly lobbying against this bill makes one wonder what they may have to hide.  Because of the secrecy of the arbitration process, it\u2019s difficult to say how many women it silences. In one egregious example, The Washington Post was able to learn about hundreds of women accusing Sterling Jewelers, the multibillion dollar company behind Kay Jewelers and Jared, of widespread discrimination.  Bustos said that the Sterling story was the first time she\u2019d even heard of forced arbitration, and it inspired her to craft this legislation. For every journalistic scoop, however, many more cases are forever buried. Facebook has spent thousands of dollars lobbying on the arbitration bill, according to public records. But there\u2019s no indication in the record of where the company stands on the bill. Facebook, for its part, said that the money was spent to research the legislation, not to argue a particular stance. As of publication, Facebook\u2019s lobbying firm had not amended its lobbying disclosure.  Facebook has hundreds of lawyers and lobbyists advising them on law and policy. We are talking about a two-page bill that was introduced last year on an issue that is in the news every day,  said Andrew Rogers, the director of legislative affairs at the American Association of Justice, a nonprofit advocacy group for plaintiffs lawyers that opposes arbitration.  Any company that says it is still \u2018mulling it over\u2019 isn\u2019t acting in good faith, and is just hoping the movement quietly fades away,  Rogers said. Microsoft endorsed the bill last year, he pointed out. Another sign that the bill has momentum: In February, all 50 state attorneys general took the rare step of joining together to call companies to end the practice and for Congress to pass the bill.  Ending mandatory arbitration of sexual harassment claims would help to put a stop to the culture of silence that protects perpetrators at the cost of their victims,  the letter says. About 60.1 million workers in the U.S. are beholden to mandatory arbitration clauses, according to a study released last year by the progressive Economic Policy Institute. Many of them have no idea; you can agree to give up your right to file a lawsuit simply by accepting an employee handbook. Employees win in arbitration only 21 percent of the time, according to an earlier paper from EPI \u2015 a much lower rate than you\u2019d find in state or federal court. And if they win, monetary damages are far lower as well \u2015 less than half of what a victim would be awarded in court. If a victim loses, many companies will require her to pay arbitration fees. Many employee complaints never even make it to arbitration, because the deck is so stacked against them. For one thing, lawyers are reluctant to take on clients in arbitration where payouts are much lower, writes NYU law professor Cynthia Estlund in a working paper published in February called  The black hole of mandatory arbitration.  Almost half of companies that use arbitration clauses also include language in them that prevents employees from joining together in class action suits, Estlund notes. That means that if a group of female employees were all harassed by the same man, they would each have to sue the company individually. That\u2019s a huge disadvantage to employees, who are already far less empowered than the company they\u2019re fighting. The issue is currently before the Supreme Court. Former Facebook engineer Chia Hong sued Facebook for sexual harassment and discrimination in 2015. Hong alleged she was frequently ignored and belittled in meetings where she was sometimes the only woman, was admonished for taking a personal day each month to volunteer at her kid\u2019s school, and was ordered to serve drinks to male colleagues.  Her case was dismissed that year, but it\u2019s not clear why. Facebook would only say that it didn\u2019t go to arbitration. Meanwhile, with or without Facebook\u2019s support, it remains unlikely that the bill will be brought to the floor in the Republican-majority House anytime soon. Bustos has been tweeting at House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) every day this month, asking him to bring the bill to a vote.  This is in his hands. He could make a decision or he could take the side of sexual harassers,  she said. Last week, on International Women\u2019s Day, her tweet to Ryan was particularly poignant.  Instead of sending Congress home before noon on #InternationalWomensDay, we should have been voting on our bipartisan bill to drive #SexualHarassment out of the workplace,  Bustos wrote. Also on International Women\u2019s Day, Sandberg wrote a passionate Facebook tribute to women.  I\u2019m more dedicated than ever to creating a more equal world that will also be a better world,  she wrote at the end of a long status about women\u2019s rights. Clarification: Language in this story has been amended to clarify that it was Facebook\u2019s lobbying arm, and not Facebook itself, that had not amended its lobbying disclosure by publication time.

      "text": "In early January, a Tennessee pastor who stood accused of sexual assault received a standing ovation from members of his evangelical Christian congregation after confessing to a  sexual incident  with a woman 20 years before. Now, the woman who went public with her allegations against her former youth pastor is again speaking out about her experience, this time urging American churches to more fully reckon with their responsibility to sexual assault victims.  We as a church, of all places, should be getting this right,  Jules Woodson said in a New York Times op-ed video published on Friday.  It\u2019s unfathomable to me that the secular world, Hollywood, are taking a stand. The church should have been the first group to stand up and say, \u2018We will not allow this.\u2019  Woodson came forward in January with allegations against her former youth pastor, Andy Savage. She claims that when she was 17 in 1998, Savage drove her to a private location after a church event in Texas and forced her to perform sexual acts. She said church leaders at Woodlands Parkway Baptist Church (which later changed its name to StoneBridge Church) urged her to keep quiet and promised the church would take care of the matter internally. Savage later moved to Memphis, where he eventually became a pastor at Highpoint Church.  After Woodson came forward with her story in January, Highpoint Church initially said that it had  total confidence in the redemptive process  Savage went through after he allegedly assaulted Woodson. Savage was placed on leave after the church received backlash in the national media \u2015 one critic called the congregation\u2019s response, which was streamed online, the standing ovation  heard round the world.  Savage said during his apology that he told Highpoint\u2019s lead pastor about the incident before coming on board as staff. The New York Times filmed Woodson\u2019s reactions to a video recording of Savage delivering his apology at Highpoint Church. Woodson criticized the apology, pointing out that Savage called what happened to her a  sexual incident  and repeatedly referred to the fact that it happened decades ago.  I was and remain very remorseful for the incident and deeply regret the pain I caused her and her family as well as the pain I caused the church and God\u2019s kingdom,  Savage said during his apology.  My repentance over this sin 20 years ago was done believing that God\u2019s forgiveness is greater than any sin. And I still believe that.  Woodson was in tears as she spoke in the op-ed video about the alleged crime and her church\u2019s response.  I looked up to him. I trusted him,  Woodson said about Savage in the video.  What happened was a crime. This is not something that the church should handle internally.    I want our churches to change how they handle sexual assault,  she added.  Sexual assault in the church. It\u2019s a crime, not just a sexual sin.  Woodson\u2019s words echo the reflections of other survivors of sexual abuse in Christian communities. Inspired by the Me Too movement, survivors have used the hashtag #ChurchToo to share stories of abuse that happens in church settings. Hannah Paasch, one of the founders of #ChurchToo, claims that a culture of purity in evangelical church settings has created the ideal of a  gentle and quiet  woman who accept the authority and leadership of men.   The stories that have poured in through the hashtag prove to me that the evangelical church, in its current iteration, actively supports the confessing abuser over the victim and, in the name of \u2018having no appearance of evil,\u2019 has managed to silence thousands of sexual and physical abuse allegations throughout the years,  Paasch wrote in an op-ed for HuffPost.  Historian Neil J. Young, who studies the religious right, wrote that evangelical churches often tend to place the abuser at the center of the story, making the priority  forgiveness for his sins rather than justice for her injury.    It is his words of confession and embarrassment, but also often rationalization, that a church body gathers together to hear on a Sunday morning, not her cries of rage and pain that they must confront,  Young wrote in an op-ed for HuffPost.  If #MeToo has been about breaking the silence, the evangelical response has been to allow the abuser\u2019s voice to fill the void.  Highpoint has initiated two investigations into how the church handled the allegations against Savage, and whether its current policies are sufficient to safeguard the safety of children. On March 4, the church released a statement saying that the investigation was  wrapping up  and that its initial findings  give us assurance that we can begin the long process of moving forward as a church.  Highpoint did not respond to HuffPost\u2019s request for comment.  Just as the culture around us is waking up to the suffering expressed by the courageous voices of the #metoo movement, we are taking very seriously our commitment to fully understand how our church should minister to the needs of the people we impact,  the church wrote on its website.

He\u2019s already being done in. There\u2019s no advantage in piling on again,  Carter told Tim Teeman in an interview published Monday. Although Carter refused to divulge the name of her abuser, she said he\u2019s being punished for his crimes \u2015 although  it isn\u2019t enough.  According to Carter, her abuser violated  a lot of people.  She told The Daily Beast that she had initially researched pursuing legal action, but later came to the conclusion that it wouldn\u2019t help.   I can\u2019t add anything to it. I wish I could,  Carter said of the justice her abuser has faced.  But there\u2019s nothing legally I could add to it, because I looked into it. I\u2019m just another face in the crowd. I wish I could, and if I could I would.  Carter said she didn\u2019t want to shift the focus of the conversation to her.  I don\u2019t want it to be about me, it\u2019s not about me. It\u2019s about him being a scumbag,  she said. Carter said it\u2019s been very powerful watching the Me Too movement unfold \u2015 albeit somewhat triggering.  I asked my husband if he was surprised by all the #MeToo stories. \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m surprised,\u2019 he said,  Carter told The Daily Beast.  Ask any woman, they\u2019re not surprised. It\u2019s been going on for years. It\u2019s not news to us [women], but it is news to you [men]. We\u2019ve been trying to tell you. We\u2019ve been trying to tell you for a long time and you haven\u2019t listened.  Carter said she experienced sexual harassment on the  Wonder Woman  set, including a cameraman who secretly drilled a hole in her dressing room to watch her change.   They caught him, fired him, and drummed him out of the business,  she said. She said that the punishment for her harasser was quite an anomaly at the time, adding later that she rarely reported the workplace harassment and abuse she faced.   Who are you going to tell? Who you are going to tell except your girlfriends and your circle of friends? You\u2019d say or hear, \u2018Stay away from that guy.\u2019 \u2018Watch out for this casting director.\u2019 And so you would hear it from other people, other people would hear it from other people. \u2018Watch out for so and so,\u2019  Carter said.  That\u2019s how you protected yourself: through the grapevine. We were women\u2019s lib, burn the bra. We weren\u2019t going to take any shit from people. So we felt strong in that, but there were still not a lot of parts for us.  Carter added that she believes  every woman  in the Bill Cosby case and she believes the 21 women who have come forward with accusations of sexual harassment and assault against President Donald Trump.   Why would they lie?  she asked.  I believe the women.  Head over to The Daily Beast to read Carter\u2019s full interview.  "

Some athletes have opted out of invitations to President Donald Trump\u2019s White House because of his divisive politics. Many Philadelphia Eagles players have already said they would not be attending should the invitation be offered to the Super Bowl champs. On Monday, the World Series champion Houston Astros got their turn to meet the president. While we don\u2019t specifically know American League MVP Jos\u00e9 Altuve\u2019s politics, the second baseman made it clear he was not there for Trump. For the majority of the event, Altuve stood stone-faced, hands at his side, most notably when Trump went down the line shaking hands. Oof, that\u2019s cold. Altuve did shake the president\u2019s hand when being singled out, and he appeared gracious when the president complimented him, but there was a tinge of awkward hesitation in the air. Trump tweeted about the meeting Monday evening. Altuve is smiling with everyone in the official group photo, but the rest of the time Altuve looks more business than pleasure.   Grab some snacks at the concession stand and get comfy, though, because we probably have at least a few more riveting photo ops of pro athletes visiting the Trump White House. "

A new Harris Poll found that nearly one out of four (23 percent) men in countries across the world thought it was sometimes or always acceptable for an employer to expect sex from an employee. The poll, commissioned by the nonprofit humanitarian organization CARE and conducted by Harris Poll, was released Thursday for International Women\u2019s Day. It surveyed 9,400 adults in Australia, Ecuador, Egypt, India, South Africa, the U.S., the U.K. and Vietnam.  Being expected to have sex with your employer \u2014 that\u2019s not a job description, it\u2019s sexual abuse,  CARE CEO Michelle Nunn said in a statement.  It speaks to the global epidemic of harassment and abuse in our workplaces.  Sexual harassment at work isn\u2019t even illegal in nearly one-third of the world.  If we now know how difficult it is on the producers\u2019 chair in Los Angeles, imagine how difficult it is someplace like Bangladesh on the factory floor,  Nunn told Fortune magazine. According to the poll, 32 percent of women and 21 percent of men said they had suffered sexual harassment or assault related to work. In India, one-third (33 percent) of respondents felt it was sometimes or always acceptable to cat-call or whistle at a colleague. And in the U.K., 35 percent of people aged 25 to 35 years old believed it was sometimes or always acceptable to pinch a co-worker\u2019s rear as a joke. Close to 65 percent of women surveyed believed the #MeToo movement will have a positive impact in their countries. In response to the poll, CARE launched a petition drive calling on the International Labor Organization to create new global regulations concerning  freedom from violence in the workplace.   CARE also debuted a new hashtag for discussions about sexual harassment: #ThisIsNotWorking. "

      "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Martin Shkreli, the former drug company executive who made headlines by jacking up the price of a lifesaving drug before he was found guilty of defrauding investors, was sentenced to 7 years and a $75,000 fine on Friday. The sentence from U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto in federal court in Brooklyn, New York, was shorter than the 15 years asked for by prosecutors but much longer than the 12 to 18 monthsShkreli\u2019s lawyers had sought. Shkreli\u2019s lawyer Benjamin Brafman told the judge before the sentencing that Shkreli, 34, suffered from depression and an anxiety disorder and was a  somewhat broken  person, whom the government wanted to  throw away.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Jacquelyn Kasulis had said a 15 year sentence was justified in part because Shkreli\u2019s crimes were not an  isolated lapse in judgment,  but a pattern of conduct including separate frauds for his two hedge funds and for his drug company Retrophin Inc. The Brooklyn-born entrepreneur became known as the  Pharma Bro  in September 2015 after founding Turing Pharmaceuticals, buying the anti-parasitic drug Daraprim and raising its price by 5,000 percent to $750 per pill. Shkreli was indicted for the unrelated securities fraud charges in December 2015. At the hearing, Shkreli had choked up as he said he had learned from his mistakes.  There is no conspiracy to take down Martin Shkreli. I took down Martin Shkreli with my disgraceful and shameful actions,  he said. A jury in August found Shkreli guilty of defrauding investors in two hedge funds he ran, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare, by sending them fake account statements and concealing huge losses. He was also convicted of scheming to prop up the stock price of Retrophin, the drug company he founded in 2011. The $75,000 fine comes on top of $7.36 million in forfeiture Shkreli had already been ordered to pay following his conviction. Brafman, noting that he was old enough to be Shkreli\u2019s father, said his client had not always been easy to work with.  There are times when I want to hug him and hold him and comfort him and there are times when I want to punch him in the face,  Brafman said. Kasulis said Brafman was trying to portray Shkreli as  a child.   Mr. Shkreli is about to turn 35 years old,  she said   He is a man who needs to take responsibility for his actions.  Shkreli has been in jail since September, when Matsumoto revoked his bail after he offered his social media followers $5,000 if they could bring him a hair from former U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.

      "text": "For the past four years, the Voices of Faith conference has brought prominent Catholic women from around the world to the Vatican to highlight women\u2019s voices and their contributions. But this year, the Vatican\u2019s approach to the International Women\u2019s Day event has caused a great deal of controversy \u2015 even prompting one prominent Catholic leader to call her church an  an empire of misogyny.  Unlike in past years, this year\u2019s conference had to be held outside the Vatican\u2019s walls. Conference organizers claim a Vatican organization rejected some women on their list of proposed speakers \u2015 including a lesbian Catholic activist and other women who have been vocal about challenging the church\u2019s stance on homosexuality.  Instead of letting go of these speakers, organizers moved the International Women\u2019s Day event outside of the Vatican to the auditorium of the Jesuit headquarters. At a time when women around the world are speaking up against abuse and demanding greater gender equality, the Vatican\u2019s actions to silence these women speakers have prompted some Catholics to reflect on whether the church really values women\u2019s voices. Ssenfuka Joanita Warry, a lesbian Catholic activist from Uganda, was reportedly one of the women whose presence at the conference did not meet the approval of the Vatican.  During the conference, Warry spoke about what life was like for her as a lesbian activist in a country where homosexuality is illegal. She condemned the silence of religious leaders in the face of this discrimination against queer Ugandans.  Warry said she believes it\u2019s her responsibility to open up dialogue about the church\u2019s teachings about women and queer Catholics.  I believe it is my responsibility, my duty, my role to change the mentality that surrounds me because I believe I\u2019m on a mission from God,  she said.  There is much more I\u2019d want to do in the church, but I\u2019m often limited by my sexual orientation and gender, which was created by God.   I believe things can be different. Women have a lot of roles they can do in the church. Let no one stand in the way of the holy spirit,  she added. Watch a livestream of the Voices of Faith conference below. The Voices of Faith conference is typically held in a small palazzo in the Vatican gardens, according to the Associated Press. In the past, the conference has addressed issues like women\u2019s activism in immigration and education. This year\u2019s conference is organized around the theme  Why Women Matter.  Organizers aimed to spark conversation about how women can become more involved in the decision-making structures of a church dominated by male clergy. Sessions address topics like where Catholic women can look for female role models and whether the church is relevant to young women. In one panel discussion, organizers put forward the question:  Will the Catholic Church survive the 21st century?   If current leaders of the Roman Curia do not include capable qualified women in roles that are theoretically open to them, we face a future where the Catholic Church will be a relic of the past,  the organizers state in a program booklet for the conference.  Our world is changing and the inclusion of women in significant positions is finally being realised. We won\u2019t allow gender inequality to undermine the longevity of the Church.  Cardinal Kevin Farrell, head of the Vatican Dicastery for Laity, Family and Life, reportedly made the decision to reject certain women from Voices of Faith\u2019s proposed speakers list. Along with Warry, Farrell also apparently rejected Tina Beattie, a Catholic feminist and academic, and Mary McAleese, a former president of Ireland and an expert in canon law. Asked about Farrell\u2019s decision, Vatican spokesman Greg Burke told the AP in February that it\u2019s  not a Vatican-sponsored event, and given the nature of the topics being discussed, there should not be confusion about that.  McAleese, the mother of a gay son, has been vocal about welcoming LGBTQ Catholics in the church. She said a church that is  homophobic and anti-abortion  is not the church of the future. During the conference, McAleese challenged Pope Francis to develop a strategy for the inclusion of women in the Catholic Church.  How long can the hierarchy sustain the credibility of a God who wants ... a church where women are invisible and voiceless in church leadership, in legal and doctrinal discernment and decision-making, but actually are expected to do all the hard work that keeps the church going from generation to generation?  McAleese asked while delivering the keynote speech at the conference on Thursday.   Today, the Catholic Church lags noticeably behind the world\u2019s advanced nations in the elimination of discrimination against women, a disgrace to an organization that claims to be created by God for love in the universe.  Pope Francis declined to attend the conference, the BBC reports.  In the past, Pope Francis has spoken of the need to  broaden the opportunities for a stronger presence of women in the church.  He\u2019s appointed women to key positions within the Vatican. Although he\u2019s said there\u2019s no possibility women could become priests in the Catholic Church, he has expressed an interest in clarifying whether there\u2019s historical precedent for women to serve as ordained deacons, who can perform some duties of a priest. Still, many at the Voices of Faith conference said there\u2019s much more the Vatican can do to make use of the gifts and talents of women in the church. McAleese pointed out that Catholic women are often the backbone of their local churches. They are tasked with instilling Catholic values in their children, for example. Despite all the work Catholic women do, McAleese said, the church has not done enough to listen to the voices and opinions of the women in its folds.   Here we are. We are left to talk among ourselves,  McAleese said during her keynote speech.  No church leader bothers to turn up, not just because we do not matter but because their priestly formation prepares them to resist treating us as full equals.    The time for change is now.   "

President Donald Trump\u2019s daughter-turned-White House adviser got an earful on Thursday after turning to Twitter to mark International Women\u2019s Day \u2015 leading to immediate ridicule by people who criticized her and her father for their track record on women\u2019s rights.  Today we come together in recognition of women at home & around the globe,  she tweeted.  We celebrate women\u2019s achievements, past & present, & pledge to empower women to reach their full economic potential for generations to come. When women thrive, we ALL succeed.  Ivanka Trump has said she would make  women\u2019s empowerment  a key issue in her father\u2019s White House.  But people on Twitter, responding to her post, listed reasons why Trump\u2019s latest   pledge to empower women  could use some work.  Critics pointed to her business practices. Her clothing brand\u2019s merchandise is produced in foreign factories, where laborers \u2015 both men and women \u2015 receive low wages and have limited ability to advocate for themselves. Other people on Twitter slammed the powerful White House roles handed to Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, which some see as nepotism. Twitter users also criticized Trump for failing to forcefully speak out against her father\u2019s misbehavior toward women. The president, who once said his star power entitles him to grab women by the genitals, has been accused of sexual misconduct by 21 women. In recent days it was reported that Donald Trump\u2019s personal lawyer attempted to silence adult film star Stormy Daniels, who says she had an affair with Trump while he was married to Melania Trump. Some Twitter users reminded Ivanka Trump of her demonstrated ability to flip-flop between her roles as White House adviser and first daughter, depending on the circumstances. Recently, for example, she was asked during an interview to comment on allegations of sexual misconduct against the president. She called it  a pretty inappropriate question to ask a daughter.  The backlash against Ivanka Trump\u2019s Womens\u2019 Day tweet, of course, is nothing new. Just days earlier, she was skewered on social media for a similar comment about Women\u2019s History Month.

      "text": "By Ankur Banerjee (Reuters) - U.S. health insurer Cigna Corp  said on Thursday it would buy pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co  for about $54 billion, the latest deal in the sector aimed at tackling soaring healthcare costs. The move follows the $69 billion merger of insurer Aetna Inc  and drugstore chain CVS Health Corp  announced last December, and highlights a sector-wide trend toward deals between companies that do not have directly overlapping operations. The deals seek to lower healthcare costs by bringing under one roof pharmacy and medical claims, and give the combined entities greater leverage in price negotiations with drugmakers. Cigna\u2019s offer consists of $48.75 in cash and 0.2434 shares of stock of the combined company for each Express Scripts share, amounting to $96.03 per share. That represents a premium of nearly 31 percent to Express Scripts\u2019 Wednesday closing price. Express Scripts shares were up 18.6 percent at $87.10, while Cigna shares were down 4.25 percent at $186. The transaction is valued at $67 billion, including about $15 billion in Express Scripts\u2019 debt, the company said. Pharmacy benefit managers administer prescription drug programs for health insurers, self-insured companies and government agencies, negotiating deals with drug manufacturers, working with pharmacies and processing claims. The CVS-Aetna deal was seen pressuring rival insurers, drugmakers, PBMs and retail pharmacies to consider mergers or switching partners to try to keep up with the potential healthcare cost savings or increase in profit margins. The wave of consolidation in the sector also comes in the backdrop of a shifting landscape, including changes in the U.S. Affordable Care Act, rising drug prices and the threat of competition from Amazon.com Inc . Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte said the deal may surprise investors given Cigna has said that they are satisfied with their PBM arrangement with UnitedHealth\u2019s  Optum unit.  It is possible that the threat of an Amazon entry into the healthcare and possibly the drug supply chain landscape, with the latest news of the Amazon/Berkshire Hathaway/JPMorgan employer coalition has spurred Cigna and Express Scripts to tie the knot.  Amazon, Berkshire Hathaway Inc  and JPMorgan Chase & Co  said in January they would form a company to cut health costs for hundreds of thousands of their employees. After the deal closes, Cigna shareholders will own about 64 percent of the combined company and Express Scripts shareholders the rest. Cigna intends to fund the cash portion of the deal through a combination of cash on hand, Express Scripts debt and new debt issuance. The company is expected to have debt of about $41.1 billion after the deal closes. The insurer said it obtained fully committed debt financing from Morgan Stanley Senior Funding and The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ Ltd for the deal. The combined company will be led by current Cigna Chief Executive Officer David Cordani. The deal comes a year after Cigna\u2019s deal to buy Anthem Inc  was blocked by antitrust regulators. Morgan Stanley was the financial adviser to Cigna and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz was the legal adviser. Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP is providing regulatory counsel. Centerview Partners and Lazard Fr\u00e8res were financial advisers to Express Scripts, with Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP serving as legal counsel and Holland & Knight LLP as regulatory counsel.

Feminism has become so trendy that major national brands are joining in, celebrating the female consumer\u2019s steady march toward gender equality even if their own corporate histories are marked by practices harmful to women.  Behold these examples:  Barbie Mattel has announced a new line of Barbie dolls modeled after inspirational women from history, including Frida Kahlo, Amelia Earhart and Kathleen Johnson, the NASA mathematician featured in the film  Hidden Figures.  Although the brand announced a line of  realistic  dolls back in 2016, the new ones appear to maintain the same rail-thin measurements that have fueled Barbie criticism for decades. Research has shown that Barbie\u2019s physique can have a negative impact on young girls\u2019 body image. Budweiser AdWeek reports that from Thursday through the end of March, Budweiser will honor contributions made by female employees by posting their photos on the company\u2019s social media pages.  Yet, in 2018, Budweiser still employs  Budweiser Girls,  the young, mostly white women who dress in skimpy clothing to promote the brand. The brewery also found itself in some hot water back in 2015 for a Bud Light ad campaign that struck many as tone-deaf in light of the emerging national discussion on sexual consent. Titled  Up for Whatever,  the campaign included labels printed with,  The perfect beer for removing \u2018no\u2019 from your vocabulary for the night.  Bud earned some good PR the following year for an ad highlighting equal pay. However, the company still counts just two women among its 13-member North American executive leadership team. ESPN A new 30-second spot from ESPN celebrates women\u2019s achievements in sports to promote the upcoming NCAA Women\u2019s Basketball Championship. Yet a 2017 Boston Globe expose detailed a culture of rampant sexism at the network. Women at ESPN reported feeling pressured to hide their pregnancies and take short maternity leaves in a professional environment where unwanted sexual advances by male colleagues were plentiful. Some men at ESPN openly rated women on their appearance, the Globe reported. ESPN has faced legal action over its work culture in the past, and just this week, former anchor Adrienne Lawrence filed a sexual harassment and discrimination lawsuit against the network. Let\u2019s also not forget ESPN\u2019s short-lived partnership with Barstool Sports, a website with a well-documented history of publishing content grossly disrespectful toward women.  Google Thursday\u2019s Google Doodle celebrates 12 female artists and encourages people to share stories about inspiring women in their own lives with the hashtag #HerStoryOurStory. A Google trends page, g.co/womensday, also shows how global interest in gender equality has increased. The Google Doodle team has a history of shining light on important women and people of color in history, but the tech giant as a whole is another matter. Last summer, Google faced questions over misogyny in its corporate environment after a memo written by a male employee was made public. The memo described how biology made women less successful in the tech industry and was circulated widely on Google\u2019s internal discussion boards for days without action by the company. While the memo\u2019s author was fired, the incident reportedly sparked a heated discussion on gender and discrimination within the company. Currently, Google faces a lawsuit over its alleged  bro culture  brought by a software engineer, Loretta Lee, who worked for the tech giant from 2008 to 2016.  McDonald\u2019s The fast-food staple flipped its golden arches across its numerous social media channels on Thursday, turning the iconic  M  into a  W.  (You know, for  women. ) Employees will also be able to wear  special hats and shirts  for the occasion.  Observers on social media have already called out the move as an empty gesture. As discussed by HuffPost\u2019s Willa Frej, sexual harassment is common in the fast-food industry, and McDonald\u2019s is no different. The chain has fostered  a company culture steeped in unfair treatment of women,  receiving sexual harassment complaints by workers in eight states in 2016. Two in five women experience sexual misconduct in fast-food jobs, according to a 2016 Hart Research study, yet many do not report the harassment for fear of losing work. "

The fast-food chain rolled out its altered logo across the company\u2019s social media channels on Thursday, and announced that 100 of its U.S. locations will feature special  packaging, crew shirts and hats and bag stuffers.  One California franchise actually flipped the arches on its outdoor signs in advance of Thursday\u2019s celebration.

In the U.S. we take pride in our diversity and we are proud to share that today, six out of 10 restaurant managers are women.  A closer look, however, exposes a company culture steeped in unfair treatment of women. Hourly workers in eight states filed complaints of sexual harassment against the chain in 2016. Workers reported having their breasts and posteriors groped, in addition to propositioning and lewd comments. One woman alleged that her boss texted her, offering $1,000 for oral sex.  One day, [my shift supervisor] Derek showed me a photo of his genitals. That was my breaking point,  said one plaintiff, Cycei Monae, who recounted that she was harassed by the boss daily. "

      "text": "Michelle Obama is back with more great life advice.  The former first lady recently interviewed four young women from around the world for an International Women\u2019s Day feature for Refinery29. In partnership with the Obama Foundation, Refinery29\u2032s feature spotlighted the four teenagers from Nepal, Ghana, Guatemala and Chicago to highlight the important of empowering girls with education.  Alejandra Teleguario Santizo, a 17-year-old from Guatemala who has organized her community to rally against sexual violence, asked Michelle Obama what advice she would give to young women like herself who are looking to blaze their own paths and become leaders.   My best advice to girls, including my own daughters, is do not be afraid to fail. So often, our own fear of failure is the thing that keeps us back,  Obama said.  We think we have to be perfect, that if we make even the tiniest mistake, it\u2019s a catastrophe. That\u2019s simply not true!  She added that the only way to succeed is life  is by failing and failing well.    You cannot let your failures eat you up or make you want to quit,  Obama said.  You have to learn from them, let them challenge and inspire you to do more \u2015 to take some risks and to step outside of your comfort zone.  Obama also told Santizo another important key to success: Be kind to other women.   I also advise girls to be supportive of each other. I cannot say this enough! Too often we\u2019re taught that we have to compete, or that someone else\u2019s failure is our success,  she said.  But we can all rise together; we can all win. We have to be a team of women and girls who love each other and value each other and cherish one another. Because if we don\u2019t cherish each other, no one else will.  Obama and her husband, former President Barack Obama, have been working to educate more girls around the world since they launched the Let Girls Learn initiative in 2015. The program brings together several international organizations to address the variety of challenges preventing girls from getting an education.  Eva Lewis, a 19-year-old activist and artist from the South Side of Chicago (where Obama also grew up), asked her how education can be liberating for everyone, but especially girls. Her answer did not disappoint.   I always tell students that if you focus on school right now, you will have all kinds of freedom later on in your life,  Obama said.  You\u2019ll have the freedom to choose a career you enjoy and to earn a living that supports your family. That is truly liberating. And that\u2019s not just true here in America.  When girls get an education, their whole world changes, Obama noted.  Right now, millions of adolescent girls around the world actually don\u2019t have the chance to go to school. Imagine if, at the age of 10 or 11 or 12, someone came to you and said, \u2018Sorry, you\u2019re a girl, you\u2019re finished with your education. Forget about all your dreams. Instead you\u2019ll marry a man twice your age and start having babies,\u2019  she said.  When we give girls an education, it can help liberate them from that kind of life. Educated girls marry later, have lower rates of infant and maternal mortality, and are more likely to immunize their children and less likely to contract malaria and HIV. Studies also show that girls who are educated earn higher salaries, and sending more girls to school and into the workforce can boost an entire country\u2019s GDP,  Obama continued.  So education can liberate individuals, families, and even nations.  Head over to Refinery29\u2032s feature and make sure to click through to read each individual interview.

      "text": "By Richard Tolman, University of Michigan / The Conversation Can President Donald Trump\u2019s recent repudiation of domestic violence actually help prevent it? Rob Porter, a high-level aide to Trump, was accused of serial domestic violence by his two ex-wives. The controversy dominated news coverage earlier this month. Trump publicly denounced domestic violence one week after Porter resigned, saying  I\u2019m totally opposed to domestic violence of any kind.  Those who called for such a statement by the president may be motivated by the belief that when powerful men convincingly call out abusers, society\u2019s acceptance of domestic violence can be diminished. There is not a lot of research to support this commonsense idea. But there is a growing body of work with men and boys that research shows can be effective in diminishing domestic violence. This is a significant evolution in the field. Since the establishment of the first domestic violence shelters in the 1970s, domestic violence policies and services have rightly focused most attention on survivors and meeting their needs for safety and healing. Increasingly, though, domestic violence organizations are adopting approaches that involve men and boys in domestic violence prevention. The idea is that by addressing the root causes, these programs can stop domestic violence from occurring in the first place. I am a professor who studies how to intervene and prevent men\u2019s violence against women. Our research team has researched the effectiveness of programs that involve boys and men in domestic violence prevention efforts. Much of the work being done with men and boys is not well-known, despite the fact that this is a thriving movement. Here is a snapshot of some of those efforts, both global and local, and what we know about their effectiveness. Some efforts to involve men are directed in the arena of sports because, well, men like sports. They venerate sports figures and identify with teams. Reports of domestic violence perpetrated by athletes have grown more common. This has led to visible efforts by sports organizations to respond with sanctions for perpetrators and to become part of prevention efforts, like the NFL\u2019s No More. The seriousness and effectiveness of these efforts are yet to be determined. But sports have also been the site of innovative and effective interventions for youth. Coaching Boys Into Men provides high school athletic coaches with the resources they need help prevent relationship abuse, harassment and sexual assault by their players. The program\u2019s curriculum includes coach-to-athlete trainings that model respect and promote healthy relationships. It also includes a card series to help coaches incorporate themes of teamwork, integrity, fair play and respect into their daily practice and routine. Coaching Boys Into Men has been rigorously evaluated, found to be effective in reducing dating violence, and is being widely implemented in the U.S. and replicated in other countries. A prime risk factor for future abuse is the exposure of children to violence. Preventing abuse in new families would reduce children\u2019s exposure to violence and thus the potential for future violence. One promising strategy is to involve men in prevention efforts as they move into fatherhood. Research shows that a caring and supportive relationship with their fathers reduces the risk of harsh physical discipline by the next generation of parents, both for fathers and mothers. Positive fathering predicts warmer and more positive parenting by adult sons when they become fathers. Strategies that could be used in this area include engaging men at prenatal visits such as ultrasound appointments, which the vast majority of men in the U.S. attend, and at in-home visits during pregnancy and after the birth of a child. Global campaigns such as MenCare seek to improve caregiving by fathers and address partner violence. MenCare\u2019s programs ask men to become more equitable partners and provide them with opportunities to learn and practice parenting skills. They promote policy change, like paid parental leave. And they conduct media campaigns to inspire men and their communities to support men\u2019s caregiving. Studies document high levels of dating violence beginning in middle school. When it comes to prevention, one could argue that programs must intervene early or the effort will be wasted, because stopping abuse before it becomes a entrenched pattern is more likely to be effective in preventing relationship violence. School-based abuse prevention programs like Safe Dates and Fourth R have shown some success in changing attitudes and behavior. The Safe Dates program, for example, uses nine 50-minute sessions, a student-performed 45-minute play and a poster contest, to explore topics on how to cultivate caring relationships, overcome gender stereotypes and help friends.  Bystander  prevention programs, increasingly commonplace on college campuses, build skills to recognize, respond to, and disrupt behavior that might lead to sexual assault or intimate partner violence. Some examples of bystander behavior include telling a man who is saying disrespectful things about women to stop or helping a woman who is being harassed to get away from a situation in which she could be harmed. Teens involved in bystander interventions are more likely to intervene to prevent victimization of their peers. Our research group surveyed men around the world who have been involved in efforts to prevent violence against women. The survey revealed that many men who get involved have a personal experience with violence \u2013 as child witnesses or survivors of their own child abuse. Still others find their way to prevention efforts through a commitment to social justice. Importantly, we found that many men are receptive to violence prevention efforts when they tune in to survivors\u2019 experiences. Given that men are moved by learning about survivors\u2019 experiences, the visibility of and emotional power of the #MeToo movement and the remarkable and vivid accounts of White House aide Rob Portman\u2019s ex-wives can lead men to get involved in ending violence against women. Whatever the pathway, men\u2019s involvement in preventing domestic violence in their families, workplaces and communities can be part of the global effort to promote safety and equality for women, and to end victimization in all its forms.

Students and school staff flooded social media with photos and videos from Wade\u2019s visit. The shooting guard, who has called for gun safety in the wake of the massacre, spoke as students excitedly crowded around him.  I just wanted to come and say I\u2019m inspired by all of you,  Wade told the students, many of whom are involved in organizing the upcoming March for Our Lives to demand stronger gun legislation.   As someone out here in the public eye, I\u2019m proud to say I\u2019m from this state because of you guys, because of the future of this world because of you guys,  he continued.

      "text": "A man accused of raping a Yale classmate on Halloween 2015 was found not guilty Wednesday by a New Haven, Connecticut, jury after a trial of less than two weeks. A woman referred to only as Jane Doe, now 24, accused Saifullah Khan, now 25, of raping her in her dorm room after she had vomited multiple times from drinking too much alcohol. Khan said that Doe had initiated the sexual encounter, which she said she barely remembered. Khan was found not guilty on all charges of sexual assault in the first, second, third and fourth degrees after his lawyers cast doubt on Doe\u2019s memory and called attention to her clothing. The defense also alleged that Yale officials had influenced the investigation carried out by the university\u2019s own police force, in an effort to prove that Yale took sexual assault seriously.  Research shows that sexual assault occurs on college campuses nationwide, yet relatively few incidents are reported to authorities and even fewer make it to trial. Just how few is unknown. According to the anti-sexual violence organization RAINN, 11.2 percent of undergraduate and graduate students experience rape or sexual assault through physical force, violence or incapacitation. Yet a whopping 89 percent of colleges reported zero incidents of rape in 2015, according to a May 2017 American Association of University Women report using data from the Department of Education. Doe and Khan were both seniors at the time of the alleged assault. While Doe has graduated, Khan, an Afghanistan native studying cognitive science, was suspended in November 2015 and has not returned to the school.  A jury heard testimony from Doe, Khan, law enforcement and various witnesses beginning Feb. 26. Doe told the jurors that she became inebriated after consuming two rum-and-cokes, one shot of hard liquor and two cups of wine at a 2015 Halloween party, the Yale Daily News reported. Her friends testified that she did not typically drink very much, if at all, according to the New Haven Register. Later in the evening, Doe accompanied friends to a Yale Symphony Orchestra concert, but said she vomited at the show and left to use the bathroom. After she was denied re-entry due to her intoxication, Doe said she went back to her dorm, accompanied by Khan. When they got to her room, Doe said Khan restrained and raped her. She also said that Khan took her phone and sent text messages to her friends to let them know she made it back safely. Khan denied the rape accusation and characterized their sexual encounter as consensual, the Register reported. In Khan\u2019s telling, Doe did not appear too intoxicated to consent. The pair had flirted during the concert, he said. When they returned to her dorm, Khan said she did not appear to have difficulty walking. Khan\u2019s attorney Norm Pattis offered an alternate explanation for surveillance footage showing his client supporting Doe as she appeared to stagger forward, the Register wrote.  How many times have you seen young lovers walk across campus in just such a pose? Does it look to you like two lovers out for a stroll?  Pattis asked the jury. Doe testified that she went to a sexual assault counseling center following the alleged incident and then to a hospital to be tested for venereal disease. Hospital photos of bruises on Doe\u2019s legs were shown in court.  What transformed that night from happy into a nightmare was she miscalculated her own tolerance for alcohol,  Supervisory Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Michael Pepper said in his closing arguments.  She ate too little and drank too much. But that\u2019s not criminal. And it doesn\u2019t absolve the defendant,  he said. In his closing argument, Pattis drew attention to Doe\u2019s outfit that night, a  short skirt and tube top,  and suggested she was  dressed to party.   She made up this story because she can\u2019t face the fact that the one night when she took a walk on the wild side, she\u2019s got to face her friends the next day,  Pattis said.  I think she let her friends convince her she\u2019d been raped.  A representative for the prosecutor\u2019s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Trials over alleged sexual assault on campus may become even less frequent under Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, who last year ordered her department to roll back Obama-era rules that aimed to reform systemic mishandling of such cases under Title IX. (Title IX requires the Department of Education to protect students from gender-based discrimination, including sexual harassment and assault.) The department\u2019s Office of Civil Rights also issued a memo last July instructing staff to scale back their investigations at public schools and universities, including in sexual assault cases.

      "text": "Last year during a home game against the Atlanta Hawks, Kevin Love of the Cleveland Cavaliers experienced his first panic attack. The episode not only forced the NBA power forward to leave the game at halftime, it forced him to open up about his struggle with mental health. In an essay for the Players\u2019 Tribune published Tuesday, the 29-year-old athlete detailed what happened when he was hospitalized mid-game in November, how he suffered silently and why he\u2019s speaking out about mental health now.  It came out of nowhere. I\u2019d never had one before. I didn\u2019t even know if they were real,  Love wrote of his panic attack.   But it was real \u2014 as real as a broken hand or a sprained ankle. Since that day, almost everything about the way I think about my mental health has changed.  While Love detailed his panic attack in November, his essay didn\u2019t mention what happened when he left a Jan. 22 game due to an undisclosed illness and later missed a practice. His teammates were reportedly upset over his absences, though things settled down once Love explained to the team during a meeting what was going on, ESPN reported at the time. After Love\u2019s essay was published, Cleveland.com reported Tuesday that Love had disclosed his panic attacks during that meeting. Love said he had recovered from the November incident and performed successfully at a game two days later, but something else had begun troubling him:  Why was I so concerned with people finding out?   Love eventually found help through therapy, which he said he had never thought he\u2019d pursue. Through those sessions, Love wrote, he discovered issues beyond the pressures of the NBA that were weighing him down, including the death of his grandmother.  In the short time I\u2019ve been meeting with the therapist, I\u2019ve seen the power of saying things out loud in a setting like that,  Love wrote.  And it\u2019s not some magical process. It\u2019s terrifying and awkward and hard, at least in my experience so far.  Love said he was inspired to speak out about his mental health issues after the Toronto Raptors\u2019 DeMar DeRozan revealed last month that he has been struggling with depression, feelings of loneliness and anxiety. DeRozan hinted at his issues in a tweet in late February, then later expanded on his experience in an interview with The Toronto Star.  This is real stuff,  DeRozan told the Star.  We\u2019re all human at the end of the day. The Toronto guard added,  My mom always told me: Never make fun of anybody because you never know what that person is going through.  In his essay, Love said that men especially need to know it\u2019s OK to speak up about their feelings \u2015 something he had been uncomfortable with for most of his life.  If you\u2019re suffering silently like I was, then you know how it can feel like nobody really gets it,  Love wrote, before noting what pushed him to write his piece. Partly, I want to do it for me, but mostly, I want to do it because people don\u2019t talk about mental health enough. And men and boys are probably the farthest behind. The stigma around mental health is a very serious problem for men. A 2015 survey found that men are more likely than women to hide thoughts of suicide. And, according to the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, white men accounted for 7 out of 10 suicides in 2016, while the rate of suicide is highest for middle-aged men. Love addressed this in his essay, calling it an invisible struggle men have to face.  Look, I\u2019m probably not telling you anything new here,  Love wrote.  These values about men and toughness are so ordinary that they\u2019re everywhere \u2026 and invisible at the same time, surrounding us like air or water,  he added.  They\u2019re a lot like depression or anxiety in that way.  Loves\u2019 teammates, and other NBA players, have praised Love for being courageous enough to speak up about his struggles. Now, in response to all of the support, the Cavaliers\u2019 forward is asking for others to share their own stories with him. Read Love\u2019s full essay on mental health here. "

      "text": "Geek Squad employees have been working as FBI informants for more than a decade, newly released documents show, revealing a much closer relationship between the two organizations than formerly reported. While we\u2019d previously known some of the Best Buy workers alerted law enforcement whenever they found illegal material like child pornography on customers\u2019 hard drives, the new documents show that the FBI met with the Geek Squad team at least as early as 2008 and apparently viewed some workers as paid informants. The Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a Freedom of Information Act request for the documents last year and released them on Tuesday. The Bureau refused to confirm or deny if it has similar relationships with other electronics repair companies.  The documents indicate Geek Squad technicians only flagged federal agents when they found child pornography on a client\u2019s computer, so it\u2019s hard to be too upset. Nevertheless, it raises concerning questions about potential violations of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s protection against unreasonable searches and seizures.  Seeking to calm fears, a Best Buy spokesperson told HuffPost in an emailed statement that their technicians do not actively search for such content and only discover it inadvertently. But in at least one instance, that doesn\u2019t seem to be the case. Per the EFF, an illicit image found on the hard drive of Mark Rettenmaier, a California doctor who dropped off his computer at a Best Buy in 2011, was stored on unallocated space on the disk that  typically requires forensic software to find.  Rettenmaier was tried in 2017 on felony child pornography charges, but the case was thrown out after U.S. District Judge Cormac Carney ruled the FBI warrant that allowed the search of Rettenmaier\u2019s home \u2015 a warrant granted based on the image found by Geek Squad \u2015 was obtained via  false and misleading statements.   EFF documents show this wasn\u2019t a one-off case, and that the FBI handled numerous incidents in similar fashion after being alerted by Geek Squad technicians at the company\u2019s repair facility in Kentucky. (The company\u2019s Kentucky Geek Squad City facility handles more serious repairs, including work like data recovery that could require them to sift through a customer\u2019s data.) Records uncovered as a result of the Rettenmaier case show the Bureau had  eight FBI informants at Geek Squad City  from 2007-2012, and that some Geek Squad employees were paid between $500 and $1,000 for their help. At least one Geek Squad technician attempted to give the money back and was rebuffed. In an emailed statement to HuffPost, Best Buy sought to temper concerns about possibly illegal searches, saying the company has both a moral and, in some cases, legal obligation to alert authorities when employees find child pornography \u2015 as it does  nearly 100 times a year.  Customers are also made aware of the policy in writing prior to Geek Squad beginning any repair.  As a company, we have not sought or received training from law enforcement in how to search for child pornography,  the company said.  Our policies prohibit employees from doing anything other than what is necessary to solve the customer\u2019s problem. In the wake of these allegations, we have redoubled our efforts to train employees on what to do \u2014 and not do \u2014 in these circumstances.   We have learned that four employees may have received payment after turning over alleged child pornography to the FBI,  the company continued.  Any decision to accept payment was in very poor judgement and inconsistent with our training and policies. Three of these employees are no longer with the company and the fourth has been reprimanded and reassigned.  "

I hope he rots in hell,  Moore, 18, said of Nassar on NBC News\u2019  Today  show on Tuesday.  Nassar has been accused of abusing over 260 young girls and women during decades as team doctor for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State University. He\u2019s now serving three concurrent sentences of up to 175 years on child sexual abuse and child pornography charges. Moore became the first male to accuse Nassar in a federal lawsuit filed last week alleging the former doctor molested him in 2016. Moore, now a freshman at the University of Michigan, said Nassar abused him under the guise of treatment for a shoulder injury when he was 16 years old.  I wasn\u2019t a dumb kid, I knew kind of what medical practices were and that one was out of the ordinary,  Moore said Tuesday.  Coming out of the treatment, I felt very uncomfortable.   Moore said he  kind of freaked out  when abuse allegations against Nassar became public, and he couldn\u2019t find an explanation for the treatment he received.  Moore\u2019s sister, who also has accused Nassar of abusing her, testified during a January sentencing hearing for the doctor in which she mentioned her brother had been victimized. Both siblings are gymnasts.  My whole family was fooled by you, but I know now who you really are,  Kamerin Moore told the serial predator. Jacob Moore said his entire family has been affected by Nassar\u2019s abuse.  Me and my sister shouldn\u2019t be able to relate over the fact that we\u2019ve both been abused,  he said.  That\u2019s just really sickening to me, that he would violate our trust like that \u2026 the things that he did were just awful.   President Donald Trump recently signed a bill that aims to protect amateur athletes from sexual assault in the wake of the Nassar scandal. In January, Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette (R) announced that his office will conduct an  independent, thorough, transparent and prompt  investigation into MSU and its handling of the Nassar case. Education Secretary Betsy DeVos also has said the Department of Education will investigate how MSU handled the Nassar allegations. "

      "text": "In the days after three UCLA men\u2019s basketball players were arrested in China for allegedly shoplifting during a November visit, emails and letters poured in to university Chancellor Gene Block from angry fans, alumni and people with no connection to the school at all. There were hundreds and hundreds of messages, some written with perfect grammar and sober typefaces, others screeching and incoherent and laid out in Comic Sans. One author, a self-identified former UCLA crew letterman, somberly informed the chancellor that he was enclosing his old varsity sweater.  The three players \u2015 LiAngelo Ball, Cody Riley and Jalen Hill \u2015 are black. Was the furious reaction about race? Not at all, said one correspondent, a little unconvincingly:  My decision is not based on the color of the skin of these thieves. Of my six grandchildren four are biracial.  Very much so, said another:  Don\u2019t surprise me you LOOK LIKE A FUDGPACKING FAGGOT !@ YOU SHOULD BE SO PROUD, 3 MONKEYS GETTING FREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE RIDE AND EMBARRASS YO SCHOOL BY ACTING LIKE THE NIGGERS THEY APPARENTLY ARE !   And on and on they went, the emails nearly universal in their disdain for the athletes. Many of them were clearly spurred on by the involvement of President Donald Trump, who was just then initiating a feud with LaVar Ball, father of LiAngelo. HuffPost obtained the emails via a public records request, and in them the whole modern American backlash is on display. Expressions of lofty disapproval, bloodthirsty formalism, coded racism, frank racism \u2014 hey, hey, the gang\u2019s all here.  They have embarrassed their country as well as their race,  read one note.  They put shame on UCLA, their race and our country,  read another.  3 JERKS \u2014 DISGRACED THE COLLEGE \u2014 OUR COUNTRY AND THEIR RACE!  read a third, this one a handwritten letter. The full collection of emails and letters, all 637 pages, appears at the bottom of this post. First, some background: Ball, Riley and Hill, all freshmen, were arrested on Nov. 7 during the UCLA team\u2019s early-season trip to China to play Georgia Tech. The players, according to Chinese authorities and later by their own admissions, had stolen sunglasses and other merchandise from three department stores in Hangzhou.  On Nov. 15, Block and UCLA suspended the players indefinitely. Ball has since left the program to play professionally overseas. Hill and Riley are serving one-season suspensions.  The arrests became a national story in part because of Trump, who claimed credit for helping the players avoid a possible 10-year prison sentence in China. Some of the emails sent to Block took their cues from Trump\u2019s version of events.  Never again should anyone be allowed to commit a crime where President Trump has to come to UCLA\u2019s rescue. It is absolutely disgusting,  one correspondent wrote.  The man who probably stands against just about everything the UCLA community defends comes to the rescue of people who unfortunately are associated with UCLA.  ESPN has since reported that UCLA officials had resolved the issue with Chinese authorities before they heard from Trump or White House Chief of Staff John Kelly.  It was a simple case of minor theft, but from the wailing of the emails you might have thought the players had rampaged through the Forbidden City. Nothing short of the total annihilation of the young men\u2019s academic and professional lives would suffice in the eyes of many of the emailers. The players deserved the full force of American (and perhaps even Chinese) law for having swiped and ultimately returned a few pairs of sunglasses and other merchandise. One emailer told Block to  recommend that they not be rewarded with any professional contracts.  Time and again, emailers returned to the theme that the players were  entitled  athletes who didn\u2019t truly belong in college, especially not one as prestigious as UCLA. This racist exceptionalism \u2015 the idea that black men can only earn their way into college through athletic talent \u2015 flows in part from the reality of the school\u2019s population. Black men make up only about 3 percent of the male student body at UCLA, and a majority of them are athletes. As a viral video produced by students noted, the university has had more national sports championships in its history than it had black male freshmen in 2013\u2019s enrollment class.   In the emails, the usual racial code words were frequently deployed. The athletes were called some variation of  entitled  or  spoiled  nearly 50 times.  Stupid,   arrogant  and  above the law  also appeared regularly. There were at least 18 uses of  thug,  as in  entitled millionaire thugs,  in 14 separate emails. The players were also labeled  ingrates,   fucking embarrassing morons,   miscreant prima donnas  and  reprobates.  More than a dozen times, emailers explicitly referenced their own status as  taxpayers,  as if to suggest (in one writer\u2019s view) that they were tired of  subsidizing  athletes like Ball, Riley and Hill. And sometimes, the emailers dispensed with the racial coding altogether. One subject line:  Black Basketball Thieves.  Another message declared that what the players did was  Super-Idiocy!  It went on:  And you\u2019re going to let these morons earn a college degree at UCLA? Looks like they fulfill the stereotype of a \u2018simpleton black athlete.\u2019  The batch of emails included one that seemed to link the players to Michael Brown, the teenager shot and killed by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014.  It\u2019s when people like them get away with stealing from shops that people like [redacted] feel just as entitled to do the same in Missouri.   In the documents provided to HuffPost, UCLA appears to have redacted the players\u2019 names and any specific identification of them, as a way of formally protecting their identities. But you don\u2019t need a decoder ring to figure out what these passages are trying to say (sic throughout): UCLA must send a strong message on what it expects from such role models \u2015 let\u2019s not lie to ourselves, that\u2019s what they are to millions of young [redacted] males. It\u2019s when people like them get away with stealing from shops that people like [redacted] feel just as entitled to do the same in Missouri. Then he gets angry when someone tries to stop him, and he charges at the cop \u2015 and gets shot. It all starts when responsible institutions like UCLA give up on their responsibilities. Expel the thugs! Stealing designer sunglasses from Louis Vuitton in China while our president Trump is visiting is NOT who we are as a nation, but it is definitely who they are, a bunch of knuckleheads, lowlifes, thugs, and [redacted] with attitude. Why would you ever let trash like that out of the country?? It aint no big deal! No other country in the world would take the crap that we do from a minority 13% of a population for the majority of crime and other A-Z Any other minority in the US seem to be able to make it along with a moral compass. Not to excuse slavery but for decade\u2019s now [redacted] that wants to half way follow the program will make it. Its time to not hear any more excuses and crutching! These three should not get a pass, just because of the color of their skin. If they are attending your university on scholarships I strongly suggest they loose them. They can turn to their hero Colin Kaepernick, GQ\u2019s Citizen of the Year for help. What they did was not just stupid, it was ghetto and criminal, and we have no doubt that if there is another LA riot that they will be looting and vandalizing with their brothers. Congratulations for continuing to show China what American atheltes exist in this country. To some emailers, it was clear that the three players were experienced criminals ... I can only assume they have never been held accountable because they can shoot a ball into a basket. For these athletes to steal with the comfort level displayed showed they clearly had done this before. Pampered puss ants who probably let their trouser snakes out on campus screwing anything they see! FUCK EM!! ... and that they weren\u2019t good enough students to be at UCLA in the first place: Two of the fellows could hardly speak english. And did you notice that your student athletes had trouble reading their prepared statements? Shame on UCLA. How did these students get into UCLA in the first place? I bet it probably wasn\u2019t scholastics. \u2026 Dumber than a 2nd coat of paint! I am embarrassed when your student athletics, like your arrested basketball players and even last year\u2019s player [redacted] give interviews and use the word  ain\u2019t  . Children at age four learn that  ain\u2019t  is not proper grammar and unacceptable. This example simply proves you have no regard for even teaching you student-athletics basic English grammar. Stop the nonsense. It is an embarrassment to our country and your so called  education system  (what in the world are you teaching them anyway?) to have such reprobates representing us in foreign countries.  For too long California taxpayers have been subsidizing free education for questionable athletes/students. ... There needs to be more vetting of these student athletes, background checks, and general review of their understanding of civics and ethics, before California Taxpayers continue to subsidize these people. At a minimum, remove them from the basketball team. Of course this really means remove them from UCLA as they have no other use to be there since they can\u2019t play basketball. I\u2019m sick of paying for a full SCHOLARSHIP for future wifebeater/ drug dealing, criminal scum who get away with stuff that have a normal person in jail for 20 years, but they are  Great ballplayers , so they get to skate free.  Some even suggested the players were indicative of everything wrong with American culture by comparing them to Harvey Weinstein and other famous people implicated in sexual harassment and assault cases: [T]hey are toxic to the school and the sport just like serial sex predator Harvey Weinstein who is now a Hollywood pariah  UCLA cannot stand by and turn a blind eye to this disgrace...it is akin to the many in the entertainment industry whom allowed Harvey Weinstein and his ilk to victimize individuals in the name of money and fame. \u2026  I must insist - no, demand - that these disgraceful, criminal thugs be permanently expelled from UCLA for their heinous behavior and criminal acts. I\u2019m particularly troubled by what appears to be the emerging excuse \u2013 that they\u2019re young men, who made a very foolish mistake. To me, that\u2019s a bit like Kevin Spacey coming out as gay when he\u2019s charged with sexual misconduct. Look at the news; Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and Louis C.K. The time to say enough is enough is now. For UCLA, if these young men are allowed to continue to be students there, at a time when entitlement is under such scrutiny because of the misdeeds in Washington, in Hollywood, news agencies, workplaces, academia and homes throughout the country, giving these players a pass adds insult to injury. Our moral and ethical scales are calibrated today to benefit the powerful over the ordinary. If they stay on campus, it may appear that UCLA is putting a thumb on the scale promoting star power at a time when we are at a moral crossroads. And some who emailed Block said that he and UCLA should have left the players in China to face legal proceedings and potential jail time there: I find it shameful that our President brought the thieving basketball players home. Hopefully they will go to jail in China. They rightfully deserved to be tried and punished under Chinese law. They deserve to be in a Chinese prison. Our country now owes a Communist country a favor. This is serious. This is one of the few times we have disagreed with the actions of the President. In our opinion, the young men should have received Chinese legal proceedings and suffered the consequences. Like a bubble gum chewer in China they should have been left to face a bamboo whip. Only a handful of the emails sent to Block suggested that the appropriate punishment for the petty crimes the players committed in China wasn\u2019t to ruin their entire lives.   Chancellor Block,  one person wrote,  Please do not give up on these young UCLA men. Stick by them & help them grow.  "

That\u2019s the gist of what philanthropist Melinda Gates says in an op-ed published Monday in Quartz, in which she announced that she and her husband, Bill Gates, are pledging $170 million to help empower women economically around the world. The money, from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, will be spent over four years  to help women exercise their economic power,  Melinda Gates wrote. She noted that research shows economic power is the  most promising entry points for gender equality.    Simply put when money flows into the hands of women who have the authority to use it, everything changes,  she wrote. Gates broke down how women\u2019s economic empowerment is key to gender equality, saying families benefit when women control household finances.   Research shows ... that women are much more likely than men to buy things that set their families on a pathway out of poverty, like nutritious food, health care, and education,  Gates wrote.  Additionally, Gates noted, when women have economic power, communities begin to rethink the roles women play in society.   Women acting on their own can do what all the philanthropic organizations in the world can never accomplish: change the unwritten rule that women are lesser than men,  she wrote.  Our role, as we see it, is to make targeted investments that give women the opportunity to write new rules.  According to the op-ed, the donation will fund a three-pronged approach to economically empowering women: First, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation will support and organize female farmers so they can sell their products at competitive prices; Second, the foundation will work in eight countries, including India, Pakistan and Tanzania, to promote women using digital bank accounts; And lastly, the foundation will facilitate self-help groups allowing women and girls share information about  everything from launching a small business to raising healthy children.

The one-minute video aired during the 90th Academy Awards, which took place in Los Angeles on Sunday night. The ad, which was the platform\u2019s first-ever Oscars commercial, was shot in black and white and promotes diverse representation and women\u2019s empowerment.  The ad features queer poet Denice Frohman performing a spoken-word poem as the faces of strong and influential women flash across the screen. Director Ava DuVernay, actress Issa Rae, Oracle executive Jennifer Renaud and Twitter\u2019s senior director of marketing and communications, Nola Weinstein, all appear in the video.   I heard a woman becomes herself the first time she speaks without permission,  Frohman begins her poem.  Then every word out her mouth, a riot. Say beautiful and point to the map of your body. Say brave and wear your skin like a gown.  Twitter announced the ad on its platform, writing:  We stand with women around the world to make their voices heard and their presence known. To bring them front and center, today and every day.   Many Twitter users thought the ad was somewhat hypocritical, however, because the platform has done little to curb any type of online harassment, especially that against women. According to a 2015 study, 88 percent of social media harassment occurs on Twitter. While there are many types of harassers online, much of the vitriol has historically targeted women. It often includes body-shaming comments, sexist language and even rape and death threats. Although Twitter has taken steps recently to prevent online harassment and bullying, many users still believe more needs to be done. While many people applauded the powerful ad, dozens of women tweeted their disappointment on Sunday night.   #HereWeAre, still watching as Twitter does little to nothing about the rampant misogyny & racism that infects this space,  feminist author Jessica Valenti tweeted.  Jewish activist and feminist Rebeccs Krevat pointed out that the ad was very powerful, but problematic.

U.S. District Judge Kiyo Matsumoto in Brooklyn said the assets Shkreli could forfeit to satisfy the judgment also include $5 million in a brokerage account and his stake in Vyera Pharmaceuticals, one of the drug companies he founded. Shkreli is scheduled to be sentenced for securities fraud on Friday. A lawyer for Shkreli could not immediately be reached for comment on the judge\u2019s order. Shkreli, 34, has been in jail since September, when Matsumoto revoked his bail after he offered a $5,000 bounty for a strand of Hillary Clinton\u2019s hair in a Facebook post. Shkreli became notorious as the Pharma Bro  when he raised the price of anti-parasitic drug Daraprim by over 5,000 percent in 2015 while he was chief executive officer of Turing Pharmaceuticals. Turing is now Vyera. In December 2015, Shkreli told Bloomberg Businessweek that he had bought the Wu-Tang Clan\u2019s Once Upon a Time in Shaolin  when the hip-hop group auctioned the sole copy of the album to the highest bidder. Bloomberg reported that he paid $2 million for it. Shkreli has also boasted of owning a Picasso painting. A jury found Shkreli guilty last August of securities fraud charges unrelated to Daraprim. They determined that he lied to investors about the performance of two hedge funds he ran, MSMB Capital and MSMB Healthcare. He also was found guilty of conspiring to manipulate the stock price of another drug company he founded, Retrophin Inc (RTRX.O). Shkreli\u2019s lawyers have asked that he be sentenced to 12 to 18 months in prison. They argued in a court filing that a lenient sentence is warranted partly because the investors eventually came out ahead when Shkreli paid them in stock and cash from Retrophin. Matsumoto has already ruled that when Shkreli is sentenced, he will be held responsible for $10.4 million in losses, including all of the money his investors entrusted to his hedge funds. She said that regardless of the investors\u2019 ultimate gains, Shkreli got their money in the first place through fraud. Although the $10.4 million loss will result in a higher recommended sentence under federal guidelines, Matsumoto is not required to follow those guidelines. "

I started to cry backstage when I was telling them [the movie\u2019s cast] how much the film meant to me as a woman, but how much it meant to me as a mother,  she said.  That says a lot about where we are in this world and in the world of superheroes.  Bullock is the mother of two black children, Louis Bardo Bullock and Laila Bullock.

Bullock said her children were still too young to see the critically acclaimed film, but her daughter apparently really loves wearing the  Black Panther  mask:  I bought her swag before it even came on. She runs around in the \u2018Black Panther\u2019 mask. Which is scary when she comes out of the dark.  "

ESPN reported Friday that the three University of California, Los Angeles basketball players, who were allegedly caught shoplifting in China, were already scheduled to return home by the time Chief of Staff John Kelly said the White House was getting involved. LiAngelo Ball, Jalen Hill and Cody Riley were in China for a game at the time of their arrests. To recreate a timeline of the arrests, ESPN\u2019s reporters spent three months conducting interviews with sources close to the team who were in China at the time of the incident.  The situation was already resolved by the time we heard about Trump\u2019s involvement,  one source told ESPN.  That\u2019s not to take away from the fact that he got involved, but the players already had their passports back and their flights booked to go home Tuesday night when Gen. Kelly called the players.  Earlier reports claimed the basketball players were released after Trump spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping. Trump reportedly brought the issue up with Xi at a dinner during a visit to Beijing in November. The incident sparked a feud between Trump and LiAngelo Ball\u2019s father, LaVar Ball. In an interview with CNN, Lavar said he\u2019d rather thank Xi than Trump. He also expressed skepticism that Trump orchestrated his son\u2019s release.  Did he help the boys get out? I don\u2019t know,  Ball said during the interview.  If I was going to thank somebody, I\u2019d probably thank President Xi. He\u2019s the president in China. Somebody can make a suggestion and somebody can do something.  During their feud, Trump called Ball  very ungrateful  and claimed he was not taking his son\u2019s shoplifting charges seriously enough.

      "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - Roger Bannister, who has died aged 88, will live forever in the annals of athletics history as the first man to run a mile in under four minutes. A statement from his family on Sunday said:  Sir Roger Bannister, died peacefully in Oxford on 3 March, aged 88, surrounded by his family who were as loved by him, as he was loved by them. ... He banked his treasure in the hearts of his friends.  British Prime Minister Theresa May led the tributes to the former athlete, who later became one of Europe\u2019s leading neurologists and was made a knight.  Sir Roger Bannister was a great British sporting icon whose achievements were an inspiration to us all. He will be greatly missed,  she said on Twitter. The record-breaking run was on the Oxford University track during a local athletics meeting with only a few spectators witnessing the Englishman\u2019s destruction of the myth that no human being could run so fast. Bannister made headlines around the world at the age of 25. His achievement opened the physical and psychological door for many other milers who have since beaten his time of three minutes 59.4 seconds. Roger Gilbert Bannister, born in Harrow, a London suburb, on March 23, 1929, was a shy, gangling medical student who preferred to be an oarsman rather than a runner. In 1946, when he went to Oxford, his great ambition was to row against Cambridge in the annual boat race on the Thames. But Bannister, who stood 1.8 meters tall and weighed only 68 kilograms, was told he was too light to make a first-rate oarsman. So he turned to running and his new ambition became to win the 1,500 meters at the Olympic Games in Helsinki in 1952. Bannister started a five-year build-up and in 1947 at the age of 17 at Oxford ran his first mile race, finishing second in a time of just over five minutes. Later that year he won the mile for Oxford against Cambridge in an athletics meeting. The world record was gradually being whittled down and a number of athletes were considered capable of crashing the four-minute barrier. "

Those are two big takeaways from a new working paper by a group of researchers led by Stephen Zoepf, executive director of the Center for Automotive Research at Stanford University and a researcher at the MIT Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, which found that a substantial percentage of drivers for ride-hailing companies probably earn less than they think they do, though their wages are padded thanks to per-mile tax deductions. As a working paper, it\u2019s important to note the figures haven\u2019t been peer-reviewed and are subject to change. Nevertheless, it offers interesting insight into an industry where driver pay has been the subject of much scrutiny. Unlike previous economic analyses that report drivers\u2019 gross profits without factoring in operational costs, the MIT paper takes into account how much drivers spend on things like insurance, maintenance, repairs, fuel and the car\u2019s depreciation in value, using data from Edmunds, Kelley Blue Book and the Environmental Protection Agency.  Once those costs are accounted for, the working paper found, 74 percent of ride-hailing drivers make less than the minimum wage in their states, and 30 percent of drivers actually lose money for every mile they drive. In the survey of 1,121 drivers, the median driver earned $0.59 per mile and paid out $0.30 per mile in vehicle costs, leading to a median hourly profit of $3.37.  Notably, a choice few drivers with the most efficient vehicles and running the most profitable routes were able to turn out revenue of $1.50 per mile. Zoepf told HuffPost the Toyota Prius, a gas/electric hybrid, was drivers\u2019 vehicle of choice by a factor of two. More than 80 percent of the drivers surveyed said they work less than 40 hours per week. It isn\u2019t all bad news for drivers, however. The paper found nearly half of all drivers can declare a loss for tax purposes at the federal tax deduction rate of roughly $0.54 per mile. Per the researchers, that drastically decreases the amount of taxable income drivers need to report, to the extent that an estimated 74 percent of driver profit \u2015 representing billions of dollars \u2015 is going untaxed.  At an average of $661/month in net profit per driver and with hundreds of thousands of drivers in the U.S. alone, the standard mileage deduction facilitates billions of dollars of untaxed income, and hundreds of millions of unrealized tax revenue,  the paper notes.  This untaxed profit represents a social subsidy for the ride-hailing business model.  Lyft didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment from HuffPost, but a spokesman for Uber vigorously disputed the paper\u2019s methodology and findings.  While the paper is certainly attention grabbing, its methodology and findings are deeply flawed,  the spokesman said.  We\u2019ve reached out to the paper\u2019s authors to share our concerns and suggest ways we might work together to refine their approach.  Zoepf didn\u2019t immediately respond to followup questions about his methodology. Compared to other studies that used different methodology, the MIT paper is indeed an outlier. A National Bureau of Economic Research study in November 2016 found drivers in six major metropolitan areas earned around $18 an hour, not taking into account hourly costs varying from $2.94 to $6.46 per hour depending on the hours they worked and the vehicle they drove. The paper also received some scrutiny from Harry Campbell, founder of The Rideshare Guy, an industry blog. Campbell\u2019s 2017 Reader Survey provided the hard data the researchers used for their paper. Using the same data, Campbell came up with an average hourly rate of around $16 an hour, not taking drivers\u2019 operational costs into account. But, he said, even if MIT\u2019s methodology needs to be tweaked \u2015 which is possible, since it\u2019s a working paper \u2015 its fundamental finding is spot on: Drivers aren\u2019t making enough money.   Many drivers are doing this job part time and really only looking to make a few hundred bucks a week,  Campbell said,  but figuring out how much they are actually earning can be quite challenging.   I think that\u2019s why we see such high turnover, and the No. 1 reason we hear from drivers as to why they\u2019re quitting is because of lower-than-expected earnings.  "

The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in California but announced Friday, accuses the committee of bungling its response to sexual abuse allegations against Nassar, who is now serving a long prison term for sex crimes.   After all this time, they remain unwilling to conduct a full investigation, and without a solid understanding of how this happened, it is delusional to think sufficient changes can be implemented,  Raisman said in a statement, according to NBC.  I refuse to wait any longer for these organizations to do the right thing. It is my hope that the legal process will hold them accountable and enable the change that is so desperately needed.  A USA Gymnastics trainer was sometimes present during treatment sessions where Nassar abused young athletes at the Karolyi Ranch, Raisman alleges in the suit, according to NBC News.  Raisman, in recent interviews, has accused the USOC of ignoring allegations against Nassar and threatening her not to tell how he molested her under the guise of treatment.  I was told [by USA Gymnastics] to be quiet,  Raisman told ESPN in January.  And I think that when somebody in high power is telling you to be quiet, right when they realized you are abused, I think that that is a threat. USA Gymnastics just said, \u2018We\u2019re handling this. We got this. Like, stop asking us questions.\u2019  Raisman, a gold medalist who competed at the 2012 and 2016 Olympics, was among more than 100 women who alleged Nassar sexually abused them. He pleaded guilty to child pornography and sexual assault charges and was sentenced to lengthy prison terms.  The USOC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The group\u2019s CEO, Scott Blackmun, resigned on Wednesday after a cancer diagnosis.  Under his leadership, USOC has focused nearly all its efforts on money and medals while the safety of our athletes has taken a back seat,  attorney John Manly, who represents many of Nassar\u2019s victims, including Raisman, said in a statement.

Jacob Moore, a former member of the U.S. junior team and now a gymnast at University of Michigan, said in a federal lawsuit filed Wednesday in Michigan that Nassar molested him in 2016, when he was 16 years old, according to multiple news outlets. The suit was first reported by International Gymnast magazine on Thursday. Moore says in his lawsuit that Nassar applied  acupuncture in his pubic area and in and around his genitalia  and  pulled down Moore\u2019s pants, exposing his genitalia  to a young female gymnast also present in the room. More than 100 women, including Olympic champion gymnasts, have alleged Nassar sexually abused them under the guise of treatment for decades, but Moore is the first male to come forward. Nassar pleaded guilty to child pornography and sexual assault charges in recent months and was sentenced to lengthy prison terms.  Moore\u2019s older sister Kamerin said Nassar also abused her. Kamerin Moore mentioned her brother during Nassar\u2019s sentencing hearing this year, recalling that she  watched him frantically search the Internet, trying to find some proof that the chi in his shoulder is somehow connected to his genitals.  The siblings joined a federal lawsuit against Nassar, USA Gymnastics and Michigan State. The filing says  there is no known medical connection between shoulder pain which can be treated through acupuncture in the area of a male\u2019s genitalia.  Moore\u2019s lawsuit adds to the litigation involving Nassar. The Olympic gold medalist Aly Raisman filed suit against the U.S. Olympic Committee this week for failing to take action to prevent the abuse.  The USOC\u2019s Scott Blackmun stepped down as CEO this week amid investigations into whether the organization\u2019s officials knew about the allegations and attempted a cover-up.  CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misidentified where Jacob Moore is a gymnast. It is the University of Michigan, not Michigan State University. "

The declaration prompted a funny response on Wednesday from Spurs Coach Gregg Popovich. At an MIT Sports Analytics Conference in Boston, Obama said that as a player he would seek out the five-time champion Spurs because they satisfy his checklist for ideal organizations.  They\u2019re smart, they\u2019re well-run, they\u2019re focused on team,  he said (listen in the sound clip below).

Obama\u2019s shoutout did not go unnoticed by the Spurs\u2019 coach, who happens to be a critic of President Donald Trump and a socially conscious fellow. He also has a sense of humor.

Pizza Hut\u2019s new status as sponsor was announced just one day after the league and Papa John\u2019s released a joint statement saying the two had parted ways. Pizza Hut and the NFL reached a multiyear agreement that will offer  exclusive marketing rights and designations that will connect the brand with the NFL and its teams, players, events, [and] partners,  the league said Wednesday. Papa John\u2019s has had a rocky few months. Founder John Schnatter, who supported Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, expressed his displeasure in November about NFL players taking a knee during the national anthem to protest police brutality and systemic racial injustice. Schnatter claimed the league\u2019s handling of the protests was responsible for Papa John\u2019s softening sales. That commentary resulted in bad publicity and still more poor sales for Papa John\u2019s, ultimately leading to Schnatter\u2019s resignation as CEO toward the end of last year. He is still the company\u2019s chairman. Twitter users (and many members of the NFL) have been particularly saucy about Wednesday\u2019s news: Now... who\u2019s hungry? "

      "text": "Scott Blackmun is stepping down from his post as CEO of the U.S. Olympic Committee after eight years, the organization said Wednesday in a statement. The decision comes while Team USA\u2019s governing body continues to face sharp questions over patterns of sexual abuse uncovered throughout the U.S. Olympic program.  USOC said the move was made out of consideration for Blackmun\u2019s health. He is currently being treated for prostate cancer.  Given Scott\u2019s current health situation, we have mutually agreed it is in the best interest of both Scott and the USOC that we identify new leadership so that we can immediately address the urgent initiatives ahead of us,  USOC Chairman Larry Probst said in a statement provided to HuffPost. Current board member Susanne Lyons will oversee day-to-day operations while a search is conducted for Blackmun\u2019s replacement. The group is continuing to evaluate what steps it can take to prevent abuse of its athletes and said it intends to form an advisory committee of abuse survivors and advocates.  Observers have been particularly critical of the USOC\u2019s relationship with former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar, who was handed a prison sentence of at least 40 years in January for serial sexual misconduct. In the wake of the scandal, Sens. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) and Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) called for Blackmun\u2019s resignation. Other Olympic groups, including USA Swimming, had also called for him and other USOC leaders to step down.  The USOC is at a critical point in its history,  Probst said.  The important work that Scott started needs to continue and will require especially vigorous attention in light of Larry Nassar\u2019s decades-long abuse of athletes affiliated with USA Gymnastics. We will be working with key stakeholders to help identify a permanent successor to Scott. In the meantime, I am confident that Susanne is the right person to help us navigate this critical transition period.  Blackmun had earned praise for his efforts to repair relations between the USOC and the International Olympic Committee.  Serving the USOC and its many stakeholders and working with our board, our professional staff and many others who support the Olympic and Paralympic movements has not only been immensely rewarding, it has been an honor and the highlight of my professional life,  Blackmun said in a statement. California attorney Robert Allard, who represents USA Swimming abuse survivors, said in a statement Wednesday that Blackmum\u2019s departure would be good for the USOC.  Scott Blackmun refused to protect athletes from predator coaches even though he knew for decades that sexual abuse was a major problem with USOC National Governing Bodies,  Allard said.  His legacy, along with USA Swimming CEO Chuck Wielgus, will be that of a sexual abuse enabler. Moving forward, the culture that allowed sexual abuse to fester and thrive under Blackmun must be destroyed. We will not rest until all of those that have been part of the childhood sexual abuse problem for decades are removed from the USOC and its National Governing Bodies. Only then will young athletes truly be safe. With Blackmun now gone, it is imperative that the USOC put someone in charge who places the safety and welfare of athletes as its top priority.  "

Papa John\u2019s CEO Steve Ritchie, who took over from founder John Schnatter on Jan. 1, told investors the company will shift its marketing from the whole NFL and instead focus on specific teams and players, according to Business Insider. In addition, Ritchie said, the company will emphasize digital sales and work toward changing the perception that its pizza is  too expensive.  Although Papa John\u2019s has been the official pizza of the NFL since 2010, the chain reported that North American sales dropped nearly 4 percent during the last three months of 2017 \u2015 which, if you need a reminder, was football season. Executives blamed the sales slump on  negative consumer sentiment.  And Schnatter may have been responsible for that. In November, he faced backlash after claiming that NFL players\u2019 kneeling protests were costing Papa John\u2019s money.  Schnatter put the blame on NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, saying the NFL hurt Papa John\u2019s shareholders  by not resolving the current debacle to the players\u2019 and owners\u2019 satisfaction.  Schnatter, who supported Donald Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign, told investors that Goodell should have stopped the players from exercising their right to free expression back in 2016. The player protests began when quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a knee in 2016 during the national anthem to protest racial injustice in America. Schnatter\u2019s remarks caused negative publicity for the company, and some NFL owners speculate Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who has a stake in more than 100 Papa John\u2019s locations, talked Schnatter into turning his attack on the league public, according to Pro Football Talk. As a result of poor sales, Schnatter stepped down as CEO at the beginning of the year, though he remains as chairman.  "

      "text": "Six months after acquiring Whole Foods, Amazon (AMZN) is working on reorganizing Whole Foods shelves by first adding Amazon private label products and, soon, it may add popular consumer packaged goods like Coca-Cola. Behind the scenes, this is causing internal debate and disagreements, Yahoo Finance has learned. When asked if Whole Foods will add  consumer packaged goods like Coca-Cola,  Whole Foods spokesperson Brooke Buchanan said,  As you know, we have really high-quality standards, and those products that you just mentioned don\u2019t meet those quality standards. If there were new products that actually do meet our quality standards, then there\u2019s always that consideration.  Amazon declined to comment. In June, Whole Foods CEO John Mackey called the marriage with Amazon,  love at first sight.  And the two appear to be in a happy union, with one big announcement after another: price cuts on staples; Amazon Echo devices debuting in stores; and recent free delivery on Whole Foods products for Prime members. But the honeymoon may be over as Amazon and Whole Foods butt heads over what to stock store shelves with. Would adding Coke sacrifice the healthy, organic image Whole Foods has long held dear? Whole Foods has been known for its strict rules on sourcing products, requiring foods  free of artificial preservatives, colors, flavors, sweeteners, and hydrogenated fats,  according to its website. That rules out Coca-Cola, the household product with artificial preservatives in the secret recipe, and even its healthier diet version. Amazon\u2019s plan to change Whole Foods\u2019 shelves is a key effort of the e-commerce giant\u2019s initiative to make Whole Foods profitable. Whole Foods same-store sales had been falling for eight consecutive quarters before being bought by Amazon. After Amazon\u2019s takeover, Whole Foods reported a 4.4% increase in sales for the quarter ending Sept. 24, 2017 from a year earlier \u2014 the biggest in two years. While Whole Foods gained an almost cult-like following, it has also been criticized for its limited store offerings, even as retailers like Walmart and Costco have started to sell more organic produce. Whole Foods owns just a 4% share in the total U.S. grocery market, a far cry from Walmart\u2019s 25% and Kroger\u2019s 10%, according to a Susquehanna analyst note last June. Then Amazon came. As a consumer-centric company, Amazon is leveraging Whole Foods to satisfy customer needs. That has become more urgent after Amazon provides free delivery of Whole Foods groceries for Prime members, who have a large appetite for packaged goods like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo snacks.  Whole Foods has proved a specialty retailer focusing only on organic food can\u2019t scale and be profitable,  says Brittain Ladd, a retail and supply chain consultant.  Amazon doesn\u2019t want to maintain the status quo. They can\u2019t see people go elsewhere simply because these highly-popular products are not available in Whole Foods.  Amazon could add private label products as soon as March, but the plan of bringing in consumer-packaged goods still faces obstacles from Whole Foods, according to sources familiar with the matter.  If that does ever happen, it will upset a lot of team members and customers,  a longtime Whole Foods store employee in Austin told Yahoo Finance.  That\u2019s what makes Whole Foods Market different from our competitors.  But food makers have already started providing healthy alternatives of its products for the Whole Foods. Last year, Bloomberg reported PepsiCo\u2019s Frito-Lay developed organic Doritos marketed under the name  Simply,  which meet all the criteria needed to be sold in Whole Foods. Industry experts said Whole Foods will eventually benefit from larger store selections, since many packaged goods have higher margins and a strong customer base.  It\u2019s painful, but Whole Foods needs to be put out of the comfort zone,  Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail told Yahoo Finance.  There are retailers that can provide high-quality organic food while offer packaged goods, and Amazon is helping Whole Foods in that direction.

And in a letter addressed to Mikhail Prokhorov, the billionaire businessman who is also the owner of the Brooklyn Nets basketball team, the lawyer for whistleblower Grigory Rodchenkov threatens a countersuit aimed at exposing the Russian government\u2019s efforts to harass and intimidate his client in the United States. The letter by lawyer Jim Walden, a copy of which was provided to Yahoo News, adds to the intrigue surrounding a lawsuit that was filed against Rodchenkov last week in a New York state court by three Russian biathletes who were stripped of their 2014 Olympic medals as a result of the whistleblower\u2019s allegations about Russian doping. The lawsuit accuses Rodchenkov, the former director of Russia\u2019s antidoping laboratory, of defaming the biathletes and  destroying their careers.  Letter To Mikhail Prokhorov Scott Balber, the New York lawyer for the Russian athletes, has acknowledged that Prokhorov is helping to finance the lawsuit along with unnamed others.  I am not at liberty to identify anyone else other than Mr. Prokhorov,  Balber said in an email Monday, when asked who else was bankrolling the lawsuit. Balber once represented Donald Trump in a $5 million lawsuit \u2014 filed in 2013 and later withdrawn \u2014 against comedian Bill Maher for likening Trump\u2019s hair to an orangutan\u2019s. He currently represents another Russian oligarch, Aras Agalarov, and his son Emin Agalarov \u2014 two key figures in the Trump-Russia investigation who helped arrange the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russian operatives at which Trump campaign officials were promised derogatory information about Hillary Clinton.  Mr. Balber\u2019s admission that unnamed \u2018others\u2019 are also financing this lawsuit is strange \u2014 raising the specter that the Kremlin itself might be acting through proxies here,  Walden said in a statement to Yahoo News.  Certainly, this could be problematic for all involved in this shady suit.  In his letter to Prokhorov, Walden asks that all documents relating to the litigation be preserved, including any communications between the Brooklyn Nets owner and  any current or former Russian government officials, Russian law enforcement officers, officers or agents of the FSB [Russia\u2019s domestic intelligence service] or representatives of the Russian Olympic Committee.  Asked for comment, Balber called Walden\u2019s letter  a publicity stunt  and said,  As far as I know, there is absolutely no Russian government role in the filing of the lawsuit. This appears to be complete fiction.  He added:  The sole purpose of this lawsuit is to clear the names of three hard-working, world-class Olympic athletes, and to obtain compensation for the economic loss they have suffered as a result of Mr. Rodchenkov\u2019s false and defamatory statements.  The legal sparring is the latest development in a complicated political and sporting saga that has been playing out since Rodchenkov fled Russia and went public with his account in 2016, describing what he portrayed as a vast and sophisticated scheme by Russia to provide banned drugs to the country\u2019s athletes to boost their performance in the Olympic Games and other international sporting competitions \u2014 and to cheat the systems meant to catch them. In numerous interviews and in the widely acclaimed Netflix documentary  Icarus,  Rodchenkov described how he worked with the FSB, the Russian spy agency formerly headed by Putin, and with Russia\u2019s sports ministry to oversee a system in which sealed urine samples of athletes were routinely swapped after testing, allowing athletes to take banned substances to avoid detection. After the Sochi Olympics, Rodchenkov was awarded a prestigious Order of Friendship medal by Putin. The allegations by Rodchenkov were confirmed by international investigators and led to the International Olympic Committee\u2019s decision to bar Russia from sending a delegation to this year\u2019s Winter Olympics in South Korea, although Russian athletes were allowed to participate as individuals. That decision was reaffirmed just this week by the Olympic Committee, which refused to let Russian athletes march under their own flag in the closing ceremony at the South Korea Olympics. Since fleeing to the United States, Rodchenkov, now in the federal witness protection program, has provided key evidence to international investigators and Justice Department officials about potential violations of federal law by the Russians. In doing so, he has become virtually public enemy No. 1 to Putin\u2019s government: Prosecutors in Russia have filed criminal charges against him, accusing him of drug trafficking, and Putin during his end of the year press conference last December suggested that Rodchenkov was being drugged and manipulated by U.S. intelligence agencies.  What are [U.S. intelligence agencies] doing with him there?  Putin said at the December press conference.  Are they giving him some kind of substances so that he says what\u2019s required?  Shortly after Putin\u2019s comments, Walden said he was warned by U.S. officials that Russian agents may be looking for Rodchenkov in the United States. Walden, a former federal prosecutor, said he is concerned that the lawsuit is in fact in furtherance of that effort \u2014 an attempt  to find him through judicial means.

Three days later, she tested positive for a banned substance at the Pyeongchang Winter Games. Sergeeva denied taking the drug that triggered the positive result. The video showing Sergeeva wearing a sweatshirt emblazoned with the words,  I don\u2019t do doping. I am ZASPORT,  a reference to the official clothing supplier to the Russian Olympic Committee, has since been deleted from Instagram, according to The Guardian. The clip was reportedly posted to Instagram on Feb. 15 by Russia-based videographer Roman Bibishev. ABC News said the video was produced last year to promote the clothing brand. Sergeeva was spotted in a similar shirt in Pyeongchang earlier this month. The Associated Press said she wore a white T-shirt with the words  I Don\u2019t Do Doping  under her racing suit during a training session. Sergeeva \u2014 who finished 12th in the two-woman bobsleigh event in Pyeongchang \u2014 tested positive for an angina medication with performance-enhancing properties on Feb. 18, the Russian bobsleigh federation announced on its Facebook page. She passed a drug test five days earlier. Sergeeva denied taking the drug. The federation\u2019s president, Alexander Zubkov, said the athlete had not been prescribed any medication. Sergeeva was the second Russian athlete to fail a doping test at the Pyeongchang Games. Alexander Krushelnitsky, an Olympic curler, was forced to return his bronze medal last week after testing positive for meldonium, a potential performance-enhancing drug.  The International Olympic Committee banned Russia from the 2018 Winter Games over its state-backed doping program, but allowed a group of athletes to compete under the Olympic flag.  The IOC said it considered lifting the suspension for Sunday\u2019s closing ceremony so OAR athletes could march under the Russian flag. In the end, however, the committee decided to keep the ban in place because of the two failed drug tests.  "

Team USA won a total of 23 medals in Pyeongchang, South Korea \u2015 nine gold, eight silver and six bronze medals among them. Twelve of the 23 medals were won by women \u2015 not including two that were achieved in mixed events (ice dancing and the team figure skating competition). When it came to the gold medals, five of the nine were won by women in history-making performances. Cross-country skiers Kikkan Randall and Jessica Diggins won gold in the sprint freestyle, winning a medal in the event for Team USA for the first time since 1976 (and its first gold, to boot). Seventeen-year-old snowboarding sensation Chloe Kim won gold in the halfpipe, becoming the youngest ever gold medalist in the history of the event. The women\u2019s hockey team won gold in the finals, beating longtime rival Canada and giving the team its first Olympic gold since the event debuted at the Winter Games in 1998.  Even when the women didn\u2019t win gold, they still made history. Women athletes won three of six silver medals and four of six bronze medals. Alpine skier Lindsey Vonn took bronze in the downhill event to become the oldest Olympic female alpine medalist at the age of 33. Team USA\u2019s female athletes also surpassed their male teammates in medal count. As the Washington Post noted, only alpine skier Mikaela Shiffrin, snowboarder Jamie Anderson and ice dancing siblings Alex and Maia Shibutani won two medals at the games. There were more men on Team USA, too. A total of 244 athletes made up America\u2019s delegation \u2015 the largest U.S. delegation in Winter Olympics history. There were 135 men and 109 women. After the Associated Press obtained a medal tally projection chart created by the United States Olympic Committee (USOC), it became clear that Team USA did not meet the organization\u2019s expectations for awarded medals in Peyongchang. USOC projected Team USA would bring home a target of 37 medals, setting a minimum of 25 medals and a top-line expectation of 59. Team USA came in fourth in overall medal count. Norway took the lead, bringing home 39 medals, followed by Germany at 31 and Canada at 29. "

A group of skaters and sweepers gathered for a selfie on the ice on Saturday after the Olympic figure skating exhibition gala, an event where athletes are given an opportunity to express themselves. Hanyu definitely showed his own flair in the photo, striking a pose in the air after being hoisted up by pair skater Ond\u0159ej Hot\u00e1rek of Italy.  The result is a thing of beauty.  Naturally, people freaked out across social media at the extremely extra pose. Many praised fan favorite Hanyu for always bringing the fire, as well as Hot\u00e1rek for being a true friend during selfie time.  And the selfie, taken by skater Misha Ge of Uzbekistan, really did turn out to be a masterpiece.  Hanyu, who has a fierce fanbase, has been known to charm hearts everywhere with his quirky personality and selflessness. After winning gold in the men\u2019s singles competition, Hanyu ushered fellow Japanese skater Shoma Uno, the silver medalist, and Spain\u2019s Javier Fernandez, the bronze medalist, onto his podium. The moment prompted praise from social media users who admired Hanyu\u2019s good sportsmanship. Hanyu is also loved for his own appreciation of lovable bear Winnie-The-Pooh. Back in 2010, the Olympian began to carry around a Winnie-The-Pooh tissue box and also ensured that a plushie would be placed on the side of rink that would  watch  him skate. Fans soon began to catch on to his love of the bear. Fans toss him stuffed Poohs after he finishes his routines, as was widely seen at the Winter Games this year in Pyeongchang, South Korea. The skater typically donates the bears to the area\u2019s children, because that\u2019s the kinda guy he is.   Add all that with killer moves on the ice and incredible selfie skills and we have to ask ourselves, what\u2019s not to love about Hanyu?    "

      "text": "PYEONGCHANG, South Korea (Reuters) - The International Olympic Committee (IOC) dashed Russian athletes\u2019 hopes of marching behind their national flag at the Winter Games on Sunday, deciding against immediately lifting Russia\u2019s Olympic suspension after fresh doping violations. Russians have been competing as neutral athletes at the Games, their Olympic status suspended, as IOC punishment for years of drug scandals involving allegations that Russia ran a systematic, state-backed drug-cheating program. The IOC said two Russian doping violations during the Pyeongchang Games had marred an otherwise clean report card for the Russian delegation at the Games.  This was hugely disappointing and, in addition to other considerations, prevented the IOC from even considering lifting the suspension for the closing ceremony,  IOC President Thomas Bach said in presenting the recommendation to IOC members. Bach said Russia\u2019s Olympic status would be restored automatically once it was confirmed there were no other doping violations by Russian athletes at Pyeongchang. It does not require any further decision by the IOC.  That is an automatic decision,  he told reporters.  This is an objective condition ... and then the sanction is lifted.  The suspended Russian Olympic Committee (ROC) said it hoped to return to the Olympic family in the coming days.  We hope and really count on that in the next few days, the membership of the Russian Olympic Committee in the IOC will be completely restored,  it said in a statement.  In light of the situation, we consider that the restoration of the rights of the ROC and all Russian athletes will be the main result of the Olympic Games that are ending today.  Competition at the Winter Games concludes on Sunday and final drug testing results might not be known for several days or even weeks.  I\u2019m very disappointed,  said Elena Valbe, president of the Russian cross-country skiing federation.  Some athletes stayed behind later with the hope that they would be walking under the Russian flag. I\u2019ve heard athletes say that they were staying just because they wanted to walk with the flag and in our uniform.  Former Olympic ice hockey champion Igor Larionov told Reuters it would be hard for Russian players to stand on the podium under the Olympic flag if they won the ice hockey gold medal in their final against Germany later on Sunday.  Time needs to pass for the right to have the flag back, I think,  the Russian said.  It is difficult for me to understand how any figure skater, hockey player or skier can win gold and stand on the podium without their flag. It\u2019s sad. \u2018DROWNING MAN\u2019 Russia\u2019s Olympic delegation chief and its figure skating silver medalist, Evgenia Medvedeva, had made a last appeal to the IOC on Saturday for their suspension to be lifted, apologizing for the two doping violations during the Games. Medal-winning curler Alexander Krushelnitsky and bobsledder Nadezhda Sergeeva failed doping tests, angering a team that had been through extensive testing before and during the first days of Games competition without returning any positive results. The lawyer for Grigory Rodchenkov, the former Russian doping laboratory director who turned whistleblower and helped expose the drugs scandal, said  cooler heads  at the IOC had prevailed and stopped Russia\u2019s immediate Olympic return. Rodchenkov currently lives in hiding in the United States.  Thomas Bach was a drowning man, but finally cooler heads within the IOC threw him a life preserver,  Jim Walden said in a statement.  Yet, in the decision, the IOC had the gall to claim Russia \u2018respected\u2019 its decision on December 5th to institute the suspension. The acrimony caused by Bach\u2019s mismanagement should be his undoing,  Walden said. At the Games, the Russians have been unable to wear national uniforms or have their anthem played at medal presentations. Russian delegation chief Stanislav Pozdnyakov has said that the prospect of flying the flag at Sunday night\u2019s closing ceremony meant more to his athletes than winning medals. In December, the IOC had held out the prospect of lifting Russia\u2019s suspension for the closing ceremony, on the condition its athletes met a strict code of conduct, including compliance with anti-doping rules and observance of athlete neutrality.

Russia, competing as neutral athletes at Pyeongchang, scored in overtime through Kirill Kaprizov for a 4-3 victory in one of the most surprising finals in the history of the Olympic men\u2019s ice hockey tournament. Later, at the medal ceremony, the winning team sang the Russian anthem over the sound of the Olympic anthem at the hockey arena, despite being barred by Olympic authorities from having their flag raised or anthem played. With Germany\u2019s Patrick Reimer off for high sticking midway through the extra period, the Olympic Athletes from Russia went on a four-on-three man advantage and Kaprizov one-timed a pass from Nikita Gusev past German goaltender Danny aus den Birken. The OAR found themselves evenly matched by a German team that had surprised the hockey world by making it to their first Olympic final. The Germans won silver, their best finish ever in Olympic ice hockey. Both teams scored twice in a back-and-forth third period with Nikita Gusev knotting the game with a short-handed goal with less than a minute to go to force the overtime period. The Russians hit the ice hours after the International Olympic Committee (IOC) decided not to restore their delegation\u2019s Olympic status, which would have enabled them to march under their flag at the closing ceremony later on Sunday. [nL4N1QF015] As the OAR players received their gold medals on the ice, the Olympic flag was raised in place of the Russian flag and the Olympic anthem was played. But the players, arms around each other, sang the Russian anthem instead. Singing the Russian anthem on the field of play is a violation of the IOC\u2019s rules on neutrality, which were imposed on Russia as part of sanctions punishing the nation over systematic doping across many sports. On paper the final shouldn\u2019t have been a fair fight but the Germans skated evenly with the OAR. Loaded with top home-grown talent from Russia\u2019s Kontinental Hockey League, seen as the world\u2019s second-best league after the NHL, and led by ex-NHL all stars Pavel Datsyuk and Ilya Kovalchuk, the OAR finally edged past a team that had punched above its weight. Aside from Kaprizov with the game winner, Gusev was the other hero for the OAR, scoring two third-period goals and getting an assist to become the tournament\u2019s points leader.

South Korean Kim Bo-reum slipped into the channel created by Takagi to win the silver medal 0.12 seconds behind the Japanese as Schouten settled for bronze. Takagi, who won gold in the women\u2019s team pursuit earlier this week, now has an individual Olympic title to add to her collection.  The 25-year-old celebrated by pumping her fists and waving to the crowd before making a lap of the stadium with the Japanese flag fluttering above her head.  I\u2018m feeling very good,  Takagi told reporters.  Only lost focus on two laps, then I showed good acceleration. Then with 100 meters \u2013- go. I\u2018m very happy. I focus on team pursuit and mass start.   The race made its Olympic debut in South Korea and was given a touch of celebrity by the presence of Ivanka Trump, daughter of the U.S. President. It was a tactical encounter, with 16 skaters simultaneously vying for an advantage on the track. None of the trio who finished on the podium tried to win any of the three intermediate sprints, preferring instead to stay well back in the peloton and save their legs for the final push for a medal. The first three to finish the race earn 60, 40 and 20 points respectively, while the top three skaters in each of the intermediate sprints earn five, three and one points to decide the classification places. With two laps to go in the 16-lap race, the pack began to pick up speed, rapidly reeling in early pace-setter Saskia Alusalu of Estonia, who finished in fourth place after winning all three intermediate sprints. Schouten had the lead going into the final corner but the Dutch skater misjudged her line slightly and was forced wide coming out, and Takagi stormed up the inside channel to capitalize on the mistake. She crossed the line in a flurry of effort, her arms and legs pumping furiously to hold off Kim by a narrow margin. Kim was crestfallen after finishing second. She made a deep bow to the crowd and took a lap around the track waving her country\u2019s flag.

The LA Times reports police took Martin into custody for questioning Friday. Harvard-Westlake School informed students it was closing  out of an abundance of caution  in an email Friday morning, adding,  we believe there is no imminent threat to our campuses or our school community.   Martin, a graduate of the high school, shared a photo of a shotgun and a handful of shells on his Instagram story Friday morning, along with the caption,  When you\u2019re a bully victim and a coward, your options are suicide or revenge.  Martin tagged four people, including his former Dolphins teammates Richie Incognito and Mike Pouncey in the post, referencing both the high school and the Dolphins in text overlaying the image of the shotgun. In 2013, Martin accused Incognito and Pouncey of aggressively bullying other players in the Dolphins locker room.

      "text": "Documents and bank records obtained in discovery during the federal investigation into the underbelly of college basketball detail in meticulous fashion the expenditures of prominent former NBA agent Andy Miller, his former associate Christian Dawkins and his agency, ASM Sports. They include expense reports and balance sheets that list cash advances, as well as entertainment and travel expenses for high school and college prospects and their families. Yahoo Sports viewed hundreds of pages of documents from the years-long probe that had federal authorities monitoring multiple targets and intercepting more than 4,000 calls across 330 days, providing a clear-eyed view into the pervasive nature of the game\u2019s underground economy. While three criminal cases tied to the investigation may take years to play out, the documents viewed by Yahoo revealed the extent of the potential NCAA ramifications from the case. The documents show an underground recruiting operation that could create NCAA rules issues \u2013 both current and retroactive \u2013 for at least 20 Division I basketball programs and more than 25 players. The documents tie some of the biggest names and programs in the sport to activity that appears to violate the NCAA\u2019s amateurism rules. This could end up casting a pall over the NCAA tournament because of eligibility issues. (NCAA officials declined a request for comment.) There\u2019s potential impermissible benefits and preferential treatment for players and families of players at Duke, North Carolina, Texas, Kentucky, Michigan State, USC, Alabama and a host of other schools. The documents link some of the sport\u2019s biggest current stars \u2013 Michigan State\u2019s Miles Bridges, Alabama\u2019s Collin Sexton and Duke\u2019s Wendell Carter \u2013 to specific potential extra benefits for either the athletes or their family members. The amounts tied to players in the case range from basic meals to tens of thousands of dollars. An ASM balance sheet in the hands of federal investigators shows accounts through Dec. 31, 2015, with the subheading,  Loan to Players.  It listed several who were in high school or college as receiving four-figure and five-figure payments from ASM Sports. Among the largest listed loans: Yahoo Sports reached out to officials at N.C. State, Seton Hall, Maryland, Kentucky and Washington. They all declined comment or did not return correspondence. In addition, Dawkins filed expense reports seeking reimbursement for thousands of dollars that he reported as being paid to college and high school players and their families. Several players, families of players or handlers received more than $1,000 in payments from ASM Sports before turning professional: Among those receiving hundreds of dollars in advances, according to Dawkins\u2019 expense reports: Additional Dawkins expense reports list meals and meetings with players or their families while in college or high school, and before they turned pro. While small amounts, these could be categorized as extra benefits under NCAA rules. It appears Dawkins paid for the meals, which could be an important distinction.  There\u2019s nothing wrong with meeting with an agent,  said Atlanta-based lawyer Stu Brown, a veteran of representing schools and coaches in NCAA compliance cases.  But then it becomes a question of who pays for the meal.  Among the players and/or families who are listed as meeting with or having meals with Dawkins: The breadth of names, schools and current players could offer a vexing test for both university compliance offices and the NCAA\u2019s enforcement division. The sheer number of potential cases and varying degrees of potential violations are vast. There\u2019s also an overriding factor of the ongoing criminal investigations. A complicating facet to it will be the NCAA\u2019s potential inability to view key documents related to this case, because those details not in the criminal complaints are sealed under protective order. In terms of eligibility, the NCAA and the institution may be prohibited from interviewing people associated with the case because of the parallel criminal cases. (The initial onus to decide is almost always on the school in an eligibility case.) No one is certain how the NCAA enforcement office would potentially handle the cases. The NCAA has been in constant contact with the feds but so far has had minimal direct involvement with the case, as they\u2019ve been careful to respect the boundaries of the criminal investigations. The likely scenario, according to Brown, would be for the schools to assess the credibility of what\u2019s in the documents and the severity of the potential violations.  There\u2019s potential for chaos, as it depends on the number of cases and the amount of information that\u2019s released,  Brown said.  There could be inconsistency as a subset of chaos, as different schools may very validly assess the credibility of [the cases] differently.  Yahoo did not view all of the documents in the three criminal cases tied to the investigation, but the records show an uncommon amount of detail for activities that have come under federal scrutiny. For example, the expense reports have hundreds of lines like: Feb. 10, 2016:  Flight for Brian Bowen mom. Flight for Brian Bowen. Flight for Brian Bowen dad.  They totaled more than $1,500. Feb. 1, 2016:  Advance to Apples Jones (Josh Jackson) $1,700.  Jan. 13, 2016:  ATM withdrawl: Advance to Fred Van Vleet $483.  May 3, 2016:  Redwood Lodge. Lunch w/Miles Bridges Parents. $70.05.  May 3, 2016:  ATM Withdrawl: Miles Bridges mom advance. $400  According to the documents, Dawkins has dinners listed with plenty of boldface names in the sport \u2013 Tom Izzo,  Villanova coaches,  Fultz and the family of wayward five-star prospect Mitchell Robinson. Along the way, a portrait emerges of the inner-workings of the office of Miller, who relinquished his NBA Players Association agent certification in the wake of the probe. Miller has yet to be charged in the case, and it\u2019s widely believed he\u2019s cooperating with the government. Dawkins\u2019 lawyer, Steve Haney, told Yahoo Sports earlier in the week it was  utter hypocrisy  that an underling like Dawkins and the four assistant coaches were charged in the case and their superiors have gone unscathed. Haney added on Thursday night in an email statement:  These are college eligibility issues and agent licensing issues, not matters of national security that deserve this level of FBI involvement and taxpayer resources\u2026..it has reached a degree of being ridiculous.  Dawkins, the 24-year-old former business associate, was arrested on Sept. 26 and faces felony charges of wire fraud and bribery in two of the three criminal cases tied to the investigation. He ended up on federal wiretaps and, soon after the case broke in late September, his rise became a cautionary tale for how vulnerable top coaches and programs are to the agent world. Yahoo Sports reached out to a dozen programs tied to the documents late Thursday. Only Xavier coach Chris Mack elected to release a statement. He said:  I have no relationship with Andy Miller or any of his associates. He plays no role in the recruitment of potential student athletes on Xavier\u2019s behalf. Beyond that, our staff has never created a path for him to foster a relationship with any of our student-athletes while enrolled at Xavier. Any suggestion that I or anyone on my staff utilized Andy Miller to provide even the slightest of financial benefits to a Xavier student-athlete is grossly misinformed. We are prepared to cooperate with any and all investigations at any level.  With an ongoing investigation, the chance looms there could be more charges and arrests. So far, four former assistant college basketball coaches have been arrested: Tony Bland of USC, Chuck Person of Auburn, Emanuel Richardson of Arizona and Lamont Evans of Oklahoma State. Six other assorted participants in the basketball underworld also have been arrested: Dawkins; former sneaker executives James Gatto and Merl Code; financial adviser Munish Sood; clothier and former referee Rashan Michel; and Florida AAU coach Brad Augustine. Charges against Augustine earlier were dismissed without explanation. The case has also cost Louisville coach Rick Pitino his job, as the school parted ways with the Hall of Famer soon after the details of the program\u2019s involvement in a six-figure agreement to sign five-star recruit Brian Bowen went public. Louisville athletic director Tom Jurich also was dismissed. At Auburn, two players and two members of the basketball support staff have been suspended. USC is withholding star point guard De\u2019Anthony Melton from competition this season as well.

      "text": "Beauty Tip # 1: How to get makeup to last all day  Have you ever had one of those frustrating moments at the end of a long day when you look in the mirror and suddenly realize that your makeup has virtually melted off? Well, those days are long gone! Short of stashing makeup products in your purse, here are a few beauty tips that help your makeup last from morning until night (without touch-ups). Before putting on face makeup, start by applying a small amount of skin-perfecting makeup primer all over your face (including your eyelids). This will not only help minimize the look of pores and fine lines, it will also give your face makeup something to adhere to, which helps boost your makeup's staying power. Instead of using a traditional face powder (which can make your skin look cakey, dry, and aged), opt for a translucent setting powder. This will not only help keep your face makeup on throughout a long day, it will also add a slightly matte effect (especially to skin's oilier areas, like your T-Zone). As a finishing touch, use a makeup setting spray to significantly increase your makeup's longevity. Beauty Tip # 2: How to get thicker, longer eyelashes  Wouldn't you love the look of thicker, longer eyelashes (without having to glue on those cumbersome false eyelash strips)? Well, you're in luck! The beauty industry recently started producing several new eye makeup products that are not only easy to use, they also don't require the precision and expertise of a makeup artist to apply. As an alternative to using falsies, opt for a lash-thickening mascara system. These products help build-up the look of your individual eyelashes via the application of flexible cotton or nylon fibers. When the mascara is applied to your lashes, it grabs onto each nylon fiber (which act like a thickening lash primer), instantly making your eyelashes look longer and fuller. Beauty Tip # 3: How to make your eyes look bigger  To make your eyes look bigger (and more awake), always start by curling your eyelashes. This immediately makes your eyes appear larger, and also creates the illusion that your eyelashes are longer. Starting at the base of your eyelashes, gently curl them using an eyelash curler. Lightly clamp down on your lashes mid-way, and then finally at the tips. This three-curl motion helps to create a natural curved effect to your lashes. In addition, never completely rim your eyes with eyeliner. This technique actually has the opposite effect, as it makes your eyes look smaller. Instead, (using a waterproof eyeliner) only line your upper lash line with eyeliner and draw a line half-way in (from the outer corner) on your lower lash line. You can slightly smudge the eyeliner for a softer, less dramatic effect. Beauty Tip # 4: How to make your lips look fuller Without having to resort to lip injections and fillers, you can quickly create the illusion of fuller lips with these easy-to-follow beauty tips. Start with a lip-plumping product before applying any lip color. This topical solution temporarily gives your pout a fuller, more supple look. By using collagen-infused formulations, these products help keep your lips hydrated too. Lighter lip colors (like pale pink and nude) help make your lips look fuller; whereas, darker colors (like wine and deep reds) can actually make your lips look thinner. As a finishing touch, apply a small amount of lip gloss to the center of your lips. This reflective effect makes your pout look plumper and sexier. Beauty Tip # 5: How to make your face look thinner The art of makeup contouring and highlighting has been a well-known beauty secret that models and actresses have used for years. To act as a highlighter, apply concealer to your face in the following areas: in an upside-down triangle shape underneath your eyes, along the bridge of your nose, and above the cupid's bow of your mouth. After applying concealer and foundation, using a matte bronzer or contouring powder (about two shades darker than your foundation color), sweep this darker color across the hollows of your cheeks (it helps to suck-in your cheeks while doing this). Then sweep the bronzer below your jawline, under your chin, and along the perimeter of your forehead. As a final touch, sweep blush onto the apples of your cheeks. This highlighting and contouring technique helps accentuate your cheekbones, while making your face appear thinner and more sculpted. So there you have it -- five fabulous beauty tips that will instantly make you look flawless and gorgeous every day, from morning until night!

      "text": "Millennials -- the so-called \"spoiled\" generation, born with silver spoons rather than pacifiers -- aren't as foolish with tax refund money as you probably suspect. While it's tempting to picture Gen-Y-ers jumping on the next flight to Vegas and partying with that extra few thousand returned from the government, shockingly, they're not. Millennials don't cave to impulse spending as easily as you may think, naturally hindering splurging with an inherent desire for more, and this year are actually investing tax refund money. But, of course, this investing is in an \"alternative\" fashion.  From an insider perspective, I'll admit, initially it's hard to not splurge the money. You're young, you're likely single without dependents, so carefree is your middle name. And you basically get this free (although, yes, I realize it's technically already my money) lump sum of cash deposited into your checking account, amounts of which averaged around $3,000 this year.  With an extra few thousand sitting in my account, of course I wanted take an expensive stroll down Broadway in Soho. Or take a trip. Or buy every other health and beauty loot deal on Lifebooker. Or simply go a month without checking my bank account every Tuesday morning with a knot in my stomach. But, low and behold, I restrained myself, and so do most Millennials. The Millennial Shopper is the Mass Maximizer The consumer characteristic outsiders overlook about Millennials, is that when it comes to spending, we are a generation of maximizers, and it's both a blessing and a curse. Sure, we can identify what we like, online, on our phones and in store, but liking a product simply isn't enough to make us buy it.  First of all, we want the very best deal on it. And some type of gamification incentive that makes the purchase feel rewarding. And the fastest delivery option. And free shipping -- of course. And, while we're at it (and since we're alpha-influencers), the option to customize it. And eventually we think, \"But, wait, now that an hour has passed, do I really want this in the first place? Maybe there's something better out there... \" It takes so long to find all the aspects of an item we want, that by the time we do, we'll often just forfeit the need to buy it at all -- yes, the epitome of counterproductive.  Millennial Entitlement is a Splurge-Deterrent The dreaded entitlement Millennials feel, which usually manifests as arrogance, or superiority without merit, is actually an inherent splurge-deterrent. Like the dieter with a sweet tooth who spends 20 minutes picking a flavor before indulging in a chocolate at which time, right before, the urge suddenly passes, often by the time Millennials finally find an item and place to buy that meets all the purchase aspects that we feel we deserve, either the craving for the item has passed or our attention spans are just spent.  The never-satisfied, non-spending trend has even spanned to online commerce, where many Millennials treat online shopping the same way showroomers typically treat in-store shopping: continually on the hunt for the \"better\" product, price, incentive, what have you. This extensive, somewhat dysfunctional cycle of a typical Millennial consumer has paved the way for unprecedented, visibly soaring rates of digital native advertising and explains why lucrative brands are becoming products in and of themselves.  Here's How Millennials Really \"Invest\" Tax Refunds Nowadays, instead of splurging, most Millennials, 67 percent in fact, are saving or investing tax refund money. Saving is one thing, but \"investing\" in a loose term. Again acting as mass maximizers, Millennials strive to find somewhat unconventional outlets and methods to \"invest\" tax money and most are investments in themselves: Goodbye life insurance; Millennials invest in health.   Is there such a thing as being too proactive? Millennials may put off the future, but we're opting for a health-conscious lifestyle right now. Instead of contributing to a \"death\" fund, Millennials are opting to invest in tech to live longer, healthier lives.  Goodbye IRA; Millennials invest in retiring at the end of each day.  Rather than wait until 65 to sit back and spend, Millennials are investing in the things that help them relax each day. As a generation who grew up with robots before computers, automation is hip right now in the millennial world, and so are automated products that do the work for you, such as iRobot Vacuums.  Goodbye financial advisor; Millennials invest in personal accountability.   It's not all instant gratification, we also think about our future. Millennials are investing in a new type of money management with online, cloud-based personal finance software. Goodbye insurance policy; Millennials cover themselves in different ways.  Different and digital ways, that is. Wearable tech is the hot new commodity hardworking Millennials can't get enough of. It's not just FitBits; it's straight-from-the-trade-show-debuted wearable technologies that actually provide some useful benefits.  Goodbye savings account; Millennials invest in saving more now.   Why spend more money than need be? As opposed to saving money for an unpredictable future, Millennials are going green and choosing to invest in gadgets that help them save more money now. Plus, energy-saving is trendy, so we're willing to pay more for \"smart\" lightbulbs and nest thermostats.  Goodbye home improvements; Millennials invest in heart improvements.   (Image source: AskMen) After all, we've all heard growing up that home is where the heart is. Millennials may be unfamiliar with courtship and phone dates, but we still think love is worth investing in. (And unlike other generations, it's perfectly acceptable to go the online dating route to find it.) Goodbye charitable donations; Millennials invest in giving a better version of themselves to the world.   We were taught we must help ourselves before helping others, so this shouldn't come as any surprise. Millennials invest in improving who they are first and foremost before taking on external challenges, and there's plenty of tech out there, such as the Lumo Lift, to help us do just that. "

      "text": "Over the past few months, I've read several essays linking makeup and professionalism. Written by stylish women working in corporate America, these articles insist that daily makeup application is a must for working women, and that going without it may degrade your image of competence and reliability. They inevitably cite a recent study, the results of which indicate that women wearing just the right amount of makeup appear more trustworthy and likable to most observers. And they send readers scrambling to Sephora to upgrade their stashes.  I never experimented with makeup as a girl and didn't even learn to pluck my eyebrows until I was 30. The older I get, the more I find myself relying on cosmetics to define and conceal, shape and highlight my features. And although I'd rather spend my precious minutes reading or sleeping or kissing my husband, I don't actively resent my ever-expanding makeup application routine. I do, however, resent the implication that a woman without makeup doesn't belong in the workplace, or that applying makeup is essential to career success. And here's why: Laws versus policing I encourage my readers and clients to select clothing that fits their figures and broadcasts their confidence and self-respect. I believe that dressing is a social contract and that understanding the norms surrounding appropriate dressing choice for various life situations will ease human relationships. But I am also aware that there are laws about clothing. Actual laws that apply to both men and women. To go about in public and not be fined or arrested, humans must be clothed. And in my opinion, since we've got to get dressed anyway, we might as well do it expressively and in ways that feel good. Since dressing is social, we can also make style choices that will make us appear polished, impressive, and self-aware. So, in my view, acquiring an understanding of how to dress is both beneficial and required. There are no laws about wearing makeup. Makeup is entirely optional everywhere. Although some men wear makeup, the majority of makeup consumers and wearers are women. And to tell these women that they should feel obliged to apply makeup on a daily basis in order to garner the respect and admiration of their colleagues is to police their behaviors based solely on social norms. To say that makeup is essential to workplace achievement is to promote the belief that the performance of traditional femininity is the only route to professional success for women. To insist on a set of grooming-related behaviors that doesn't remove dirt or odor, doesn't make something that is naturally messy look neater, and really only serves to \"enhance\" or \"amplify\" certain facial features is to remind women that their physical selves are never going to be acceptable in their natural state. I understand that there are plenty of voluntary behaviors that human beings engage to further their personal goals, plenty of things we do because they're beneficial though not required. And yet this case is so focused on forcing women to be and look one specific way, I can't help but feel it is more about reinforcing existing social norms than it is about ensuring the professional success of women as a group. The fine line But what about that study, you ask? Well, first off, it was funded by Procter & Gamble, a company that manufactures and sells makeup and was undoubtedly thrilled to see results linking makeup and trustworthiness. But perhaps more importantly, the results emphasized that while barefaced is too little, \"glamorous\" is too much. If you apply just the right amount of eyeshadow and blush, you appear more capable, reliable and amiable. But overdo it and \"there may be a lowering of trust.\" So not only are you being asked to spend money on cosmetics and spend your time and energy applying them, you must be very careful not to apply too little or too much or you risk ruining everything. Without makeup, you're unprofessional, inexperienced, a hippie or a child or a socially oblivious loser. With too much makeup you're unprofessional in an entirely different way, still socially oblivious but more on the sexualized diva end of the spectrum. There are parallels to dressing, here, of course: Women are expected to dress in ways that aren't too dowdy or too slutty. Fall too far on either side and you risk ridicule and censure by the lady-policing machinery built into modern society. This is nothing you'll ever hear me defending. But again, wearing clothing is required by law and since you've got to get dressed anyway, choosing to align your lawfully required garments with social expectations may work to your benefit. Makeup is optional. And if you aren't naturally interested in it and you ARE going to be judged negatively should you fail to apply the exact right amount of it, why bother at all? Focus on accomplishment I give presentations on professional dress and grooming to college seniors and women's leadership programs, so you'll never hear me say that how you present your physical self in professional situations is irrelevant. But here's a tidbit that goes into every single lecture I deliver: Comportment, demeanor, dress, grooming, and overall appearance constitute the first levels of information about ourselves that we offer to the observing world. They may not be the most important, but they are the first, which makes them worthy of effort and attention. What I hope to convey to my audience members is that blending personal style and comfort preferences with environmental expectations can help you create looks that feel great and allow you to forget all about what you look like so you can focus on your message, your work, your passion. I also remind them that badly applied makeup is generally considered to be worse than no makeup at all, and that it's completely fine to skip it. I want them to feel confident and empowered, and I want them to think more about their goals than their shoes. By telling women that a perfectly applied face of makeup is a prerequisite for career success, we are telling them that how they look is more important than what they know or what they have achieved. We are telling them that their natural faces will distract people, that being pretty is necessary regardless of circumstance, that performing femininity in exactly the right way isn't just helpful, it's essential. Insisting that makeup become integral to a professional woman's daily life subtly tells her that if she doesn't look right it won't matter how smart or creative or innovative or capable she is. And that is patently untrue. Since I've admitted to being a makeup novice myself, I realize I may sound defensive. And maybe I am. When I read this spate of makeup-career articles, the underlying message I got was, \"If you don't wear makeup, you don't look like a grownup to other grownups.\" And that sentiment makes me want to break things. Some adult women wear makeup and others don't. Learning to apply makeup is a rite of passage for many, but it is not a skill set required for acceptance into the Grown-Ass Woman Club. Any more than having children or going to college or losing your virginity or working outside the home or any of the other arbitrary markers of so-called \"real\" womanhood are. Being a woman can be done in infinite ways, and forging a successful career path can play out in infinite ways. Accomplished, professional, grown women can take on the world at any age, at any stage, and in any way they see fit. And they can do it with or without lipstick and foundation. "

That's where Regina Livers, a fashion marketing manager, comes in.  We spotted Livers in New York City's SoHo neighborhood and couldn't help but stare at her vintage pale blue coat. But when we got closer, it was her sleek and shiny hair that grabbed our attention.  Although she raved about her Philip B. Shampoo -- \"It's a nice brand with all organic ingredients\" -- she told us her secret to having fresh-looking tresses. \"I put apple cider vinegar in my hair,\" she says, adding, \"my hair is really fine and it gets oily really easily -- I find that the apple cider gives it a better texture.\"  And Livers reveals that, \"it gives it a shine and keeps it from looking stringy,\" which is all we needed to know to integrate apple cider vinegar into our next hair treatment.

After an interview in The Sun quoted the supermodel as saying she wished she had a smaller chest, and sent the Internet into a frenzy, Ms. Upton took to Twitter to denounce the claims, stating she was misquoted and, in fact, loves her body. Her tweets, which accuse the quotes as a being way to \"drum up controversy,\" set the record straight. While the supermodel admits that she's a normal person who feels insecure at times, she's proud of her body just the way it is.  We must say when we first heard the news that the 21-year-old \"wished for smaller boobs,\" we were kind of confused. After all, her body, along with all of its curves, are what makes her so special and unique as a model.  And really, who could hate on this? "

An orphaned, unmarried administrative assistant died with millions in the bank. A lot of rich people aren't exceptionally talented at what they do. They just have quirks and habits that let them think differently about money than the rest of us. Here are three I've noticed.  They are (mostly pleasant) sociopaths I'm convinced that nearly every rich person has the characteristics of a sociopath. Not in a cruel, soulless way. But sociopaths can disregard emotional events that cause normal people to worry and panic. Great investors can do that, too. They can watch stocks fall 50 percent and shrug their shoulders or see 10 million people lose their jobs and remain unshakably calm. In her book Confessions of a Sociopath, M.E. Thomas writes: Sharks see in black-and-white. Scientists have suggested that contrast against background may be more helpful than color for predators in detecting potential prey, helping them to focus on crucial spatial relationships rather than extraneous details. I'm color-blind in a way that makes mass hysteria seem particularly striking in contrast to normal, expected behavior. My lack of empathy means I don't get caught up in other people's panic. It gives me a unique perspective. And in the financial world, being able to think opposite the pack is all you need. Napoleon's definition of a military genius was \"The man who can do the average thing when all those around him are going crazy.\" Rich people are similar. They remain normal when everyone else can't. They care about time periods most can't comprehend There are four ways to invest: Long-term investing is the only sane choice. But it's unnatural. We're hardwired to grab immediate gains and avoid immediate threats. That's why we eat donuts and watch CNBC. My friend Carl Richards made a great sketch last week:  As Carl notes, studies show that we have the same emotional connection to ourselves 30 years in the future as we do an unknown third-party today. Rich people have the rare ability to bridge that emotional gap. They are allergic to the short run. \"If you look carefully,\" Bill Bonner writes in his book Family Fortunes, \"almost all Old Money secrets can be traced to a single source: a longer-term outlook.\" In August 1929, John Raskob wrote an article called \"Everyone Ought to Be Rich.\" All you had to do was buy stocks and hold them for a long time, he wrote. Two months later, the market crashed. It fell 88 percent over the next four years. To this day, people cite Raskob's article as a sign of irrational hype. But was it? Anyone who bought stocks the day it hit the stands increased their wealth six-fold over the next 30 years, adjusted for inflation. Missing this is why everyone ought to be rich, but few are. They don't give a damn what you think of them Dilbert creator Scott Adams once wrote: \"One of the best pieces of advice I've ever heard goes something like this: If you want success, figure out the price, then pay it. It sounds trivial and obvious, but if you unpack the idea it has extraordinary power.\" The price of being rich is really simple: You must live below your means. But living below your means is hard. Most people want to be rich to impress other people. They do this by spending money, which is the surest way to have less of it. The reason so many Americans are in dire financial shape is because their aspirations, desires, and wants have grown faster than their incomes. That's why the size of the median home has increased by 30 percent over the last 25 years while the median income has barely budged. For every $1 raise most people receive, their desires grow by perhaps $1.10. This is the express lane to disappointment. Rich people avoid this trap. They care less about what others think of them than ordinary people do. They don't give a damn, actually. They can get a raise without buying a new car or have a great year in the market and not blow it on a new watch. A lot of them are after control over their time, which comes from having a wide gap between what they can afford to buy and what they actually buy. They are more impressed with retiring early than $90 T-shirts or $20 cocktails. It's classic Millionaire Next Door stuff. Having the emotional backbone to drive an uglier car than you can afford, live in a smaller house you can afford, eat out less often than you can afford, and wear cheaper clothes than you can afford is rare. In my experience, less than 10 percent of people can do it in a meaningful way. It's the cost of being rich, and most people have no desire to pay the price. \"A miser grows rich by seeming poor,\" poet William Shenstone wrote. \"An extravagant man grows poor by seeming rich.\" I don't think it's any more complicated than that.

Why? Well, we haven't had a substantial correction in quite some time. By definition, most would agree that a correction is 10 percent or more. In my previous post, \"The Most Dangerous Time In The Stock Market,\" I talked about being lulled to indifference by a long stretch of good times. So when a correction takes place after these long calm times, investors tend to freak out. While in the middle of these declines, it's absolutely impossible to judge whether it's a slight dip or the beginning of a more prolonged corrections. First, I want to share some statistics regarding how often the market corrects. Then, I will give you some suggestions on how to take advantage of the correction without the freak out part. Here are some stock market correction stats: 15 percent Corrections happen once every two years and last over 200 days Remember, each correction will be different. They will have different lengths, frequencies and intensities. Now I want to share some tips for avoiding the freak out and taking advantage of the correction: 1. Invest regularly. Whether times or good or bad, you have the ability to make additional contributions to an IRA or a 401(K). Adding money during a decline allows you to buy more shares while the prices are on sale. Instead of giving in to the freak out during a dip, think of it as an opportunity to pick up some stuff cheap! 2. Avoid jumping in and out. Market timing is a fool's game. You will do more damage getting in and out of the market. If you are long-term investor, stay put and weather the storm. Getting out when times are bad is fairly easy. It's knowing when it's time to get back in that is the challenge. 3. Consider international investments or alternatives. If you think that the U.S. market is not doing well, why not add international investments to your portfolio? Not every country on the planet is in corrective mode. This may be the portion of your portfolio that performs well and helps your overall return. Consider adding some alternative investments, like commodities, managed futures or REITs. Most of these don't move with the market. They do their own thing and may make money when the stock market is declining. 4. Talk to your financial advisor. Your advisor will definitely have some words of encouragement that will make you feel better. An advisor can give you the perspective you need when you feel the urge to freak out over a market correction. Have the advisor do an update on your financial plan. That way you can see just how much a correction affects your long-term goals. Remember, market corrections are a part of investing, like it or not. Stick with your plan.

Well, now it looks like someone has gotten their hands on the unretouched versions, and has leaked them to fan sites like Gaga Daily. Looking at the shots, we have to admit we are a bit perplexed. Sure, the singer looks different -- she has been subject to the same heinous Photoshop crimes we've seen before -- skin perfecting, hair lightening, arm slimming. But most noticeably, it looks like Gaga had her makeup digitally added, too.  Maybe we're just being optimistic, but it really looks like the singer is totally barefaced in the original photos. Of course, that raises the question of why they didn't just put a little makeup on her in the first place? Maybe some foundation or at least a little ChapStick? This is not the first time Gaga has been subject to Photoshop controversy. Back in 2012 there was heavy speculation surrounding her \"Vogue\" cover. Still, if we take into consideration how much makeup and enhancement we see on celebs every day, Gaga looks pretty freaking good.  Check out one of the before and after shots below.     "

In the video above, Birchbox staffer Whitney shows us how to master the messy French twist in under two minutes. This classic yet fresh hairdo is perfect for those of us who want to look pulled together when we're really just trying to pull it together.  To get this version of the messy French twist, you'll need dry shampoo, salt spray, pomade, bobby pins, hairspray and a brush. Start by using the dry shampoo to remove excess oils from your strands. Next, backcomb your hair at the crown to build volume. For added texture, spritz the salt spray directly to the midsection and use a dryer to soak up extra water. Then scrunch your hair up into loose, tousled waves. Take a quarter size amount of pomade and work it through the midsection and ends of hair. Roll your locks around your finger toward your head and secure with bobby pins. Gently pull hair pieces apart for roughness, and then finish the style with a blast of hairspray.  Easy peasy, right? "

This year, I'm especially excited because our new President's Advisory Council on Financial Capability for Young Americans is all about taking action to truly help America's kids grow into money-savvy adults. At our first meeting in DC just a few weeks ago, we had a great discussion about the goals of this Council. Ideas were flying: Embed financial education in the Common Core standards; create technologies that help kids of all ages improve their money habits; ensure that employers provide young workers with the necessary tools to start saving early and keep their careers on the right track. All excellent! But no matter where, or how, our children are getting their financial education, here's something that I know for sure: Parents are hungry to teach their kids the basics of personal finance. Test your kids' fin lit with Money as You Grow On the previous President's Advisory Council on Financial Capability, I helped create MoneyAsYouGrow.org, an interactive tool offering the 20 essential things parents need to teach kids about money from ages 3 to 23. With no marketing or PR budget, the site has had more than one million visits since it was launched at the White House, and continues to get about 25,000 more each month. It's one thing for a video of a cat wearing ice skates to go viral -- but a personal finance website? Check out the site this month and see if your child knows the four money milestones for his/her age group -- and report back to me in the comments below. Help teens afford college College grads have much higher lifetime earnings than people who don't go to college. One way to increase enrollment? Get more families to fill out the FAFSA -- the Free Application for Federal Student Aid. More than one million high school seniors who should fill out the FAFSA don't, leaving millions of dollars of grant money on the table. One recent study found that when a professional helps a family fill out the FAFSA, they not only get them more financial aid, but we see a 20% boost in college enrollment overall. (For more tips for families, see my College Cost Checklist.) So, what can this Council do? Let's help bring together partners to create a FAFSA Corps -- like AmeriCorps and Peace Corps -- to teach families how to fill out the FAFSA. Let's offer colleges incentives to use work/study dollars to train college students to help. And let's make sure high school guidance counselors know about the new Financial Aid Toolkit, a one-stop shop for college counseling materials. Start 'em young: Have the money talk with your toddler Everyone knows there's real momentum for Universal Pre-K, which the President has spoken about it in each of his last two State of the Union addresses. Meanwhile, research by Karen Holden from the University of Wisconsin-Madison shows that preschoolers are capable of understanding basic financial concepts like value and exchange, delayed gratification, and making choices. So, let's get financial literacy content into Universal Pre-K efforts by bringing together educators, behavioral economists, and gaming experts to educate our youngest learners. (Worth noting: The most visited section of MoneyAsYouGrow.org, by far, is the one for 3- to 5-year-olds.) Send us your suggestions for the President's Council Ultimately, this Council will make recommendations to the President that will, we hope, pave the way for all of the nation's children to learn essential financial lessons that can improve their lives.

      "text": "Dear Readers,  According to a January 2014 Schwab Money Myths survey, no matter how savvy we think we are, there are still a lot of financial misconceptions floating around out there. And surprisingly, a number of those misconceptions aren't about esoteric investing theories; they're about everyday financial situations.  To help you avoid these common misconceptions -- and perhaps help your loved ones avoid them, too -- I'm going to share not only the myths, but also the facts. After all, a little financial reality can go a long way toward helping you protect yourself and meet your goals. Myth 1: A will is the best way to ensure your property will be distributed the way you want.  That would seem to make sense. But the problem is that many people forget that they've already designated beneficiaries on many of their financial accounts, such as IRAs and on their insurance policies. Or they think that a will overrides those designations. However, the opposite is true.  If there's a discrepancy between beneficiaries named on your financial accounts and those named in your will, your financial accounts will prevail. So while a will is an important part of your estate plan, you also need to update your beneficiary designations to make sure you don't inadvertently leave something to an unintended recipient, such as an ex-spouse.  Myth 2: It's important to eliminate all debt by the time you retire. It really depends on the type of debt you have -- \"good\" debt or \"bad\" debt. Good debt is low interest and tax deductible, such as a mortgage. Bad debt is high interest and non-deductible -- think credit cards. Your personal circumstances and tax situation will help determine how much debt to eliminate and when. To me, credit card debt should always be the first to go. Myth 3: After you retire, you can always get another job if you need more money. Continuing to work, at least part-time, is a great idea for a lot of reasons, but the reality is that while more than one in three workers in our survey (39 percent) said they expect to get income from a part time job in retirement, only 4 percent of those who are currently retired actually do. Often, the reason has to do with health issues. Plus, the current job market doesn't make it any easier. Myth 4: Every adult should have life insurance. Do you have young children? Are you supporting other dependents? Do you own a small business? Or do you have significant liabilities that will continue after you die? If you answered yes to any of these questions, life insurance may make sense. Otherwise, it could be a waste of money. Myth 5: You should start taking Social Security as soon as you're eligible. If you wait to take your benefits starting at age 70, they will be 76 percent higher than if you start at age 62. Of course, you also have to factor in your current needs, health, spousal benefits and family history of longevity before you make this important decision.  Myth 6: You should purchase long-term care insurance when you're in your 40s or younger. It sounds right because younger people have a lower premium. But on the other hand, you'll be paying that premium for a longer period of time, increasing the total cost. Bottom line? If you're in good health, the ideal time to consider long-term care insurance is between ages 50 and 65. Myth 7: Retirees shouldn't have their money in the stock market. While it's often recommended that you decrease the percentage of stocks in your portfolio as you get older, keeping a certain amount in a combination of stocks, stock mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) is good protection against inflation no matter your age. You don't want to risk money that you'll need in the short-term, but there's such a thing as being too conservative -- especially if you anticipate a long retirement. Myth 8: If you need cash while you're still working, a 401(k) plan is a good place to turn for a loan or a withdrawal. To me a 401(k) loan should be a last resort unless it's an emergency. First, you're immediately depleting your retirement savings. Second, you're risking taxes and penalties if for some reason you can't pay it back on time. Third, if you leave your job for any reason, you'll need to pay back the loan ASAP. And finally, regardless of when you pay back the loan, you do so with after-tax dollars, which gets taxed again when you withdraw the money in retirement. Myth 9: By the time you're 50, it's too late to make a difference in your financial future. Absolutely not true! You likely have 15-plus years of saving ahead of you. More than a third of working Americans in our survey don't plan to retire until 70. If you save diligently and take advantage of catch-up contributions for both 401(k)s and IRAs, those extra years can make a significant difference in your financial future.  If all of this seems obvious to you, great. But don't take anything for granted. The financial world continues to change and challenge us all. If you're uncertain about something, get help. And be sure to talk to your loved ones -- especially your spouse. To me, it's important that both adults in a household understand and share responsibility for money management decisions. Pass that knowledge and responsibility on to your kids, and you'll be helping them take control of their own financial reality.  Looking for answers to your retirement questions?

Besides food, clothing and school supplies, a whole host of extracurricular activities are competing for a share of your wallet -- even as you frantically try to save for college and your own retirement.  One of the biggest expenses you'll encounter is prom. Gone are the days of borrowing dad's suit and crepe paper streamers in the school gym: Today's proms are often more like a Hollywood premiere with limousines, designer gowns and swanky after-parties.  I'm not kidding. According to a recent nationwide survey conducted by my employer, Visa Inc., the average U.S. family with a high school student attending the prom expects to spend $978 this year. Surprisingly, that's down 14 percent from last year's survey average of $1,139 per family.  As with weddings and vacations, spending on prom can easily spiral out of control, especially if your teenager isn't used to sticking to a budget. Use this as a learning experience by getting your kid involved making tough decisions, helping to prioritize expenses from vital to non-essential. If they want to exceed your agreed-to budget, a part-time job might be in order.  To help with the prom budgeting process, Visa launched a free smartphone app last year called Plan'it Prom. You simply enter your budgeted amounts for each item and then track actual spending on your phone or tablet as you shop. The app also includes budgeting tips, a photo gallery and a timeline for tracking pre-prom deadlines. Plan'it Prom is available at the iTunes store, the Google Play store and from Practical Money Skills for Life. Bottom line: You want to ensure your child has a memorable high school experience, but not at the expense of your overall budget. If you need help making a budget, numerous online tools are available at sites such as the U.S. Financial Literacy and Education Commission's MyMoney.gov, the National Foundation for Credit Counseling and Practical Money Skills for Life, a free personal financial management program run by Visa Inc.

      "text": "Since founding my namesake brand in 1985, I've continued to look at my key sources of inspiration through a new lens each season. I built my brand on the East Coast Ivy League look -- it's heritage prep and, above all, classic Americana. Each season my collections are rooted in this tradition, always with a modern twist. With the Spring 2014 To Tommy, From Zooey capsule collection, designed in collaboration with Zooey Deschanel, I've had a chance to revisit some of my earliest inspirations and favorite style icons, and reinterpret these influences with a fresh perspective. I love looking at the silhouettes, colors, prints and fabrics worn by idols, from Grace Kelly and Jackie Onassis to modern day trend-setters like Charlotte Gainsbourg, Jessica Alba and Zooey Deschanel. I've always been a fan of Zooey's unique, timeless style, and after meeting her at a brunch in Los Angeles last year, I asked her to collaborate on designing a collection of feminine, playful dresses and accessories. Following red carpet launch events in LA and Mexico City last week, the To Tommy, From Zooey capsule collection is now available online and in select Tommy Hilfiger and Macy's stores. It combines Zooey's youthful, vintage-inspired style with the classic, American, cool spirit at the heart of our brand. The clean-cut look of the 1960s was at the center of our design philosophy for the To Tommy, From Zooey capsule collection. My ultimate all-American style icon from that era is Jackie Kennedy, who defined glamour and grace. Jackie proved simple can be elegant; she knew how to wear clean lines and monochromatic pieces in a way that was still interesting. Her fashion legacy lives on in oversized sunglasses, capri pants, shift dresses and pillbox hats, which she single-handedly introduced to American fashion. I've also always admired Grace Kelly, who had a fairytale life and the style to match. Her V-neck gowns, skirt suits and ladylike pearls gave her a sophisticated, understated elegance. Grace's eye for fit and fabric was incredible; she knew how to effortlessly combine that \"girl next door\" charm with a hint of mystery. Audrey Hepburn was also a timeless beauty. She wasn't afraid to experiment and didn't shy away from menswear -- some of her best looks were tailored cropped pants, penny loafers and t-shirts. Marilyn Monroe was also a fashion role model in her own right; most people immediately think of her in that iconic white dress from The Seven Year Itch. Marilyn proved that the secret to great style is confidence, which remains one of my mottos for dressing today. The 1970s was a fantastic decade for fashion; I had just moved to New York to pursue a career as a designer and was inspired by the rise of icons like Farrah Fawcett and Ali McGraw. Aside from Farrah's signature blonde hair, she was a renowned trend-setter in the height of Charlie's Angles for making high-wasted jeans and plaid shirts the must-have pieces. I also admired the way Ali embraced '70s style, from micro shorts to boho prints. The 21st century is producing its own style icons. I think Charlotte Gainsbourg has a great look that's effortless and cool; she sticks to simple, monochromatic pieces but always gives them an edgy twist. I've also had the pleasure of working with Jessica Alba, who's like a modern-day Grace Kelly with her \"girl next door\" look. Jessica knows how to mix patterns, prints and colors for a style that's sometimes preppy, sometimes more rebellious and always feminine. And of course, there's Zooey Deschanel. When we started designing our capsule collection, we looked through all the styles Zooey has been wearing recently, and identified the key silhouettes and details she loves. Then we looked at everything through the lens of the Tommy Hilfiger brand DNA. We incorporated our signature red, white and blue, and combined vintage-inspired silhouettes with preppy accents to create this collection, which Zooey describes as \"modical\" -- a mix of mod and nautical influences. Zooey and I are both so excited by the outcome. The collection is very '60s inspired, which you can see it in the fun patterns and the short hems. The aesthetic is fun, classic and effortless -- in that sense, it reflects attributes that all my style icons have embodied over the years. After all, trends come and go, but great style is forever.

Financial troubles do not often appear out of nowhere, but if bad financial habits have become the norm, you may not see the warning signs. Here are five red flags that you may be heading towards financial trouble. 1. No Significant Savings or Emergency Fund A savings account is a necessity for any family, regardless of your income. Some may prefer a savings account that also functions as an emergency fund, while others may prefer a separate emergency account. The purpose of this emergency fund is to have money available when the unexpected happens. This could be something small, like an unexpected car repair, or a big event, like the loss of a job. The amount of money needed for an emergency fund varies based on where you live and the expenses you have. Generally, experts agree that there should be at least three months of income in the fund, possibly up to a year's worth. Living without a savings account or emergency fund is a gamble that may land you in serious financial trouble. [More from Manilla.com: How a 21-Day Financial Fast Saved Me Tons]  2. Borrowing to Pay Other Loans Maxed out credit cards, where users can barely pay the minimum due each month, are a true sign of financial trouble. Even worse are those who may find the need to begin borrowing at high interest rates for cash advances in order to pay other loans or bills. Borrowing from one credit card to pay another credit card or loan is a cycle that can only be sustained for so long before you will be unable to keep up. High interest pay day loans used to catch up on bills are also a bad idea and are usually a response to living paycheck to paycheck. Take a step back and evaluate your financial situation and what can be done to change it. 3. No Health Insurance  Living without health insurance or without enough insurance is a risk not worth taking. While some may argue that the cost of health insurance makes this bet worthwhile, one bad accident and you could find yourself over your head in medical debt. An emergency room visit or even a very short hospital stay can stack up tens of thousands in medical bills very quickly. Make sure your insurance provides enough coverage to keep your family out of financial trouble. [More from Manilla.com: Becoming Wealthy Starts By Thinking Like the Wealthy] 4. Credit Denial  Being denied credit should be like a big warning sign saying, \"You are in over your head.\" Most credit providers base this decision on credit history and credit score. A below-average credit score can mean lenders will charge a higher interest rate, but when lenders stop approving you for credit all together, this means trouble. A very low credit score can be caused by a combination of many factors. Some of these factors may include your debt to credit ratio, multiple late payments, and your total amount of debt owed. 5. Ignoring Debt Most families find they will have a need for credit at some point. Knowing how to use this credit appropriately can be a hard lesson to learn. Borrowers who choose to be ignorant of the amount of debt owed, or the fact that there is no end in sight for paying it off, need to make some changes quickly. Consumers can spend freely, ignoring the climbing debt only for so long before a financial disaster is in sight. Any loans or credit purchases should be made with a plan for how and when they will be paid off.

However, the supermodel is super down to earth.  Kerr hosted a private concert in New York on Tuesday evening with \"The Voice\" fan favorites Jacquie Lee, Will Champlin and Dia Frampton. I was able to snag 15 minutes with the Aussie-born beauty before the night's festivities were in full swing. Lucky me, right? Before we got cozy on a plush couch at The Crosby Hotel, Kerr was showering me with compliments over my big Afro puff and the neon green scarf I was sporting. We even took a selfie! All of our BFF-moments aside, I learned a great deal from the Clear Scalp & Hair global brand ambassador about her beauty regimen and what it really takes to be the absolute best version of yourself. On her shampooing ritual ... I wash it every second day unless I'm working back to back days, then I like to keep it fresh. There's nothing better for me after I've freshly washed my hair and I'll let it dry on its own. I just love that feeling of clean hair because it's like a little luxury in life. After I get off an airplane the first thing I do is wash my hair. If my hair is not clean I don't feel my best.  On the secret to her super shiny hair ... It's a combination of [things] like feeding my body from the inside, and I've been using Clear [hair products] for quite some time actually. I have noticed that it makes my hair strong and soft and lightweight at the same time, and that's something for me that I need. I like it because I feel like it nourishes the scalp, and their whole concept has been that we've been looking at the wrong end of hair. I used the shampoo and conditioner and nothing else. My hair gets so much work done to it with the industry I work in. It's constantly getting pulled, pushed and curled, and you feel like it's nice sometimes to have a blowout and no products.   On the many, many uses for coconut oil ...  I cook with it, use it in my hair, it's great to remove makeup ... really good for eye makeup if you've got sensitive eyes. If you have a burn, like if you've burned yourself with a curling iron, you can put a bit of that on there to help. Sometimes I sleep with coconut oil in my hair. The Clear Intense Hydration Mask, which has coconut oil in it, is good to put on the ends of your hair to smooth and keep nourished. I have an exfoliating cream in my line that is good for your face, but sometimes I like to mix it up and get sea salt and coconut oil or olive oil and scrub it all over my body. I feel like the sea salt is very invigorating and revitalizing.  On the one thing she does every day to unwind ... I meditate morning and night. I've practiced meditation and yoga for a long time. I guess since I was 16 and I'm about to turn 31. The importance for me taking that 10 minutes in the morning and 10 at night to just focus on my breath. I have other guided meditations that I've downloaded from iTunes and I have this little machine that was actually given to me by my osteopath. There's been so many studies that have come out about meditation and stillness of the mind and being present.  On if she would ever chop off her hair ... Oh, yeah! I wanted to cut my hair when I was pregnant. I had such an urge to cut it really short. I'd like to and you'll see I'm sure in a few years. I have a [faux bob] though. I like to mix it up. One day, I'll cut it for real. On her healthy hair diet ... I feel it is very important to get nutrients from the foods that we eat. For me, I eat salmon, avocado, macadamia oil, eating and cooking in coconut oil ... eating almonds and pine nuts. Having your Omega 3-6-9 is really important for the brain and skin. I do take a multitude of vitamins but I do like to mix it up with a smoothie in the morning that has maca powder, fresh coconut water, chia seeds, goji berries, acai powder and spirulina. I'll open and put my vitamins in the smoothie as well because I don't like to take the capsules. On the one beauty product she can't leave home without ... I can't leave home without having fresh, clean hair and my rosehip seed oil because it has your essential fatty acids and it's good to put on at night.  This has been edited for clarity and length. "

But, artist and photographer Noorann Matties changes our perception a bit with her photo series \"Rituals,\" which was featured in the Fog March 2014 issue of inconnu magazine. Matties' photography captures the space between a woman and a mirror -- the place that inhabits one of the most private interactions we have with our insecurities and confidences.  In her introduction to the series, Matties notes \"this intimacy that occurs only when one is forced to examine their own body, the most basic thing that is theirs, and build upon it,\" and it's interesting to see how these examinations and \"rituals\" of changing oneself alters from photograph to photograph.  While the constant between these images is the presence of a mirror (although in various shapes and sizes), we still find variations of poses, facial expressions, vantage points and environments, which highlights the possibility that the practice of beauty routines is independent from the outside world while also acting as a response to how we publicly see ourselves.

The British babe has shed her \"Harry Potter\" image in favor of something a little more sophisticated ... or has she? Though the Internet seems to think that Watson's fashion chops are new, it seems like the actress' style choices haven't changed that much. And we have proof.  In honor of her 25th birthday, we're taking a look at her style back in the day, compared to what she is wearing now. And trust us, things haven't really changed...  Though she never blends in, Watson has been a fan of camouflage for some time now.   She knows that when in doubt, a simple black dress is always a safe bet.   A brown leather jacket works at 12 years old and at 23 years old.   A military jacket is as timeless as it is stylish.   She has never been afraid of being the center of attention in a printed dress.   Though many shy away from off-the-shoulder silhouettes, Watson has made it one of her signatures.   Soft ruffles are perfect for a young teen, but they also add a feminine touch for a young adult.   Teal doesn't work on everyone, but it definitely agrees with Emma.   "

      "text": "A few weeks ago the refund from my federal tax return was deposited into my bank account. I had two reactions, almost simultaneously. The first was, \"Woo-hoo! Fun times!\" The second was, \"I should probably save this. Be responsible.\"  I'd like to think that I'm not alone in my indecisiveness on this issue. After all, tax season is one of those times when a lot of people get money from the federal government. Of course, the amount might vary, with some people getting a sizable check and others getting little. Nevertheless, it's a little pick-me-up for most of us. The sun is finally starting to shine. Trees are blooming. And, hey, here's some money!  As someone who studies psychology and consumer behavior, tax season is also a great research opportunity. It raises all sorts of questions, such as why people file when they do, whether they lie on their returns, and, most relevant to my quandary, how people are planning to spend their refund. I got answers to these questions from a survey we conducted at the Georgetown Institute for Consumer Research.  Is Getting a Big Refund Like Winning the Lottery? There seems to be a general belief around this time of the year that if you're getting a refund, then you should spend it on something fun. All the ads urging us to go out and splurge certainly seem to think so. But is that really the case? Not quite. In fact, consumers seem to view the refund as money they have been counting on. In the survey conducted by the Institute, 54 percent of respondents said they viewed the refund as money they were owed, or as a self-imposed savings account. In other words, consumers don't view the refund as a surprise gift from the federal government that they could party with. Instead, this is money that many consumers have already allocated toward something. Given this perception of the refund, the big question becomes what people are planning to spend their refund on. Where Is the Refund Going? For most tax payers, it's been a tough few years. Though the recession began six years ago, the effects are still being felt by most people. Consequently, it's not surprising that most survey respondents wanted to use the bulk of their refund (84 percent of it, on average) in a responsible manner (e.g., by saving, investing, paying down debt, or making a necessary purchase). But surely some people are planning to use some of their refund for something fun? Surely I'm not the only one who wanted to use some of my refund to indulge myself?  Indeed, I'm not alone. While a large portion of the refund is going to be spent responsibly, consumers are planning to use a small portion for something fun. In fact, about 12 percent of the refund, on average, is being allocated for an extravagance. However, some consumers plan to use more of their refund in this way than others. There were two factors in particular that influenced the extent to which the refund would be used to make an extravagant purchase. One of the factors is family structure. Consumers without children are planning to devote more of their refund (14 percent, on average) toward a nonessential purchase than those with children (9 percent, on average). This is understandable given that those with children are likely to have more financial burdens than those without children. The other factor that determines how much of the refund is allocated toward an extravagance is the amount of the refund. Who do you think will spend more of their refund in this way: those who are getting a relatively big refund (at least $3,000), or those who are getting a small refund (less than $3,000)? I predicted that those getting a big refund would be the ones spending more of it on an extravagance. However, the data tell a different story.  In fact, it was the people getting more money who were less likely to splurge. Among those who are getting a relatively large refund, only 9 percent were planning to use at least some of it for purchasing a treat. However, among those expecting a relatively small refund, 35 percent were planning to use some of their refund on an extravagance. Doesn't that seem a little crazy to you? After all, if you're getting a bigger refund, you should be more willing to splurge a little, right? This might be the case, but I realized that it's also possible that those getting a small refund think it won't be enough to make a dent in their financial obligations. Consequently, these consumers might conclude that it's better to spend more of their refund on something nonessential.  Problem Solved So if you've been wondering what to do with that refund money lying in your bank account, then you could go along with what most consumers are planning to do. Use the majority of it in a responsible manner, and take a small chunk to celebrate.  Check out our full Tax Refund Report here.  Have a question about consumer behavior that you'd like answered?

On top of all this trauma, Nayanda was diagnosed with Autoimmune hepatitis, which led to a liver transplant and constant trips to the hospital. Today, Nayanda is faced with many challenges due to her illness. She takes medicine daily and tries her best to manage her life to avoid all forms of stress. She does whatever is necessary to keep as healthy as possible so that her body does not reject her new liver. Nayanda is a strong, beautiful young woman who in addition to suffering great loss has to live with the daily fact that, at any moment, her disease could flare up, causing her body to attack itself and possibly leading to death.  I learned of Nayanda's traumatic story when my friend and leading anti-violence activist Erica Ford nominated her for a day of GLAM4GOOD pampering. Ford is the founder of Life Camp, an organization whose mission is to nurture the culture of peace in New York City. \"Nayanda and her family have been part of our organization for over ten years,\" Ford told me. \"Nayanda's mother and father were very dedicated volunteers at Life Camp. After the wrongful murder of her brother and death of her mother, it was from a broken heart that our organization played a tremendous role in helping Nayanda and her family to heal and move on from the trauma of loss.\" Ford believed a much deserved day of fashion and beauty pampering from GLAM4GOOD would help Nayandas spirit. \"I nominated Nayanda,\" Ford said \"because, as a young girl who has faced so much trauma in her life, I knew that a day of joy, beauty and fashion would be good for her as she continues to heal and live a life of happiness.\"  What struck me about Nayanda during the special day of pampering my GLAM4GOOD team created for her was how enthusiastic, big-hearted and energetic she was! From the moment Nayanda walked through the door she lit up the room. This was a young lady that clearly loved fashion and was ready and excited for her day of GLAM4GOOD. In the time we spent together, I asked her how she keeps positive after all she has been through and what she would tell other kids who are suffering the loss of a loved one or are dealing with a life-threatening illness. Her answer startled me. It was so thoughtful, powerful and mature: Each and every day, I am trying to get through. I'm learning to find the positive in every negative. I want kids that are going through traumatic experiences or who have suffered loss to know that everyone heals differently. It is okay to hurt, to feel sad, to cry, but you have to remember not to let that pain overcome you. You are allowed that moment to cry, reminisce, scream, whatever else helps, but never give up. As my brother used to say, \"everything happens for a reason.\" Stay strong because it may just be your story that one day saves someone else's life. Our styling session was filled with laughter as we tried on a rack full of dresses. Nayanda looked great in everything but picked a gorgeous pale pink BCBG peplum gown. She loved the dress because it was strapless and showed off the tattoo of her Mother's name over her heart. Next up, hair, makeup and manicures! \"My favorite thing about fashion is it doesn't only affect your outside, but your inside, too.\" Nayanda said. \"I wish all women could be granted GLAM4GOOD. This isn't just a physical makeover, but a mental and spiritual one as well.\"  One of the reasons I created GLAM4GOOD was so I could harness the positive aspects of fashion and beauty to celebrate courage and perseverance in the face of great difficulty, tragedy and pain. Nayanda was right, GLAM4GOOD is more than just a makeover -- often it's about honoring and acknowledging everyday heroism and bravery.  Soon Nayanda was ready for her big reveal. My team and I planned a special party so she could show off her beautiful new look and celebrate her bright future with her family and friends. Nayanda walked into the room looking incredibly glamorous, beaming with pride. Her loved ones cheered, many moved to tears. As Nayanda hugged her father, Erica Ford, her mentor and nominator, told me she believed that this experience had given Nayanda \"happiness and a space where she could find joy in the midst of pain.\" The truth is, Nayanda was already stunning... a gorgeous, resilient survivor. And GLAM4GOOD had the honor of highlighting the beauty that was already there. I am proud to present this video of Nayanda's personal story and her GLAM4GOOD experience. This is the first time Nayanda has ever spoken publicly about what she has gone through or her continuing battle against autoimmune disease. She told me her time with me and my team, as well as the constant support from her mentor and nominator Erica Ford, has empowered her to speak out to help other young women going through difficult times. She hopes that this post will inspire people to keep facing their challenges and pushing forward despite their obstacles. \"Maybe if they see how much I've gone through and endured, it will help them\" she says, \"because sometimes I can't even believe how far I've come myself.\" Check out photos from Nayanda's day of GLAM4GOOD in the slideshow below: "

While you might have the urge to splurge, here are some tips to help you decide -- and plan ahead -- for what to do with your tax refund: 1. Put your refund money into savings. Forty percent of U.S. households live paycheck to paycheck, and more than one-third admit to rarely being able to save enough money. A federal tax refund is one of the largest lump sums of money the average American household receives all year, so using your tax refund to create a financial cushion can make a huge difference. 2. Pay off high interest debt. If you have credit card debt, consider using your refund to pay down debt on the cards that charge the highest interest rates. 3. Increase retirement account contributions. Using all or a portion of your tax refund for retirement contributions can give you great returns on your investment.  4. Improve the value of your home. Consider applying your tax refund toward home improvements you've been putting off, like that kitchen remodel or bathroom upgrade. It will make your home more enjoyable and can significantly increase your home's value. 5. Take a vacation. If you've already paid down your debt, increased your retirement savings and in general have been responsible with your money, great - you've earned a vacation! It's always important to reward yourself, but try not to spend every single cent just because you have it. Did you know today marks the 101st Tax Day in American history? So while you might be thanking Uncle Sam for your refund, interestingly enough, while April 15 is the date that is engrained in everyone's mind, most taxpayers have no idea why Tax Day is on or around April 15 every year. To help you understand where these traditions started, here's a little history behind Tax Day: The History of Tax Day: 101 Years in the Making On February 3, 1913, Congress ratified the 16th Amendment, giving them the authority to enact an income tax. Prior to 1913, there were no income taxes other than those raised during the Civil War. When Congress passed the income tax law in 1913, a joint-filing couple that made more than $4,000 in taxable income after all deductions was subject to a one percent tax rate. With inflation, that $4,000 is equal to roughly $93,700 now. So why is tax day on April 15? The first income tax day in U.S. history was on March 1, 1914. Four years later, Congress passed the \"Revenue Act,\" which moved tax day forward by two weeks to March 15, where it remained in effect until 1955. Why the change to April 15? Historians believe there are two reasons that Congress chose to push income tax day to April 15: first, it gave the IRS a month longer to go through the income tax returns (imagine the piles of paper before the ability to e-file). Secondly, it let Uncle Sam hang onto the collected money a little longer before issuing refunds. Another interesting fact is tax day cannot fall on a Saturday, Sunday, or a holiday, according to the United States tax code. Tax day can also not fall on April 16 since that's the date of Emancipation Day, a legal holiday in Washington, D.C., celebrating the freeing of American slaves. If you're one of the millions of taxpayers who still need to file your return before the tax deadline, today is the last day you can file with the IRS. If you haven't filed yet, don't panic. There's still time! You can go online and e-file your federal and state tax returns until 11:59pm on April 15th. If you don't think you'll make the deadline and are considering filing an extension (or not filing at all), here are six reasons why you should file now vs. filing for an extension.

While time is ticking for you to complete your taxes, don't get so caught up trying to file that you make a mistake! That will only cause a bigger headache down the line. Follow these tax tips if you're filing for an extension. Even if you're filing at the last minute, take full advantage of all the deductions and credits that are available to you. If you have kid under the age of 18, paid for college for college for yourself or a child, or own a home -- you qualify for a deduction. For homeowners, specifically, be sure to take advantage of these tax breaks when you file: While procrastinators mull their filing options, lawmakers are considering whether to renew federal tax benefits set to expire this year that would affect thousands of homeowners. Recently, the Senate Finance Committee approved an extension of a deduction related to mortgage debt \"forgiven\" by lenders on short sales, foreclosures, or loan modifications on their primary residences. Homeowners have been able to enjoy the deduction since 2007. Without it, thousands of homeowners would be on the hook for taxes on the mortgage amounts that have been canceled, which could amount to tens of thousands of dollars. The bill also includes a number of other extensions impacting homeowners, including deductions for mortgage insurance premiums and energy-saving improvements to homes. The bill must now pass the full Senate and the House of Representatives. Some other tax tips you shouldn't forget: Daryl Paranada is a writer for MyBankTracker.com. "

I remember wearing my wedding dress anyways and feeling empowered by the reaction I got. I got cast as a Brooklyn hipster, Chinese delegate and upscale barhopper -- all in one season of \"House of Cards.\" I love looking at characters and their wardrobes on television because they're supposed to reflect the real world, stereotypically. Dressing up or down is like acting or putting on a show in real life. Fabric and the way it's stitched together tells a story and in the end, you embody the person you project. The point is -- clothes make part of who we are, want to become or seem to be. Human instinct allows for instant judgment and inferences based on material pieces and the way they and you are put together, effortlessly or not. After all, we are naturally visual people.  So if we own our clothes, why don't we more often own our looks?  Clothes are a form of expression and we could gain something by being less risk-averse. Finding your personal style is a matter of taking some risks and seeing what sticks outside your comfort zone.  On job interviews, at home or at work, we tend to be more conservative and try to fit in with the office culture. At times, you want to blend in with your peers. I recently spent a good fifteen minutes deciding between Chanel smoking slippers and ankle boots (flats won) because I was excited/anxious about eating at the Conde Nast cafeteria. I dreamt about meeting Anna Wintour. I didn't, but I remember what I wore, just in case. For me, I thought, it was about making my own mark in the environment of possibilities. A few days later, I attended a mixer at an art gallery. I didn't know anyone, and I wore a Russian bomber hat. I decided to be inspired by the setting. No one else had anything on their heads. I stuck out like a thimble on a thumb. Men wanted to feel the fuzziness. One girl who said she could never pull it off. Not true. I am simply emboldened by my fashion choices.  (Photo courtesy: IvyConnect) That's where \"outfit of the day\" comes in. There are more than 26 million posts tagged #ootd on Instagram. Whoever started it, was onto something. Knowing how to work it on your own terms will help you work a room, if you want. Clothes can give you confidence to start conversations or cloak you with insecurities to transform you a backdrop. I mean, think about it -- you'd be naked otherwise so why don't we bare different sides of ourselves when we get a chance? Dress without fear and you'll leave the door, without self-judgment.  Here are some additional tips:  Experiment -- just once, just a little and see what happens. Remember, you can always take the edge off. Maybe start with accessories. When shopping, there's no shame in going straight to the sales rack or ask for a discount, like no sales tax.  "

The frowning feline knocked it out of the park when she arrived on the red carpet at the 2014 MTV Awards in what we can only assume is a piece from Vivienne Westwood's new cat-inspired collection. And we have to say, there was something different about her. Perhaps the grumpy gal was even feeling a bit ... \"Happy\"? Grumpy Cat finished off the look with pretty much nothing else besides her famous scowl. After all, she's a cat. We're not saying that the cat wore it better than Mr. Williams. But we're not not saying it, either. See it for yourself below!   "

In fact, the singer is more likely to be spotted with a rainbow of colors in her hair or a dress that leaves little to the imagination. But that all changed at the 2014 MTV Movie Awards. The singer attended the ceremony as a presenter just ahead of her acting debut in the upcoming comedy \"The Other Woman.\" She looked absolutely stunning (and dare we say natural!) in a black, skintight Alexander McQueen dress. She finished off the look flawlessly with sleek, side-swept hair, minimal makeup and gold jewelry.  We have to admit we are loving this \"less-is-more\" look. What do you think?    "

      "text": "There's a magical quality about movie stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood. As part of the studio system, women would receive complete makeovers and regular beauty regimes to match up with the reputation the studio wanted to build around them. If a young hopeful was signed, hair and makeup were paramount to her success. A lion's share of those glamour gal makeovers took place at the Max Factor Building, which is now a must-see museum at North Highland and Hollywood Boulevard. A classic film buff, I was determined to add this museum to my itinerary on my recent trip to Hollywood. From the moment I entered, I was greeted with Art Deco grandeur. Bathed in pink, the great room features marble and gold columns, built-in shelving lined with memorabilia, and vitrines filled with vintage Max Factor beauty products and paraphernalia.   Blondes to the Left, Redheads to the Right Beyond the impressive lobby are four beauty chambers labeled: \"For Redheads Only,\" \"For Blondes Only,\" \"For Brunettes Only,\" and \"For Brownettes Only.\" While some entered to have their hair and make up aligned, others were completely transformed.  Most people know that one of Hollywood's most famous redheads, Lucille Ball, was actually not a redhead at all. She became one at Max Factor. It's also where Marilyn Monroe went from 'brownette' to blonde.  Each room contains photos of stars that got the Max Factor treatment, and while all four are fantastic, I really loved the \"Redheads Only\" chamber. Photos of some of my favorites, including Barbara Stanwyck, Ann Sheridan and Rita Hayworth lined the walls. Of course, Lucille Ball took center stage. While many Hollywood stars became redheads at Max Factor, Lucy was probably the most famous in that both her overall hair color and make up combination was created here. To add to the fun, a 1950s TV set plays the famous \"Vitameatavegamin\" episode of I Love Lucy on repeat, and an original setting of Lucy Ricardo's china (Franciscan's Ivy pattern) is on display. On another screen, footage of Lucy holding court as head of Desilu Productions shows her looking lovely as a businesswoman.    The \"Blondes Only\" chamber includes a bustier worn by Marilyn Monroe in How to Marry a Millionaire and an article revealing her beauty secrets. There's also a contraption known as the \"Beauty Micometer,\" which looks like something out of a futuristic torture chamber. It is a helmet of sorts that was designed to assess a woman's face from all angles and contours. Because the screen could easily magnify any flaw, this device sought to seek them out and offer makeup solutions for them   A Brief History on Max Factor Just as with any museum visit, this trip gave me the opportunity to learn about history, invention and inspirational people. Until I visited, my only association with Max Factor was recalling Jaclyn Smith say \"Thanks, Max\" in those sassy 1980s commercials she did for the cosmetic line, which showed gratitude for its founder. I knew the products had a long history in Hollywood, but I had no idea how long or how Max Factor, the man, revolutionized the cosmetics industry. Long before his beauty products were available to the masses, Max Factor made his mark on Hollywood in the early days of cinema. A Polish immigrant, Factor began by creating custom-made wigs and makeup for the movies. Theatrical makeup didn't translate well from stage to screen, so Factor came up with what he called \"flexible greasepaint,\" which revolutionized the industry because it didn't crack. Factor was also famous for personally applying makeup to Hollywood stars to ensure they looked their absolute best on screen. Gloria Swanson, Joan Crawford, Jean Harlow, Bette Davis, Judy Garland and a bevy of others all got the personal treatment. As such many of these stars endorsed Max Factor cosmetics for little money, in exchange for publicity for their latest film. Many of these stars were regulars at the salon, where even non-celebrity clientele would get the Hollywood treatment.   Catty Quips and Digs Abound As immortalized in the 1939 Classic The Women, beauty parlors are famous breading grounds for gossip. As such, interspersed with the cosmetic and costume displays are some juicy framed quotes from silver screen queens. Here are three of my favorites: Only two people in Hollywood I ever wanted to meet: Garbo and Mae West. Now I've met them both, and I can go home and lie down. Don't think I don't know who's been spreading gossip about me and my temperament out there in Hollywood, where that film was made  I don't hate Bette Davis even though the press wants me to. I resent her -- I don't see how she built a career out of a set of mannerisms instead of real acting ability. Take away the pop eyes, the cigarette, and those funny clipped words and what have you got? She's phony, but I guess the public likes that.   The Max Factor Legacy When Max Factor died in 1938, his company was at the height of its success. His son took over the business and continued its reputation as an innovator and leader in the cosmetic industry. Milestones included a kiss-proof lipstick (actual kissing machines were made to test its endurance), a line of camouflage makeup that was used during WWII, a male line of products; fragrances, and eventually special industry lines created for television. Most of all, it seems, Max Factor revolutionized the beauty industry. He turned \"brownette\" starlets into \"redhead\" and \"blonde\" stars. He synchronized hair and makeup for the perfect look. Above all, he paved the way for every woman to look like a celebrity.   The Hollywood Museum The Max Factor Building holds much more than the history of beauty that unfolded underneath its roof. It's also home to the Hollywood Museum, and as such, it really contains something for everyone. There's a dungeon that contains shrines to Freddy Kruger and Hannibal Lecter, with original costumes and ephemera. On other floors there are wardrobe and props from television shows like Mad Men, The Walking Dead and The Beverly Hillbillies.  More to my liking...there are some great items like Cary Grant's Rolls Royce, gowns worn by Greta Garbo and Jean Harlow, and a room of photographs of stars gathering at awards ceremonies and watering holes like The Brown Derby. One of the wildest exhibits is actor Roddy McDowell's entire guest bathroom, which was lined with photos and memorabilia from his favorite silver screen colleagues. For fans of classic Hollywood, the building, the makeup studios and the overall museum are sensory overload and an absolute delight. I will undoubtedly return, because I couldn't possibly absorb everything in one go-round. (Did I mention there's an original pair of the ruby slippers on display?). In fact, the helpful guide told me that exhibits rotate, so there's always something new to see. I'm only hoping next time I can get a gander at that kissing machine.   "

      "text": "It's spring time and that means a whole new array of fashion and style items to update your closet and look. It doesn't matter what age or stage you are in life, a few fresh pieces of what's new from stores and brands can put a chic spin on your step as warmer weather hits. While it might seem that the key trends are just for the fashion forward consumer, there's always a way to work what's hot in the market your way. After all, fashion and style is meant to be all about you. The full skirt, or the 'party skirt,' is one of spring fashion's most popular new companion this year. It has a the classic fit at the waist with a full bodice that can varying in volume and length to fit any taste, body type or look. It tends to be best paired with a fitted top to balance out its big statement, but that doesn't mean you've got to go with the classic fitted cardigan. T-shirts, including those with a bit of a rocker edge, detailing or other element, can work just fine with this item. Halter tops, tank tops, and even cropped tops for those who dare to bare a little skin at the midriff can work too. Your shoe choices are equally workable -- flats, low heels, ankle straps, strappy sandals, wedges, etc. can all work. There's nothing wrong with experimenting with boots for this item -- play with ideas to get your own personal look. While you'll find this item at all kinds of price points, ranging from investment pieces to fast fashion, it doesn't take breaking the bank to bring it into your look. Online retailer eShakti has a range of styles at the mid-range price point. H&M has some options for those who are looking for a super deal. Speaking of boots, the spring and summer boot, cut ultra short to the ankle, is keeping pace as a casual footwear go-to. Brought to market first by designers like Isabel Marant, it's a pared down boot style that can work for spring jeans, shorts, skirts, dresses and pants for your casual weekends out and about or having lunch with friends. Watch the shaft height on your pick with this item -- where it hits on the leg can either elongate or shorten the proportions of your look. While this piece can range from ultra-boho and casual, you'll find more polished and classic styles as well. Dozens of fashion brands at all price points offers this piece -- Old Navy has a few styles for the budget conscious, and the choices go up from there. If it's not your cup of tea, the other big footwear trend for the season is the mule, which has gotten a chic and sophisticated update with modern styling, interesting details and a range of casual to dress looks. Heels are higher than the mule styles of the past, including a lot of wedges which are most on trend this year for this item. You'll want to work with the mule as you would any other basic shoe in your closet - pretend as if it is a neutral and wear it with whatever you want, day or evening. Clothing brand Vince, which expanded into footwear a few years ago, has some really cool mule choices for your spring looks.  When it comes to accessories for spring, jewelry has continued to reign the roost. The statement necklace, now many seasons as an 'it' item has waned a bit, but you'll still find any past pieces going strong as this is ultimately a classic fashion piece any year. The arm full of bracelets combined in a dizzying display has moved to the fingertips for a lot of fashion enthusiasts. The look is intentionally overloaded -- with knuckle rings mixed in along with multiple styles on several fingers. Don't be afraid to keep it simple or go big -- the key is to have more than one finger adorned with a ring to get this look. If you haven't caught the Bauble Bar bug for well priced, trendy jewelry, it's a must-visit.  While skinny jeans never go out of style, the soft pant is a huge player for spring this year. Cuts and styles play on the tapered vibe that champions the skinny pant, but rather than tight fabric through the hip, the look is loose and easy with the right amount of fit and flow. Fabrics tend to be in the rayon family, but you'll find cottons and even fleece choices that can work just as well. This pant is so popular you'll find styles nearly at most stores and most price points. Shopbop.com has a big variety including a great range of fabric choices, too. If the moto-jacket has grown tired in your closet, there are quite a bit of new choices coming into the picture for jackets this season. Bolero cuts and bombers in soft and simple fabrics are a good go-to to update your look.

That's right, the 21-year-old admitted to The Sun that she would actually prefer a smaller chest, and thinks Cameron Diaz, someone with a much smaller chest than Upton, has the \"perfect figure.\" She also has some ideas on how smaller boobs would make her life a little less difficult: \"Oh, man, it would be so much easier,' especially if people didn't constantly bring them up\u2026 If I could just take them off like they were clip-ons.\" Sorry, Kate, but we're not so sure how that would work out.

In the words of Tupac Shakur, \"You are appreciated.\" But sometimes, those bold risks take a very, very bad turn. For example, Katy Perry's post-breakup dye job.

The contrast between her strawberry blonde hair, bold lip color and yellow gown is absolutely stunning. BEST: Jennifer Garner   Garner looks super hot with this amazing blowout hairstyle, lush lashes and pale pink lipstick. She's giving us '70s bombshell! BEST: Freida Pinto   The 29-year-old actress and L'Oreal spokesmodel can do no wrong with this center-parted textured ponytail, deep purple eyeshadow and crimson red lip color.

BEST: Kate Bosworth   If we had to describe Bosworth's beauty look in one word, it would be perfection. WORST: Katy Perry   Ladies, let this be a hard lesson on what not to do with your hair after a breakup. Perry looks like a Troll doll with this bright green-and-black hairdo, but at least her makeup is flawless... WORST: Alesha Dixon   Dixon is such a naturally beautiful woman that we hate to see that get overshadowed (literally!) with dark makeup and awful ombre hair. WORST: Alanna Masterson  We barely recognized \"The Walking Dead\" actress underneath all of the heavy makeup. Between her obviously filled-in brows, thick top eyeliner and burgundy lips, we're not sure what's worse.  WORST: Nia Vardalos   This Greek-Canadian film star looks like she's stuck in another decade with this combover bangs and unflattering fuchsia lipstick.

Along with Wang's social media push, the line was revealed at the Coachella Music Festival, because of course it was. Additionally, Wang is the first American designer to partner up with H&M.

But one thing is for sure, the Duchess of Cambridge came prepared to dress for every occasion.  Day 7 was super busy for Kate and Prince William once they touched down in Dunedin, New Zealand to the sounds of bagpipes and a traditional Maori welcome from the Ngai Tahu tribe.  There was no missing the duchess, as she rubbed noses with her hosts dressed in an aquamarine Emilia Wickstead long-sleeve dress, matching Jane Taylor fascinator and hunter green high heels. We also peeped Kate sporting a diamond and platinum fern brooch loaned by Queen Elizabeth II. She looked picture-perfect as she strutted in the pleated design from the airport to a Palm Sunday service at St. Paul's Anglican Cathedral. The duchess then kicked off her heels and switched into a more casual outfit -- an ivory Jonathan Saunders sweater, skinny jeans and Mint Velvet gray sneakers -- to coach a game of tag rugby against her husband. And we must add that William looked fly in his navy pullover cardigan, khaki pants and white and green Onitsuka sneaks.  Kate and William kicked things up a notch with a high-speed jet boat ride on the Shotover River. Of course, she had to bring back her beautiful, bouncy ponytail to go with their matching windbreaker jackets and safety vests.  Later on Sunday, the royal couple toast it up (and debunked those baby No. 2 rumors) while visiting Amisfield Winery in Queenstown, New Zealand. Kate looked like she was living her best life wearing a navy Zara blazer, blue gingham button-down shirt, jeans and wedges.

Their versatility means we can pull them off in the work environment, or on a weekend whilst running errands and pretending like we just took a Pilates class.  However, as much as we love yoga pants, sweatpants reside in an entirely different category. Nothing can replace your favorite pair -- or pairs -- of sweatpants, and they're probably ridden with holes, dirt and/or obnoxiously printed with college sorority slogans up the sides or on the butt.  But the relationship you have with those sweats is a real one. Your stress levels significantly subside the moment you pull them on after work. They make you feel safe and comforted. That is why, no matter how many cute leggings or jeggings crowd your closet, one thing will always remain true: Sweatpants trump all. Here are 13 reasons why sweatpants are the sh*t.  1. Sweatpants don't hug our thighs. And we love anything that does NOT hug our thighs.   2. They're the \u200bbest pants to wear with our ugly, comfy granny panties on a Saturday night. 3. The baggy pant never goes out of style... never having been in style in the first place.  4. They can be nostalgic. We're all guilty of hoarding the college or sorority pair that we refuse to throw away.  5. There's never a day we DON'T want to wear them.  6. We can get away with washing them, like, never.  7. Do you really think we're going to throw on a pair of skinny jeans after the gym?   8. When we can't find ANYTHING to wear... \"I think I'll go with sweats.\"  9. We can pull them up real high above the waist after a rather large meal or a boozy brunch.  10. After a long day of work, putting them on makes us feel like a million bucks. 11. There is seriously no alternative when we're PMS-ing.  12. Sweatpants will (almost) never not fit.  13. Two words: Elastic. Waistband.  "

These are a few of the travel- and sports-related companies that accept Bitcoin:  Costa Rica Travel Market: After first hearing about Bitcoin, Monica McIntyre -- director of Costa Rica Travel Market, an online marketplace for Costa Rica hotel deals -- became \"fascinated,\" she said, \"by the idea of a payment method that would allow us to reduce transaction fees from an average of five percent to one percent.\" Coming from Latin American economies, where you get paid for credit card transactions up to 30 days later, where you pay up to seven percent for credit payment transactions and where the bureaucracy of banking obstructs business operations, Bitcoin seemed like the perfect alternative to the tilted payment systems institutionalized in the real world. CheapAir.com: The travel Website CheapAir.com is another business that has has found the Bitcoin concept promising. \"The idea [to begin using the currency] originated when a customer asked one of our travel advisers if we accept Bitcoin,\" said Jeff Klee, the CEO of CheapAir.com. \"I got wind of it and thought it sounded like an interesting idea. So I did some research to determine how feasible it would be, found out it would be very doable, and we decided to give it a try.\" Sacramento Kings: This year, this California-based basketball team became the first major professional sports franchise to accept the alternative currency. Ben Gumpert, senior vice president of marketing and strategy for the Sacramento Kings said: Bitcoin provides a convenient, cashless and frictionless transaction never before seen by NBA fans. It fits with our broader mission. From Google Glass to drones to Bitcoin, we're always looking for the most innovative and cutting-edge technologies to further improve our fans' experiences. Response from the Public The feedback from accepting Bitcoin, according to Klee, has been positive. \"We cannot be more thrilled with the results since we started accepting Bitcoin,\" he said.  On the technical side, things have worked really well. The integration was straightforward and there have been very few glitches -- no significant ones at all. From a customer standpoint, our announcement was very well received from the beginning, and we've gained quite a few new customers because of it. Gumpert reported that the response has been \"very positive\" to the Sacramento Kings's introduction of Bitcoin. \"We have seen purchases by our fans across a number of products,\" he said. \"We've also had a number of teams and several local businesses reach out to us asking for advice and telling us they're now considering Bitcoin.\" The Future of Bitcoin So will you soon be using alternative currency to make all your travel purchases? Probably not. In spite of his optimism, Klee predicted that it will take a while for some segments of the travel industry to adopt alternative payment options like Bitcoin. \"I think it will be a while before Bitcoin acceptance becomes widespread in the travel industry, particularly with the airlines,\" he said.  First of all, there is a lot of legacy technology in place that makes it difficult to do something like introduce a new form of payment. I also think the airlines are pretty conservative by nature and, in most cases, it's not in their DNA to move quickly on something like this. On the other hand, if Bitcoin use becomes more widespread, I think airlines stand to gain tremendously. In spite of recent headlines, Gumpert remains confident about the future of Bitcoin. \"Every new emerging market experiences setbacks,\" he said.  We don't believe one failed company signals the end to Bitcoin. We are confident in Bitpay, the Kings payment processor. As we do in all aspects of our business, we will continue to monitor and make adjustments as needed, to ensure the ultimate protection for our fans. McIntyre also believes this is the start of something big. \"Yes, [the collapse of] Mt. Gox was a hit to the image of Bitcoin, but only in the eyes of those who still do not understand the different dimensions and benefits of the system -- i.e. a currency, a payment system, a digital ledger,\" she said.  I think the incident will polarize a bit further the current positions: for those who like and understand Bitcoin, the incident might be seen as part of the growing curve of this innovative tool, something that will enable to correct and strengthen; for those who have been skeptical all along, the incident is a great 'I told you so.' But all in all, the incident will be forgotten soon, and Bitcoin will survive in a stronger form. Crypto-currencies are the future of digital payments. It might be Bitcoin or it might be called something else, but there is no stopping this, just like there was no stopping the new world the Internet opened up. "

      "text": "This article was written by Kate Furlong for Manilla.com. The thought of retirement can bring excitement and relief, but for many people, it can be unknown territory and can conjure up a tremendous amount of anxiety, stress and uncertainty, hindering their ability to properly prepare and actually look forward to the future. When you're working in your 20s, 30s, 40s and 50s, you have an idea of what you need to pay for: after-school activities for your kids, daily lunch out, groceries, your work wardrobe, vacation -- you get the idea. It's easy to plan and budget for these things in the present, because you know how much you have coming in and how much is going out. Here are some costs you should be thinking about as part of your retirement planning so that you don't find yourself ill prepared. Housing Housing is typically a cost that gets downsized in retirement, but that's not true for all people. Even if you do move to a smaller home or pay off your mortgage, you'll still be responsible for property taxes and/or homeowner fees (if you live in a condo or retirement community). Those could increase more quickly than you anticipate so you'll want to plan to have a cushion in your savings to cover them. Increased leisure activities Most people's retirement dream consists of spending more time with family and friends and doing things they never had the time to do when they were working, whether that be golfing, traveling, visiting grandchildren or meeting old friends over a meal or coffee. While this is no doubt a great time to be doing all of those things, these leisure pursuits also cost money and you might find yourself spending more on dining out and travel than you ever did while working. That said, be sure to factor in plenty of room in your budget so that you end up with both the time and the money to enjoy these activities. Long-term care and medical expenses Unfortunately, it can be very difficult to determine how much you might need to save for future medical expenses because it's impossible to predict longevity, health needs and government changes to medical programs. You may also want to purchase long-term care insurance, which can help cover expenses for home care or nursing services that are not covered by health insurance or Medicare and Medicaid. That said, not only is saving enough to cover these costs a good way to sleep more easily at night, it's also essential that you eat right and exercise in order to keep yourself as healthy as possible. Taxes Take the time to sit down and go through your retirement accounts, perhaps with a financial planner or accountant whom you trust, and figure out exactly what accounts you have, approximately how much money you'll need each year, and what your expected tax strategy is going to be. Depending on how you access the money in your accounts, as well as how your financial situation varies each year (e.g., deductions, house sales, Required Minimum Distributions), your tax picture could look very different in retirement. Because you want to make sure that you're keeping your hard-earned money working for you as much as you can, meeting with a tax expert to keep your taxes to a minimum is well worth it. Once you determine how your current expenses are going to change during your retirement years, you can start to understand how much you'll really need to save. Leverage online retirement calculators so that you can easily look at your goals and learn how much time it's going to take to meet them, says Linda Descano, President and CEO of Citi's Women & Co. She likes calculators from Choose to Save and AARP, but says that your bank likely offers one, too. Plus, now that you know what you're saving for, plan ahead. Both Descano and Kolcz agree that if you're employer offers a 401(k) or other employer-based retirement place, it's essential to contribute at least the minimum of what the company will match.

      "text": "We are in a dangerous time in the stock market. It's not a dangerous time because of a crisis or volatility. It's dangerous time because investors start to become overconfident. We have not had a substantial stock market correction in some time. One thing that always happens during these quiet stretches is that investors become lulled by good times. That sometimes gives a false sense of security. That can lead them to behave rather badly. I've seen plenty of investors get themselves in trouble during these quiet good times. I often compare it to the spring break college student dancing on the hotel roof. Sooner or later, something really bad will happen. Here are a few classics I've seen over my years: 1. Borrowing to invest.  I really don't know what people are thinking here. I've seen them borrow on credit cards and home equity lines. Most of the time they think that the trade will go their way and they can pay the money back. My advice don't ever do this. It never works out the way you think it will. 2. Not doing your homework.  Never, never, never invest in something you don't understand. If your advisor has made an investment for you, make sure you \"get it\" before you buy. You must do some due diligence on your own before investing. Some of the worst mistakes I've seen have come from buying and investment that people had no idea of what it was or how it worked. 4. Frequent trading.  This is truly a recipe for disaster. Trading frequently to try to pick up some gains. The vast majority of investors that have done this have blown up their accounts. Trading more does not equal more return. Do your homework, trade when necessary. If an investment has met your goal or something negative has taken place, that is good time to trade. In other words, have a defined strategy in place before you invest. 5. Taking too much risk.  Overconfidence has led many investors to become more aggressive. Their logic is that if I'm making this return, then if I'm more aggressive I'll make more. It's true, but if the market goes the other way, then you can lose more. Stick with your risk tolerance through good and bad markets. 6. Impatience.  Impatience will often lead us to use emotion rather than logic. Investing and emotion don't mix! Impatience will get an investor to trade too early, and therefore miss out on potential gains. In fact, impatience can cause you to lose more money from selling too early and not waiting on the investment to rebound. Patience is a virtue, and a necessity with investing. Stay calm. 7. Going it alone.  Of course, I'll say this one is a mistake! Seriously though, when times are good, investors get overconfident in their ability to manage their own money. Everybody is an expert when things are good. It all looks so simple. It doesn't help with all of the commercials, web sites and ads encouraging investors to drop their broker. Let that first large loss rack up, and the emotions start to kick in. Then the panic starts, and more bad decisions. A great financial advisor will prove his worth in bear markets. Calls and meetings that are all designed to reinforce your strategy and keep you on track. So those are the classic bad behaviors that I've seen. Yes, I believe this is a dangerous time in the market. When investors take more risk, become impatient with returns, and start talking about, or acting on, managing their own investments. Proper planning and investing is an art as well as a science. Don't give in to overconfidence. If you liked my post, you can get a free subscription right here.

That's why a new website might be our frizzy mess' new savior. \"How's Your Hair,\" created by a woman who gets us, a.k.a. designer and developer Gab White, is an app that makes it easier for you to style your hair in the morning. Depending on where you live, the website will generate a \"hair forecast\" for you based on environmental factors. So say you're in New York City and there's a chance of rain, you can style your hair accordingly. Although you can get a good idea of the day by going to Weather.com, \"How's Your Hair\" gives you witty commentary and the specific wind and humidity-to-hair ratio.  And if this wasn't already cool enough, you'll love the honesty and candor of the creator. On her personal site, White states:  \"As someone who has spent years of her life oscillating between embracing my curly hair to the point of abandoning my hair dryer versus beating my curly hair into submission with a high-power hair dryer and industrial strength flat iron -\u2013 a lot of my good hair days depend on the weather conditions. Sometimes you can peer out your window on a sunny June morning and expect nothing but the best of hair days, only to step outside and realize that the humidity is at 95 percent and all that work gone into heat styling your hair was wasted. You can literally watch your straightened locks shrivel up into frizzy corkscrews before your eyes, and if you didn\u2019t bring an emergency hair elastic, well then, you\u2019re shit out of luck.\" See!

Sometime around fifth grade, you probably found some old family photo albums and started leafing through them.

      "text": "He's the perfect Olfactory Ambassador. Meet Mario Tomas and you'll quickly learn he loves martinis. \"Jerry my partner and I are known for our martini glass collection and our martinis,\" says the budding perfumer during his debut at the Artisan Fragrance Salon.  This is the third year of the Salon in San Francisco, put on by TasteTV, the same people who bring you the International Chocolate Salon, held at the same time. Many of the perfumers were inspired to create wickedly delicious chocolate inspired scents. Olfactory Ambassador  Passionate, with an infectious smile and charming manner, Mario's new perfume line, Olfactory Ambassador, was an immediate hit with judges and fragrance lovers alike. I was one of the judges and I loved his packaging -- using mini martini shakers painted black as snifters for each of his three aromas. \"Ever since a kid I've always loved fragrances,\" he says. I love Mario's story even more. \"I remember my cousins and I sneaking into our uncle's room and while they were trying to look at the Playboys I was trying [my aunt's] fragrances.\" Those scent memories never left him, as evident in Corazon Blanco, a seductive and buttery white floral with base notes of cinnamon and decadent Mexican caramel. Mario, who grew up in Mexico, remembers his grandmother wearing white florals but also making cinnamon tea,\" he says. \"My mother loved caramel or cajeta and my mom likes gardenia and there's ylang ylang too.''  But in a twist there's another olfactory memory. I get a boozy character on the nose. Turns out that's tequila. Mario says, \"My cousin has a tequila distillery and I just remember that smell.\" Another scent in the trilogy is Lo Mejor de Mi #1, the best of me, which combines Mario's love of citrus, iris and musk. It is light and ethereal. Under the Olfactory Ambassador guise, Mario racked up the awards, placing first with judges in the Best Packaging and Best Ingredient Combinations, and second in Best New Product. He was even more successful in the People's Choice Awards, winning Top All-around Product Line and Best New Product, and sharing the lead for Best Aroma, Most Unique, Top Artisan Perfumer and Most Seductive Scent. En Voyage Shelley Waddington of En Voyage Perfumes debuted not one but three chocolate aromas. Shelly's a classical perfumer, but her creations are completely original. My personal favorite, perhaps IMHO the best scent in the show, is Indigo Vanilla.  I love the contrast of the sugared violet notes with the white chocolate, vanilla and amber. It's rich without being too sweet. A whiff of Indigo Vanilla will cure any chocolate craving. The other two perfumes are Captured in Amber and Caf\u00e9 Cacao, a mocha coffee lover's dream. Look for these scents to be available in May.  Shelly is also a judge and people's award favorite, winning Best Aroma and Most Seductive scent from the judges and from salon attendees, Top Artisan Perfumer, Best in Salon and shared Most Seductive Scent with Olfactory Ambassador. At last year's Salon her new fragrance Zelda won the Top Artisan Fragrance Award for its lusty, sensual vivacious character, inspired by none other than Zelda Fitzgerald. Shelly captures the spirit of the roaring 20's in a spritz. It's really a flamboyant Chypre.\" While Shelly's been making perfume for 14 years, she says, \"Zelda put En Voyage on the map.\" Meshaz Natural Perfumes  Even though lavender is the common note throughout the scents at Meshaz Natural Perfumes, this is not your grandmother's lavender. Mesha Munyan grows, harvests and distills her own lavender, using not one, but up to 14 varieties to create her portfolio of rather exotic scents, especially for lavender. Take Zauvage, a smoky, sultry, heavy fragrance. My inspiration for Zauvage began with a determination to push beyond my usual practice of coaxing the delicate, to one of engaging the bold, lusty and carnal. Ginger lily and exotic oud introduce this dark and sultry scent. Hearty Moroccan rose and jasmine sambac anchor a spicy accord of cardamon, black pepper and clove. Castoreum completes this tenacious floral animalic. The result is savagely unapologetic. In Abzinthe, the sweetness of the lavender flower interplays nicely with the anise note of Absinthe. I noticed more Absinthe-inspired fragrances than anything else at this year's salon. The tension of something a little dangerous (Absinthe) and something a little old fashioned (lavender) is very attractive. You'll notice the letter \"Z\" replaces the letter \"S\" in the names of her fragrances. \"I use the letter Z in my perfume names as a signature of completion after I have orchestrated a collection of naturally occurring scents,\" Mesha says. \"They together become a new thing by design and name.\" Mesha's lavender farm is in Sequim, Washington, where she's been cultivating lavender for more than 20 years. While she grows 14 varieties, she says there are actually hundreds of varietals of lavender angustifolias prized in perfumery. \"It has become a personal mission to let these variations be known and smelled,\" she says. This is Meshaz's second Fragrance Salon; Mesha debuted her line in Seattle last year. Meshaz was one of the Judges top picks for Most Unique and she was one of the winners in the People's Choice for Best Artisan Perfumer. Jolie Laide Another newcomer on the perfume scene is Jolie Laide, which translates from French as \"pretty ugly.\" Heather Kaufman, the nose behind Jolie Laide says, \"here's pretty things in perfume and kind of stinky things in perfume. Jolie Laide is also a French phrase that means unconventional beauty.\"  Heather first debuted her line at the Artisan Fragrance Salon in Seattle in May 2013. Her inspiration is French new wave films, with each of her four all natural botanical scents taking its name from a movie. \"They have an innovative way of telling a story,\" Heather says. \"I'm inspired by the ideas of that movement--their youthful spirit and intention of experimentation.\" My favorites are Baisers Vol\u00e9s, (stolen kisses) and Masculin F\u00e9minin.  Baisers Vol\u00e9s is a clean white floral inspired by gardenia, but there's no gardenia in it, as it is difficult to distill the scent from the flower. So Heather uses cuda, \"which is a big white spiky flower from India and it's got a horseradish-like top note but it's got a lovely floral underneath,\" she says. Pretty ugly.  For Masculin F\u00e9minin Heather's mix of \"smoky floral tobaacco with some tea notes with jasmine sambac mate and rooibos the smokiness is choa ral which is smoked vetiver.\"  Jolie Laide got the nod from the Judges for Best New Product and Most Unique (one of four). MIKMOI  This is the second Salon appearance for San Francisco perfumer Michael Coyle (aka Mik) and his line Mikmoi. He's inspired by the many cultures he's experienced through traveling. His website is in four languages, English, Japanese, French and Mandarin Chinese. \"What is interesting to me is when I'm researching where ingredients come from is what's the cultural background of those ingredients,\" Mik says. I'm a sucker for any fragrance with tuberose in it and Mikmoi's Ao is no exception. Mik says Ao is the Thai word for bay. \"This is a Thai ginger tuberose which is reminiscent of the beach bonfires on the beach in Thailand,\" he says. The sultry tuberose mixes with coconut juice and amyris for a tropical, exotic aromatic experience.  New for Mikmoi is a collection of solid scents that he calls portable cologne sticks. \"These are based on the five elements,\" Mik says. The names are in Japanese: Do for earth, Ki for wood, Ka for fire, Kin for metal and Sui for Water. I love how smoky Ka is, with Lapsang Souchong tea roasted over pine needles. The Judges voted Mikmoi the Top All-Around Product line and Mikmoi was also one of the People's Choice winners. Bruno Fazzolari Editions Bruno Fazzolari is a multi-talented artist. He's an accomplished and critically acclaimed painter and a new perfumer, creating bold canvases and bold fragrances. I love his concept of pairing his scents with his artwork. Bruno includes what he calls a \"trading card\" with each scent that has words and a specific image chose for the fragrance. His perfumes are also becoming critically acclaimed. At the Salon, the Judges awarded Bruno Fazzolari Editions the gold for Top Artisan Perfumer and Best in Salon; he shared gold with four other perfumers for Best Packaging.  Bruno takes risks in his painting and he takes them in crafting his perfumes. Take Lampblack, a scent inspired by the black carbon based pigment in India ink. Bruno created a series of paintings done in India ink. The particular work he chose to pair with the fragrance has dense swatches of lampblack ink almost obscuring other colors of blue, red, green and magenta.  The fragrance reflects this abstraction, with smoky inky aromas mingling with spice and fruit. It is startling and surprising and completely original, an alluring blend of sweetness and smoke.  Jimmy is just the opposite, a joyful, fresh violet floral with a hint of spice. Bruno says he was inspired by \"the work of the New York School poet, James Schuyler. References to violets and violet cologne appear frequently in his poems.\" He says he was reading a lot of Schuyler when he created the accompanying painting. Each painting paired with a particular fragrance \"reflects the spirit of the perfume.\" La Fleur by Livvy  I was totally charmed by Olivia \"Livvy\" Larson of La Fleur by Livvy, making her debut at the Artisan Fragrance Salon. Her natural fragrances represent phases of a woman's journey through life. With Fleur d'Aspiration its all about confidence in yourself and having your dreams come true. The scent itself was inspired by Livvy's memories of being in her grandmother's bedroom in India, where there was a frangipani tree outside the window. When the window was open the blossoms would float into the room and Olivia remembers that scent to this day. Fleur de Mystere is for creating a veil of mystery, with peach, sandalwood, ylang ylang, vanilla, geranium and rose. A Parisian Affair with lilac, champaca and and Cognac evoke a sweetly romantic evening in Paris.  I love that the packaging is very girlie, colorful bottles with atomizers and smaller blue heart-shaped bottles. You can tell there is a lot of heart and soul that Livvy puts into her perfumes, and she's off to a good start. The Judges voted La Fleur by Livvy one of two silver medal winners in the Best Ingredient Combinations category. For a complete list of all the Artisan Fragrance Salon Awards click here. "

      "text": "Why is it that some guys seem to have it and some guys don't? One guy in a t-shirt and jeans could seem to be dressed better (though more casual) than a guy in a suit and tie. You would think suit guy has several advantages, yet somehow t-shirt-and-jeans guy wins out. How does this happen? Basically, it comes down to fit. A guy in an oversized dress shirt and suit becomes larger than life in all the wrong ways. A shorter stature guy seems shorter than he is. An athletic guy looks out of shape, and a heavier guy seems like he's added a few pounds -- without any change to his diet. We can't change how tall or short we are any more than we can change the color of our eyes or our shoe size, but we can wear clothes that enhance our appearance and personal style, no matter what body type we are. So, the first rule about dressing well is understanding your body type and what works for you and what doesn't. There are a lot of great clothes out there, especially if you know what to look for, and what to avoid.  Guys on the Heavy Side - The Many Sides of Jonah Hill Some guys on the heavy side try to hide behind baggy clothes. It doesn't work. In fact, it can make for a sloppy appearance or make it look like you've actually gained some weight. I'm not suggesting you go out and get a pair of skinny jeans and a tight tank top, but do go out and get an outfit that gently drapes over your frame. If you have to squeeze into a pair of jeans, they don't fit. Get the next size. Pants that are too tight around the waist emphasize a heavy midsection and may make your belly protrude over your belt. Go with low-rise pants that cover at the hips, instead of ones that hit at the waist.  Darker colors generally have a slimming effect, but you don't always have to wear black. Try to create clean lines from top to bottom. It will also make you look a little taller. It works for Jonah Hill, a great actor and a guy who is developing a dapper style and a slimmer physique. By the way, he's 5'7\". If you're uncomfortable with your weight, hit the gym and your clothing choices will expand while your waistline will shrink. In the mean time, if you know what to wear, you can still look great.  Guys 5'9\" and Under - Dress Like Dave, Think Like Jon Though 5'8\" is the average height of men in this country, those around this height or below may be considered short. I'm one of them. I'm 5'6\", but I don't feel short and I don't dress short, and neither should you. But that's easier said than done. Most clothes are styled and sized for much taller people. In fact, if you go to a typical men's clothing designer web site, you'll see that the models are generally over six feet tall, generally about 6'2\"! Check it out -- a lot of sites these days tell you the height of the models and the size of the clothes they're wearing. My site, jadenlam.com, does the same thing, except our model is 5'6\". Most guys -- tall, short or average -- typically wear shirts, sweaters, trousers and suits at least a size too big. Pants bunch at the bottom or there's excessive fabric throughout the garment. The bottom of the pants should graze the top of the shoes and have just a little break. Pants needn't be tight, but they should definitely not be too wide for your legs. Wear modern flat fronts, with shallower front and back pockets and shorter inseams. For shirts, go for a shorter and narrower point collar, slimmer shoulders, higher armholes and a slightly tapered waist. If you wear the shirt untucked, make sure the shirttail falls about mid-zipper in the front and just below the pocket in the back. For sport jackets, two inches or less should separate your torso from the front of the jacket. The waist of the jacket should be tapered to create a longer look for the legs and a low stance on the jacket elongates the upper body.  Talent comes in all shapes and sizes. Who looks taller? Both comedic genius Jon Stewart and actor Dave Franco are 5'7\". Do their clothes make a difference? It's all in the fit. Tall and Athletic: LeBron is Today's Fashion MVP LeBron James has legendary style both on and off the court. He will go down as one of best who ever played the game of basketball. But when he first started in the pros, his game off the court was, well let's just say, oversized.  Fine tailoring, a tapered waist, shoulder seams that sit on top of the shoulder bone rather than beyond it, clean lines, narrower collar and a modern two-button suit have the potential to turns this basketball superstar into a style icon.  We know LeBron cares about fit. This is what he said about those new sleeved jerseys after a Miami Heat loss:  I'm not making excuses, but I'm not a big fan of the jerseys. Every time I shoot it feels like it's just pulling right up underneath my arm. I already don't have much room for error on my jump shot. It's definitely not a good thing.  No matter what body type you are, style and fit can make a difference whether you're trying to make a jump shot or enjoy an evening out on the town. Jaden Lam is a menswear designer.

      "text": "Last year, my son started his own business, called Alex Mill, a collection of clothing for men and boys. Fashion retail also happens to be his father's line of work, though the connection really does end there. While Alex certainly could have asked his father for help--and his father would have jumped in, happily--he instead chose to go it alone. Alex's last name was an advantage, of course, particularly in gaining quick publicity; most journalists couldn't help but mention Alex's well-known father. But while the two men never articulated it as such, I am confident both knew that if my husband joined the business in any meaningful way, Alex's chance of failure might decrease. But so, too, would the thrill that came with his success. When Alex first told us about his plans to launch the brand, I had a brief moment of fear. Fear of the unknown--totally natural, of course. Even though I've been in an entrepreneurial family my entire married life, I didn't realize until framed in the context of my son that fear of the unknown is the very thing all entrepreneurs must first embrace, then learn to brush aside. I suppose, for me, not being able to see that until one of my children was directly involved was like pressing your face too close to the book. It's hard to read the details.  I've since had the pleasure of watching, as a parent--removed, but still very close--the entrepreneurial spirit in action. And it's given me a much clearer view of what it takes to launch a business, and even what it means to be able to create something from nothing in that way. First--and this is clear in how animated Alex becomes, how his face literally glows when he talks about the business--an entrepreneurial venture has to come from somewhere deep inside, a place non-entrepreneurs either can't reach or quite possibly don't have. As Steve Jobs put it in his beautiful and memorable 2005 Stanford commencement speech: \"Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.\" While I knew Alex was following his heart and intuition when he dreamed up Alex Mill--and this was never a kid who readily shared emotions--and that his life has always been pointing him towards this career (and not only because of his father's vocation), I also knew that it took a while for Alex to realize it. But that realizing it, on his own, was essential. He'd considered a number of different careers before settling on fashion and retail, but it was that exploration that gave him the confidence and the education to embark on the Alex Mill adventure when he was ready. And as kids are wont to do, not a second before.   Not that he, or even I, are assured of his success. Almost 70 percent of start-up businesses survive two years, which isn't bad. But by year seven, that figure drops to 31 percent. The difference between success and failure, as my son is learning quickly, is part timing, part strategy and part luck. But as much as anything, success is a test of innate or absorbed qualities. It's a demanding mix of skills.  A year or so in, Alex still has a long road, and much work, ahead of him. It's not just a job, after all. Entrepreneurs are fully immersed in their business, in part because it's also an expression of who they are. Watching Alex truly agonize over how to make jeans that look like they've been washed and rewashed for a year, or chinos in exactly the right shade, or a website that works exactly the way he'd like it to, does not, then, worry me. Instead, it gives me a great feeling of contentment. He may appear to be stressed, but I know he's found himself, and is actually very happy.   Which will be another thing that proves to be an advantage, given that the most successful entrepreneurs are ferociously optimistic. \"Things will work out because I'll make them work out,\" is a sort of de facto motto. And the uncertainty that was, as a parent, my instinct to question? Entrepreneurs thrive on it. My son thrives on it. He'd rather forge a trail than follow one. This was another reason he chose to take less advantage of his father's connections and experience than he might have. At the same time, as his mother I can recognize certain qualities he's learned from his father and see how they've served him in business, particularly the art of dealing with people. It's been fascinating.  As in life, there are no guarantees in retail. Success is a fickle lover--clingingly devoted today, then moving out tomorrow without a word. Of course, from the point of view of Mom, I think Alex's business will not only make it but go on to become a global retail powerhouse. But as any entrepreneur knows--as I know--there are a million factors that can lead to an outcome like that. One thing I do know, for certain: On a number of levels, my son's entrepreneurialism has been nothing less than a wondrous thing to watch. "

It's no surprise then, that H&M chose her to be the face of their new Conscious and Conscious Exclusive campaign, which prides itself on creating sustainable and eco-friendly fashion, made from materials like 100 percent recycled cotton and hemp. Valletta has rallied not only for better materials, but for better working conditions as well. Her lifestyle brand Master & Muse \"bridges the gap between cutting-edge fashion and mindful manufacturing.\" The site features goods from various designers who are both stylish and environmentally/socially responsible. \"It's not just about environmental sustainability, we look at which companies are paying and treating their employees fairly. At the moment, this probably is just as important as the environmental issue,\" she said.  And launching a website isn't the only thing Valletta has done to work toward a better fashion industry. Through a series of shorts, titled \"Driving Fashion Forward,\" she aims to educate and shed light onto just how bad things really are. \"Workers are putting in 17 hour days and are getting paid 60 or even 30 cents a day, sometimes sleeping at the factory,\" she said, adding, \"It's important for people not only to know what's happening, but to realize that there are people who are trying to tackle these big problems.\" Of course, like many other conversations surrounding environmental issues, Valletta is aware that her notions are not new ones. \"We all know we cannot sustain the path we're on in any level of consumerism, we have to start looking at ourselves,\" but, she says, \"we can still do it with style. We don't need to wear hemp sacks, we can do it looking freakin' amazing.\" And she would know a thing or two about looking amazing, after all, she does have that whole supermodel thing going for her. She cites sun protection as her best beauty secret over the years, and calls highlighter \"one of those killer secrets that make everyone look good.\"  So how does she feel about how the industry has changed over the years? \"It's pretty amazing, actually. Now you can become your own brand through social media before you ever even get into a magazine. You do a little dance on YouTube and suddenly you're in Vogue,\" she laughed. When asked what advice she would give to young girls starting out in the indsutry, she stressed the importance of \"having interests other than modeling. It's only a finite amount of time. The more you develop as a person, the better you'll carry on afterward.\" Head over  to H&M to shop the Conscious and Conscious exclusive collections now.   "

Trust me when I say that traveling via motorcycle takes minimalism to a whole new level.  Very little makes the cut in a 40L backpack that carries both winter and summer clothes, riding gear, all manner of technology, and a year's supply of various things like contact lenses.  Though I used to be very into makeup, I've been steadily evolving into a beauty minimalist as I age. I tell myself that I'm purposely cultivating a look that is \"undone\" -- not too perfect or polished. The truth is, I am really lazy when it comes to this stuff.  That said, I'm not a bare-faced kind of gal either, much to the chagrin of certain motorcycle fanatics who think that wearing cosmetics is akin to apostasy. Makeup, no makeup, who cares? Do what makes you feel good.  For me, that's a little something most days, but not all. These minimalist tendencies made it very easy to prepare for life on the road, and my routine is virtually the same as it was at home (minus some special eye creams -- bring on the wrinkles, baby). Here's a look at what's in my makeup bag right now: Garnier BB Cream in Light/Medium. This was one of the first BB creams on the market, and I think it's the best one out there (disclosure: I have only tried drugstore brands -- yes, I am a cheapskate). This stuff serves as a lotion, sunscreen, and light makeup. 3-in-1 products like this are a dream come true for the minimalist, traveler or not. Note that if you are in the direct sun during hot parts of the day and/or extended periods of time, you should supplement with a real sunscreen. Maybelline Cover Stick Concealer for dark circles as well as the occasional blemish. Maybelline Cheeky Glow Blush. Thanks to my pale heritage (Irish, Dutch, German, and Belgian), I need a little pick-me up for my face. I bought this one in \u0110\u00e0 L\u1ea1t, Vietnam, after the blush I brought from home broke all over my bag. When it runs out (or more likely breaks in my bag again), I don't plan on replacing it -- I'll just use the red lip crayon I brought and rub a little of that into my cheeks.  Physician's Formula Solar Powder bronzer. In addition to its intended purpose (providing a little color and contour to the face), I use this as eyeshadow. Neutrogena SkinClearing Mineral Powder for my shiny T-zone and to set concealer where used. bareMinerals READY Eyeshadow duo in \"Epiphany\". This stuff is fabulous and more luxurious than anything else in my bag. I reserve this for special occasions/when I feel like getting dolled up. Maybelline Falsies Big Eyes mascara. Maybelline makes the best mascara ever. I have been using Big Eyes for a while, but I've tried almost every other mascara they make. They're all good. COVERGIRL LipPerfection Jumbo Gloss Balm (#245). This wonder stick provides a bit of color and moisture to pale lips, can be layered for a more dramatic red lip, and can also be rubbed into cheeks instead of powder blush. Makeup brushes: big fluffy brush for powder and bronzer, blush brush, eye shadow brush, and angled brush (used to both fill in brows and line eyes). What's in your travel makeup bag?

Kristen Wiig in J. Mendel  The funny girl got seriously edgy this week and we're loving every second of it! Kristen's leather high-neck bodice and color-blocked dress strikes the perfect balance between sophisticated and sexy. And that deep crimson lip completes this winning look.  Lupita Nyong'o in Giambattista Valli Couture   Lupita showed off her flower power while celebrating her May cover of Marie Claire. It's rare we see the stunning actress in something other than a bold colored frock, but this sweet and demure floral embroidered look proves that she can standout in anything.  Rashida Jones in Erdem  This is what you call preppy chic! Rashida turned her modest school girl-inspired dress into a fashion-forward feat by simply adding a pair of metallic pumps. A+ Mena Suvari in Sachin + Babi   It's pretty tricky for petite gals to rock anything tea length -- for risk of looking too frumpy -- so we were super surprised by how much we adored this ensemble on Mena. The pint-sized star's flouncy white crop top, eyelet skirt and thinly strapped sandals helped to keep the look light and airy.  Taylor Swift in J. Mendel  Crop top, high slit and cutouts -- oh my! Leave it to Taylor to combine all three trends and not look like a walking fashion faux pas. Well done, Ms. Swift!  "

A handful of our favorite celebrities simply ignored good sense and stepped out in some of the most bizarre outfits we've seen. However, there are definitely a few rules of thumb the ladies can takeaway from these debacles. Coco Rocha should avoid wearing stark white at all costs; Naya Rivera should keep her belly button covered on the red carpet; Kelly Rowland needs to dress her age; and Rumer Willis really needs to coverup. Finally, although we love that Maggie Gyllenhaal is a fashion risk taker, dressing like a huge wad of toilet paper is never a good look.  Check out our picks for worst-dressed of the week, and let us know if you agree. Naya Rivera   While we're definitely impressed by Naya's killer abs, there is nothing impressive about her outfit. Sadly, she looks like she just walked off the set of a horror flick in that slashed blouse and baggy capris. And her overly contoured makeup is pretty scary, too.  Maggie Gyllenhaal  Why, Maggie, why? This dress literally makes the actress look like she got teepeed. Enough said.  Coco Rocha   Coco's porcelain complexion goes from stunning to sickly in this white-on-white getup. The supermodel looks washed-out sans her bright pink pout and red hair.  Kelly Rowland  Kelly was spotted in Easter Sunday best ... circa 1986. All she was missing was a basket filled with eggs and some bunny ears. Furthermore, this outfit is way too boring and tame for one of the most beautiful stars on the planet. While her studded pumps say rockstar, that angora cardigan and floral fit-and-flare frock scream dowdy.  Rumer Willis  Rumer certainly has the figure to rock this revealing skin-tight dress, but that doesn't mean she should. We're tired of seeing the star look like she's working the corner -- if you know what we mean.  "

      "text": "We are all guilty of putting something off until tomorrow that can be done today. Even though the April 15 deadline for filing federal individual income tax returns is ingrained in our memory, many people still wait until the last minute to take action.  While the deadline is growing close, there's no need to panic. For most taxpayers, saving for retirement is one the most efficient ways to lower your taxes while simultaneously building a nest egg. Following the last minute tips below can help you not only boost your tax refund but also kick start your retirement savings.  Tip #1: Contribute to an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) One recommended way to reduce your tax bill is to open an individual retirement account or increase your contributions to an existing account. Contributing to an IRA not only helps raise your level of retirement readiness, but placing money into the account can also lower your total taxable income. The more you contribute to the IRA, the less of your income is subject to taxes, for those that qualify. While anyone can contribute to an IRA and enjoy tax-deferred growth, not everyone can deduct contributions. Eligibility depends on your marital status and whether you or your spouse has a retirement plan available at work. If you're single and don't have a retirement plan at work, your IRA contribution is entirely deductible. Similarly, married couples where neither spouse has access to a retirement plan get full deductions as well. The idea here is that if your IRA is your only retirement plan, the government wants to encourage you to use it fully. IRA contributions, which are tax deductible up to $5,500 ($6,500 if you're over 50), can be made until April 15 and often result in tax savings. Every dollar you contribute to a traditional IRA reduces your taxable income for that year.  If you do qualify for the deduction, remember to specify that the contribution is for the 2013 tax year. If you don't specify the year, you could end up contributing towards your 2014 IRA, which will decrease your tax bill a year from now but won't do anything for your current tax bill. Tip #2: Claim a Saver's Tax Credit This credit is often overlooked and seldom talked about. If you have an income up to $29,500 ($59,000 for married filing jointly), you can save for retirement and get a tax credit worth up to $1,000 for individuals and $2,000 for couples if you contributed to a qualifying retirement plan such as an IRA or 401(k).  Tip #3: Fund a Health Savings Account (HSA) As healthcare costs continue to spiral, funding a health savings account can be another way to lower your tax liability while saving for unexpected healthcare costs in retirement.  HSAs are tax-deductible savings plans that allow a taxpayer to save pre-tax dollars for future healthcare expenses. HSAs are paired with a high-deductible health plan and are one of the most tax-advantaged vehicles because contributions are tax-deductible and qualified distributions are tax-free. It is one of the few savings options that is completely tax-free. The annual contribution limit for 2013 is $3,250 ($4,250 if you're over 55) for self-only coverage and $6,450 for those with family coverage and can be made until April 15.  Save on Taxes and Grow your Savings All Year Around The biggest mistake made by taxpayers year in and year out is procrastination. Following the above tips will provide you with an immediate tax break to file your 2013 return, but it's also important to make sure you implement an effective tax strategy for the long-term. Consider the following tips to get a head start on lowering your 2014 tax bill. Tip #1: Enroll in your Workplace Retirement Plan For many taxpayers, contributing to a tax-advantaged savings account provides the greatest opportunity for tax savings. Contributing money to a workplace retirement plan, such as a 401(k), provides you with an immediate tax deduction and tax-deferred growth on savings. The money you contribute is tax-deferred from both federal and state income taxes, which means you don't pay taxes on the contributions until you withdraw the funds, typically at retirement age. For example, if you are in the 28 percent tax bracket and you invest $5,000 a year, that's $5,000 of your salary on which you are not paying taxes. This reduces your annual tax bill on that $5,000 by nearly one-third -- $1,400 ($5,000 x .28). Furthermore, contributions to the plan are deducted automatically from your paycheck, making the process seamless for you. By contributing even a small amount on a regular basis, you can works towards building retirement savings over the long-term and pay yourself instead of Uncle Sam.  Tip #2: Increase Retirement Plan Contributions Another way to lower your tax bill is to reduce your taxable income. If you're already enrolled in your retirement plan at work, consider increasing your contributions. Money contributed to the plan is not included in your taxable income. You can contribute up to $17,500 to your 401(k) or similar retirement savings plan in 2014. If you aren't going to reach that limit and can afford to, additional contributions will save you at tax time. If you are age 50 or older (or will be by the end of the calendar year) and your plan allows, take advantage of the \"catch-up\" provision. In addition to the $17,500 general deferral limit, you can contribute an additional $5,500 for a total of $23,000. This means if you are 50 years old this year and haven't started saving for retirement, you can contribute as much as $225,000 over the next ten years -- tax-deferred -- to your 401(k) plan. Investing in your retirement plan now allows you the potential to grow your retirement nest egg tax-free for tomorrow and get tax savings today.  Tip #3: Leverage Both Pre-tax and Post-tax Contributions If your plan allows for both traditional pre-tax and after-tax (Roth) contributions, evaluate which is a better option with your individual situation. You also have the option to split the deferral types. While pre-tax contributions allow you to contribute to the plan on a pre-tax basis, Roth contributions allow you the opportunity to grow these contributions tax-free. This is a valuable feature if you believe your taxes will be higher when you retire, since you will pay taxes on the contributions now based on a lower tax bracket and pay no taxes on the earning when you retire. Abraham Lincoln once said, \"You cannot escape the responsibility of tomorrow by evading it today.\" Following these tips can help you conquer the panic today of tomorrow's tax-filing responsibility while simultaneously building your nest egg and driving increased retirement readiness.

      "text": "For anyone living under a rock (or consciously unaware of celebrity gossip), power duo Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin recently announced their separation in a post titled \"Conscious Uncoupling\" on Gywneth's wildly popular blog, Goop. While the slightly... odd phrase created a social media storm and spurred a number of articles from The New York Times, Wall Street Journal and TIME (to name just a few!), as a makeup artist, I began to think how this thought process could apply to other realms -- particularly the makeup bag. There comes a time where I think everyone (even the most famous) needs to reevaluate their regime, and reassess what is -- and isn't -- working for them... Like Gywneth and Chris, sometimes it's just time to move on!   A glowing Gwyneth Paltrow-consciously uncoupled from bad beauty habits! Too Much of a Good Thing People are often surprised to hear me advise clients that less is more. I've adored the nude look for several seasons, but this guideline is more about evaluating what you really need vs. applying a full face of makeup because that's what you've worn for years (or even decades!). Women often cite mascara as their \"desert island\" beauty product, but apply it at the end of their makeup regime each day. Apply mascara first for immediate definition and you may find you don't need much else. Proper skincare and a top-notch primer can also work wonders toward perfecting skin so you can avoid heavy, mask-like foundation -- the ultimate offender in this department.    Barely-there makeup, flawless finish Getting Stuck in a Rut  Any happy relationship requires the acknowledgment that people grow and change over time, so why hold onto the same makeup long after the honeymoon is over? Nothing dates your overall look quite like a makeup statement that's been around since Miley Cyrus was Hannah Montana. Talk about a girl who's not afraid of change! Shocking transformations aside, the easiest way to keep your look fresh and age-appropriate is to visit a makeup counter each season for an update. If nothing else, your skincare and foundation absolutely need to adjust with the seasons and you just might find a new shade or formula to fall in love with. I've seen nude lip gloss devotees go mad for a bright lipstick when they give it a try. There's no cheating in makeup so you might as well experiment and have some fun!  A bold lip is an instant image upgrade Sticking with \"What Works\" Just like with dating, sticking with techniques you swore by in your teens or twenties can backfire down the road. Concealing your under eye area seems simple enough, but as any woman over 30 knows this area can become a minefield of fine lines and caked concealer with the wrong product or technique. I developed my Hollywood V method to create the bright-eyed, well-rested look flaunted by starlets of all ages on the red carpet. Apply concealer in a V-shape from the inner and outer corners of the each eye, meeting at the top of the cheekbone. Apply only what's left on your brush directly under the eye. This concentrates coverage where most discoloration occurs and prevents a heavy layer of concealer caking in fine lines.  Bright-eyed at the Alex Perry show during Australian Fashion Week The brilliance of makeup is that it can inject your life with a bit of fun and variety but requires little to no commitment whatsoever... unlike most relationships. I will, however, ask you to give a bold lip 12 minutes before consciously uncoupling it from your look. What may not be love at first sight can blossom into a beautiful relationship, or a signature look! "

      "text": "Whether you're out on a planned trip or happen to find yourself walking by a favorite store by chance, sometimes we all fall victim to shopping a great sale. That enticing, glorious \"additional 50 percent off sign\" in the window fills us with hope and fantasies of an updated wardrobe.  But it's not always all fun and games. As anyone who has ever attempted to take on a huge sale can tell you, it can be quite an emotional roller coaster. In fact, there are precisely 14 stages we experience on a shopping trip. Keep your hands and legs safely inside the shopping cart because this is going to be a bumpy ride.  1. Initial Attraction You see the store. The store sees you. Your heart skips a beat at words like \"final markdowns\" or \"additional percent off.\" 2. Hesitation  You know you don't really need anything, and you probably don't have room for anything new in your closet anyway, right? 3. Temptation  \"I wonder if that dress I saw online last week is on sale? It wouldn't hurt to look ...\" 4. Joy You're in! And there are racks on racks on racks of discounted clothing! Where to start? What to look at first? Maybe rethinking your outfit -- something stretchy would have been way more effective for this activity.  5. Thoughtfulness You get started on making your way through the goods. Nothing is TOO interesting, and your arm is starting to hurt. You're starting to wonder if you should just leave when ... 6. Shock The dress you saw online IS on sale! You know you have no choice but to try it on. But if you're already going to get in a dressing room and take your clothes off, you might as well pick up a few other things, too.  7. Overheating At this point, you have piled things so high on your arms you're starting to sweat. It's time to find a dressing room -- pronto. 8. Discouragement  You find yourself at the end of a treacherous line. And you're still sweating. You're about to leave the clothes right there on the table next to you, but something -- either the crippling desire of wanting to see how that dress looks on you or the guilt of knowing a sales associate is going to have to clean up that mess -- keeps you waiting.  9. Excitement Someone announces they are opening another dressing room upstairs! You debate whether or not the move is to run up there or let everyone else run (remember, you're already sweating). You decide to stay and watch as the line shrinks. Hooray! 10. Disappointment You finally get to the front of the line to realize you can only bring in seven things. But you have 10 things! You hesitate to leave the rest out there on the rack for all the other sale-crazed vultures to pick at. But you have no choice, and the salesperson has a kind face. So you do it.  10. Horror  You get into the dressing room and start to take your clothes off when it hits you -- you have to pee. HOW ARE YOU SUPPOSED TO TRY THINGS ON WHEN YOU HAVE TO PEE? 11. Stamina You start going through the pile as quickly as possible. Hangers fly, shirts are inside out. You mean business. And you still have to pee.  12. Thoughtfulness (2)  You stare at all the things that you've tried on. You calculate how much everything would cost and then stop to think -- do you really need another black shirt? No, you do not. 13. Accomplishment  You leave the room with your selections in hand and make your way to the register and/ or bathroom, whichever comes first.  14. Defeat*  You get to the cashier and realize the line to pay is even longer than the line was to try the clothes on. This time, all regard for others has escaped you and you drop everything on the floor, making a beeline for the door. You can buy this stuff online when you get home anyway. *Admittedly Step 14 varies on just how badly you want whatever it is you end up finding. But if you make it through all of that, you need to go buy yourself an ice cream. You deserve it.   "

      "text": "By Paula Pant April 15 is fast-approaching, and if you're like many people, chances are your tax prep is somewhere on the spectrum between mild disarray to frantic, panicked scrambling. There's just something about doing our taxes that makes many of us revert to slacker college student mode, waiting till the last minute to throw together that report we've known about for months. But there is hope. There are plenty of last-minute tax tips that can still save you a hunk of change, even in the 11th hour. So put down that shoebox of receipts, take a deep breath, and read on: File Even If You Can't Pay Don't fall into the trap of thinking that if you can't pay your taxes, you may as well not file. You're going to wind up paying a penalty either way, but it will be much bigger if you don't file at all. Consider this: The penalty for failing to pay your taxes is 0.5 percent of whatever you owe. So, if you owe $5,000, you'll be charged $25/month. In contrast, if you don't file at all, you'll be charged a whopping 5 percent of your outstanding tax bill. Instead of $25/month, you'll be looking at a penalty of $250/month for a $5,000 tax bill. Which would you prefer? Don't Neglect to Pay If You're Getting an Extension Are you filing for a tax extension? You still need to mail the IRS a check. Filing for an extension does not exempt you from having to pay by the April 15 deadline; it just extends your deadline for turning in your tax return by six months. If you don't pay, you're still liable for that 0.5 percent penalty. How do you pay if you don't know exactly how much you'll owe? Give your best estimate. There are a variety of free tax estimator tools online that can help you get a basic idea of what you'll owe. You may still be charged interest and penalties for the remaining balance if you wind up making an underpayment, but it will be considerably less than if you didn't make a good-faith payment at all. (If you can afford it, make an overpayment, just to ensure that you won't pay a penalty.) Maximize Your Deductions and Credits One of the biggest mistakes taxpayers make is failing to take full advantage of every deduction and credit that's available to them. Yes, it will take you a little more time, but if you skip this step, you're leaving money on the table.  Whether you're an individual, a small business owner or anything in between, chances are you'll qualify for some type of deduction. Here are some of popular examples: \u2022 Are you a homeowner? Your mortgage interest is tax-deductible. \u2022 Do you have a child under age 13? Some childcare expenses are tax-deductible, at $3,000 per qualifying individual, up to a maximum of $6,000. \u2022 Did you pay for college for either yourself or your child? If your income falls under certain guidelines (modified adjusted gross income of $80,000 for single filers and $160,000 for joint filers), you may be eligible for a tax credit. \u2022 Are you a lower-income individual or couple? You may be eligible for an additional \"Saver's Credit\" of $1,000 (individual) or $2,000 (couple) for contributing to your own retirement account. Maximizing your deductions is a great idea for all taxpayers. But the qualifying activity -- paying mortgage interest, paying for childcare -- had to happen last year.  In other words, this information can help you take advantage of the deductions and credits that you already qualify to receive. But it can't necessarily help you qualify for more. In the next three sections, let's look at steps you can take today to retroactively reduce your tax bill. Contribute to a Traditional IRA Most tax deduction strategies, unfortunately, require you to take action before the end of the calendar year, so you may too late to knock a chunk off your 2013 tax bill. But you're not totally out of luck. Even if you're up against the wire, you can still squeeze some extra savings from your tax return by contributing to a traditional IRA. If you do so on or before April 15, and specify that your contribution is a prior-year contribution, you could be eligible to deduct as much as $5,500 from your 2013 tax return. (Up to $6,500 if you're over 50.) Extra money in your IRA and a tax deduction? I call that a win-win. Contribute to a Health Savings Account If you have high-deductible health insurance (a $1,200+ deductible for single coverage or $2,400+ for family), you can snag additional savings by contributing to your health savings account, or HSA.  The maximum contribution for tax year 2013 is $3,250 for individual coverage and $6,450 for family coverage (with an extra $1,000 in \"catch-up\" contributions if you're 55 or older). And your deadline for making these contributions is April 15, 2014. In other words: If you can move this money into your HSA account before this years' tax-filing deadline, you can enjoy an additional tax deduction. Maximize Your 401k Likewise, you can make retroactive contributions to your 401k account that apply towards last years' tax bill. Move money into your 401k and earmark this as a \"previous year contribution.\" Like the HSA and Traditional IRA, your deadline for making 2013 contributions is April 15, 2014. Double-Check Your Return One final tip: Don't let your last-minute rush lead you to make costly mistakes. Three of the most common mistakes taxpayers make are math errors, incorrect Social Security Numbers and neglecting to sign and date their return.  Use tax software or hire a CPA (or, at the very least, double-check your math with a calculator). Proofread everything to make sure you didn't make any typos or transpose any numbers. And make sure the signature and date are complete before you hit \"send\" or put that envelope in the mail. Don't delay your refund by carelessness. Get a Head Start for Next Year The IRS estimates that 20-25 percent of all taxpayers wait until the last two weeks to file their taxes. If this describes you, you're still in luck.  Follow the above tips to maximize your savings. Then do yourself a favor and make a date with yourself to start your 2014 return much, much earlier. You'll thank yourself for it. "

      "text": "If you are like a lot of people, balancing the financial needs of today with the financial needs of tomorrow is a constant challenge. It can be really hard to protect our future self from our current self. Like most things, the earlier we develop good habits around managing money for those future needs, the better. I have asked many retirees the question -- \"If you could go back thirty years and give yourself advice about retirement, what would you say?\" To no surprise, one of the most popular answers is, \"I wish I would have started saving earlier.\" To avoid giving the same response when you retire, here are five habits that everyone can develop before turning 25. 1. Keep track of everything in one place. Call it a budget. Call it a plan. Use Quicken, sign up for Mint.com, create a spreadsheet or keep it in a special notebook. Whatever it is, track your income, assets and debts in one place. Even if you don't like what it is telling you, ignorance is not bliss in this situation. Your life clock keeps ticking, making this harder the longer you put it off. 2. Take advantage of any/all savings plans offered at work. If your employer offers a 401(k), 403(b), stock purchase plan or other savings plan, take advantage of it. Many plans offer an employer match (a.k.a. -- free money). Some enable you to purchase company stock at a discount.  3. Open an IRA. These accounts, whether traditional or Roth, offer a positive tax benefit. If you put money in an IRA, you create the opportunity for time and compounding to do their thing.  4. Make it automatic. For many of us, the key is to find those, \"Set it and forget it strategies\" that enable us to make current sacrifices that we don't see or feel and then let inertia take over. Payroll deduct contributions to a 401(k) are a good example of this. You could also sign up for a mutual fund or company stock program that allows you to make small investments over time, that come right out of your checking account.  5. Actively manage your debt. Chances are you have a lot of debt. It may feel like so much debt you don't even like to think about it. Whether home mortgage debt, student loan debt, or credit card debt, many of us spend little time thinking about it. With interest rates being low and certain debt having a better tax profile than others, a lot can be gained by actively managing debt. Whether that means paying it off a little quicker, using less, consolidating, or refinancing, there are often many things you can do to optimize your debt. Denial and avoidance is the worst approach. Life moves fast. Savings and debts can grow fast as well. The earlier you begin saving money and the earlier you begin managing debt, the more likely you will be able to react to the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead, as well as reaching the ultimate goal -- a safe and secure retirement (without regret over not saving sooner).

      "text": "So the worst has happened after calculating your tax return: you owe money in taxes this year. Is there a way to make lemonade out of the grand experience of forking over a big chunk of cash? How about racking up some rewards points or travel miles on one of those rewards credit cards? Well, it isn't quite that simple. At MyBankTracker.com, we love credit card mileage and other rewards points, but we also believe that it doesn't make any sense to spend a lot of money for too little reward. The good news is that you can pay a tax bill with a credit card, but the downside is that the associated fees can be substantial. None of what follows is a solid replacement for meeting with a qualified tax planner with ample experience in managing debt and personal finances, but the information will help you ask better questions along the quest to save money and get more out of the finance tools you have. Payment handling services The IRS website lists the percentage charged by third-party services that allow you to pay by debit or credit card, whether you e-file or pay by mail. Rates are as follows: Do the math, but weight the goals Since it costs money to pay with a credit card, it's important to do the math to see if the gain in rewards points or mileage bonuses offsets those charges. However, there are other reasons that are perhaps less tangible in terms of dollars that might make paying taxes on the rewards card a smart idea. Will the amount paid in taxes and fees push you over a spending threshold and into a higher rewards bracket? Will the extra spending bump you into any other bonus category? If so, then the associated perks might be worth spending a few extra dollars. All of these factors depend on the terms of your card, so it is important to look at the terms closely. Now for another caveat. You need to know how the bank that issues your credit card will treat the expenditure. Will it be treated like any other purchase, or will it fall into the category of a cash advance? Cash advance terms are usually more costly in the long term, because the interest is usually higher, and the non-cash advance principle needs to be paid off before your monthly payments are applied to the cash advance balance. This means you are paying the higher interest rate for longer on a cash advance. Other associated fees may also be incurred. Credit card convenience checks Credit card convenience checks might be an option to pay your taxes, earn points, and skip the fees paid to third-party credit card processing services, but may come with the same additional fees and balance principle problems as cash advances, or worse. Know the terms before signing on the dotted line as every bank manages this differently for different cards and accounts. Read your user agreement carefully and call the bank to clarify. Ask for the details in writing in case you don't have the most up-to-date terms. Know your payment habits None of what has been written above takes credit card interest rates into account, and assumes the debt incurred from the tax payment will be paid off in full during the billing cycle to avoid accruing interest. If the debt can't be paid off right away and the interest is high, considering other options might be a good idea. Perks aren't worth much if the cost exceeds their value.

According to a recent Harris poll conducted on behalf of the National Foundation for Credit Counseling, more people learn about personal finance at home than they do online, from financial professionals or in school. While family plays an important role in financial education, clearly there are some gaps in that education. The NFCC survey found that 71 percent of consumers admit to having financial worries. Thirty-two percent are saving nothing for retirement, and 34 percent carry credit card debt over from month to month. Some of those worries and mistakes could be avoided with better communication with family, friends and colleagues about financial knowledge. Toward that end, here are six conversations you should have about money: "

My clients are finally shedding their winter layers, in both their wardrobes and their hair.  Spring is kind to every hair type: not as dulling and dry as winter, and not as humid and frizz-inducing as summer. So it is the perfect time to try something new and different, without extreme weather affecting the outcome or your enjoyment of the style.  If you find yourself in need of spring hair inspiration, keep these three ideas in mind:  Bring it Up!  Your ends have been abused by winter hats, scarves, heaters, wind -- I could go on and on. The best spring refresher is not another trim, but a true hair cut with redefined lines and clean layers. Hair grows faster in spring and summer, so this is the best time of year to get the job done.  Brighten Up!  Dark tones are for the long months of hibernation. It's time to bring back life and light to your color. Start with softly Balayaged face framing pieces first (subtle hair painting). Then work your way lighter and brighter until you feel as sunny on the inside as it is outside. Or if you're really in the mood for a change, opt for shimmering shades of coppers and reds! Braid it Up!  It's not warm enough yet to forgo the blow dry completely. But spring hair should also be more casual and fun than fully styled, blown out winter hair. So take advantage of the Braid's continued popularity. Rough dry with the blow drier until your hair is mostly dry before wrapping it into a low braided bun with a side part -- a timeless and chic choice. As an added bonus, you'll have effortless waves for second day hair.   My final tip: get outside and enjoy the sunshine! We have certainly waited long enough for it!  "

Our favorite couple's trip through New Zealand and Australia rolled on Wednesday, and with it came yet another day of amazing style from Kate Middleton.

The duke and duchess headed to the south island of New Zealand to attend a memorial service in honor of the 100th anniversary of the outbreak of WWI. For the occasion, Kate paired her perfectly fitted coat with navy pumps and those famous earrings. But what we love most of all is that fierce ponytail, a welcome surprise look we're not used to seeing on her. Then, later on that evening at a state reception, she ditched the updo to show off those long locks in a bejeweled Jenny Packham dress (of course), sipped what looks like either white wine or champagne, and toasted the unveiling of a painting of Queen Elizabeth II.

Everything in your 10-item wardrobe should \"go\" with everything else.  Don't be intimidated by the number 10. If that is too low for you, keep a manageable number of core items that work for your lifestyle. The point of the capsule wardrobe is to help liberate you from a cluttered wardrobe of pieces that you never wear and that don't express your true style. The less clothing you have to pick from each morning as you are getting dressed, the easier it is to actually choose an outfit! And if you plan it carefully, you are more likely to wear your best on a daily basis instead of wandering around in exercise clothes all day long because you couldn't decide on what to wear. This spring I have 11 core items (proving that you don't have to take the number 10 literally). I have five dresses, four blouses and two pairs of jeans (one white, one in light denim). As a working, stay-at-home mom of two small children, this washable wardrobe is wearable and chic and works for me.  Check out my video to see how the core pieces work in conjunction with each other and how they also pair beautifully with the extras. Then have fun compiling your own ten-item wardrobe for spring.

      "text": "No one enjoys doing taxes, which probably explains why so many of us leave it to the last. Possible. Moment. With Tax Day fast approaching (next week!), millions of Americans are no doubt scrambling to track down receipts, bank statements and other important documents in a bid to meet the April 15 filing deadline. But the more you rush, tax pros say, the more you're likely to make mistakes that can cost you in the form of penalties, a delay in getting your refund and even a higher risk of an audit. So, if procrastination has gotten the better of you this year, don't worry, you're not alone. Here are a few last-minute mistakes to avoid to keep your return error-free. 1. Overlooking Income The IRS requires you to claim all income made in 2013, regardless of whether or not you received a W-2 or 1099 from an employer. Failing to disclose income is a common issue for last-minute filers -- and an oversight the IRS is keen to uncover. \"Maybe someone did one little freelance job back in February and kind of forgot about it -- and forgot to include it on their tax return,\" says Lindsey Buchholz, principal analyst with H&R Block's Tax Institute. \"Those are the kind of things that the IRS can catch pretty easily.\" And once the IRS realizes you owe more, you'll be on the hook for the extra tax, plus penalties and interest. So even if you only worked a side job for a day, the income you received is still taxable, and you must claim it on your return. 2. Messing Up the Math If you're pressed for time, put away the pencil and paper. E-filing is easier, faster and more secure than processing your returns via snail mail -- and you'll avoid the long line at the post office come April 15. Another upside to e-filed returns: You can eliminate mistakes, like \"not understanding how to apply a tax table or not doing the math correctly,\" says Buchholz, adding that online software will generally catch any errors you've made along the way. The good news is that the IRS offers free tax software to people whose incomes are less than $58,000, and free fillable tax forms for those who earn more. Companies like H&R Block and TurboTax also offer free simplified returns online. That said, if you still prefer to file on paper, take the time to run your figures through a software program to make sure your final tallies are correct. RELATED: A CPA Spills: The 10 Biggest Tax Mistakes That I See 3. Forgetting to Double-Check Numbers and Signatures One of the most common tax mistakes, according to the IRS, is an incorrect Social Security number, so make it a point to check that you haven't accidentally transposed the digits. And if you've opted for a direct deposit refund, you should also make sure that your bank account information is accurate. Finally, don't forget to sign and date the return -- and have your spouse do the same if you are filing jointly. An unsigned return is like an unsigned check in the eyes of the IRS: It's invalid. 4. Missing Out on Deductions and Credits When you're rushing to file, you are more likely to overlook credits and deductions that could save you hundreds -- even thousands -- of dollars on your tax bill. According to H&R Block, one in five filers who prepare their own taxes disregard benefits, losing out on an average of $460 in either credits or deductions. \"Education credits, in particular, are missed quite often,\" Buchholz says. \"There are several different kinds of benefits, and it can be hard to figure out which one you qualify for, and which benefits you the most. I think some people get stressed-out about it, and decide not to do it.\" Child care benefits are also often misunderstood, says Koreen Jervis, an enrolled tax agent with Korj\u00e9 Tax Professionals in New York City. \"People hear child care and they think day care,\" she says. \"But they forget that when their kids do summer programs, that's also a child care expense,\" and therefore are eligible for a credit. Tax procrastinators aren't just subject to leaving money on the table either. They also run the risk of double-dipping on deductions in their rush to file -- and running afoul of the IRS. \"People often forget that if they contribute to a child care flex spending account, they can't also get the child care credit,\" Jervis says. \"A lot of people do that, and then get letters from the IRS.\" RELATED: 11 Kid-Centric Tax Breaks Every Parent Should Know About 5. Failing to Itemize Deductions For many people, taking the standard deduction -- $12,200 for couples or $6,100 for single filers -- may seem like the simplest and easiest route when doing taxes, especially if they're pressed for time. But itemizing your deductions can sometimes save you a bundle. If you've had large, uninsured medical expenses, made sizable charitable contributions or paid a significant amount of interest or taxes on a home in the past year, itemizing may be worth your while. Not sure if itemizing is right for you? Take this quiz to find out. 6. Not Asking for More Time It's far better to opt for an extension than to file a tax return full of mistakes. \"If it's last-minute, your best bet is to file an extension,\" Jervis says. \"It will give you time to really look at your options and make sure you aren't leaving valuable deductions out there or making errors that can cost you later.\" Form 4868 -- it can be filed by mail or online--gives filers an automatic six-month extension on their returns. 7. Misunderstanding Extension Rules That said, just because you file an extension doesn't mean that you don't have to send in a check on April 15 if you owe taxes. In fact, it's one of the most common mistakes Jervis encounters. \"An extension is an extension on the return -- not on the payment,\" she says. So even if you push off filing your return until October, \"you need to be prepared to estimate your income, and pay whatever you may owe\" come April 15, adds Buchholz. \"Otherwise, you will get penalties and fees.\" RELATED: What to Do if You Can't File Your Taxes on Time Bottom line: If you are feeling truly overwhelmed because you've waited until the eleventh hour to do your taxes, ask for an extension -- and then ask for help. If you don't understand your particular situation and what you can claim, even the best tax software won't be much help. When in doubt, Jervis says, \"find a good preparer.\" This story originally appeared on LearnVest.

      "text": "Lately I have been having more and more conversations about changing portfolios! \"Change them how?\" you ask. By increasing the risk of the portfolio. In the 20-plus years that I've been advising clients, I've seen it during every bull market. Investors' risk tolerance gets higher. They just get comfortable with it, like it will last forever. On the flip side, in bear markets, everyone's risk tolerance goes down. I've said time and time again that you need to pick an overall risk tolerance for both good and bad markets and stick with it. Don't change it with every movement of the markets. Sometimes investors will confuse recent successes and tend to be more aggressive. It can give you a false sense of investment prowess. Then things turn south, and you pay for it. So how does a poor investor figure out their risk tolerance? With the help of an advisor, of course. Start working with a qualified financial advisor on this very important component of investing. Here are some questions that an advisor might ask you about your risk tolerance: 1. What is your time frame? This is probably the most important question on the list. Risk is relevant to time frame. If you have decades to invest, then it's highly likely that you can weather the volatility of the markets and be more aggressive. However, if your time frame is short, you have less time to make up declines that will eventually take place. 2. Would you choose this risk tolerance if the markets were down several thousand points? I think this question is a real test of whether you would approach your risk tolerance the same way in a declining market. If so, go for it. If not, then think twice about being more aggressive. 3. How do you react to volatility? When you read the news that the market soars or dive bombs, how do you react? Do you get upset, check your accounts and pace the floors? Or do you blow it off and accept the fact that volatility is all a part of it? Think about this. What do you do with existing investments? Do you change them and move out of stocks, or do you leave them alone or even invest more? Your answers will determine what your risk tolerance really is. Determining risk tolerance is a true art. It's subjective and different for everyone. It's where a good financial advisor can earn his keep. Many financial advisors use a tool called a risk tolerance questionnaire. It has questions that try to determine your level of risk. I've seen quite a few risk tolerance questionnaires over the years. Some are terrible, and some are very accurate. Use a questionnaire, but back it up with a good advisor and the answers to the questions above. Risk tolerance really is that important. It will determine your long-term happiness during bull and bear markets.

      "text": "There is no shortage of makeup advice these days. Everywhere you turn, self-proclaimed makeup experts are passing out advice on all the do's and don'ts of makeup application. In reality, there are tons of makeup \"tips\" out there without any validation behind them. Below are some of the most common makeup myths that many people have fallen victim to.  1) Darker foundations make you look tan: In reality, choosing a foundation that is too dark for your skin tone only makes you look like you chose the wrong foundation. For the best results always match your foundation to your natural skin color.  2) Makeup causes breakouts: False. Bad hygiene causes breakouts. Make sure your face is clean before applying makeup and never sleep with it on. Proper skin care is the foundation to flawless makeup application. 3) Pump your mascara for more product: This practice does not work and it is one of the worst makeup habits I have seen women have. Instead of pumping the mascara wand, try to twist it out of the tube. Pumping your mascara will introduce air into the tube, forcing in bacteria and causing it to become trapped. The inside of your mascara tube will become the perfect habitat for bacteria to survive and reproduce. This habit can lead to some nasty eye infections and can also cause the mascara to dry out and break down faster than it normally would. In order to practice safe mascara habits make sure you are replacing your mascara every 30 days. 4) Expensive cosmetics are better than inexpensive ones: The truth is, there are good and bad products in all price ranges. It really doesn't mean much to buy a $30 tube of lip-gloss. Most makeup stores allow you to test products before purchasing, and you should take advantage of this option whenever given the opportunity. Don't just look at the price tag and assume you are getting what you pay for.  5) Apply your concealer before your foundation: The opposite is actually true. By applying your foundation first you will already cover up most of your blemish areas. Concealer is for the stubborn areas that cannot be covered with foundation. You will find that you save a lot of time in your makeup application by applying your concealer after your foundation.  6) There is no need to clean your brushes if you are only using them on your own face: This falls into the category of proper hygiene. Brushes are a breeding ground for bacteria. You should be washing your brushes at least once a week. I don't use any cleaning products on my brushes that I wouldn't use to wash my own hair. Brushes are expensive and are certainly an investment. Proper brush care will also allow them to last for a long time. I have brushes that still look new after 15 years of using them. 7) Use an eyebrow pencil the exact color of your eyebrows: Matching your eyebrow color and filling them in will cause them to look harsh. Using a shade or two lighter than your eyebrow color will allow them to look more natural when you fill them in.  8) Waterproof mascara is better than regular mascara: This is wrong for so many reasons. Unless you are going to an event where you expect to be crying your eyes out, or dunking your entire head underwater, stay away from waterproof mascara. The main reason for this is that waterproof mascara is much more difficult to wash out than regular mascara. The actual actions of what it takes to properly remove it will cause you to pull out your eyelashes in the process. Every woman craves long, luxurious, thick lashes and can absolutely achieve that without waterproof mascara. In addition to this, do not sleep with your mascara on. This can lead to your eyelashes becoming brittle and prone to breakage. It can also cause some pretty gross infections in your eyes. "

The website announced Wednesday morning that they have hired longtime makeup artist and founder of Bobbi Brown Cosmetics, Bobbi Brown as editor-in-chief of Yahoo Beauty, Women's Wear Daily reports. It has already been quite a year for Brown, whose latest book,  Everything Eyes: Professional Techniques, Essential Tools, Gorgeous Makeup Looks,\" also hit shelves this month.  The site will feature product reviews, videos and original content from Brown herself. The 56-year-old beauty mogul is widely regarded for her natural-looking aesthetic, and she is sure to bring her keen sense of social media as well as her ability to empower women with her to Yahoo. But don't think that the new site will be filled with unattainable beauty and lifestyle tips. Brown has made it clear that she has much bigger and realer plans: Beauty isn\u2019t about looking perfect; it\u2019s about celebrating your individuality. I already create a lot of content with social media, but my interest in beauty isn\u2019t just about cosmetics. That\u2019s what excited me about this opportunity. Beauty for me is lifestyle, empowerment, what you eat -- so many things. A website that celebrates individuality, has a positive message for women AND talks about food? Now that's something we can get on board with.   "

The New York Post's Page Six reports Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's buzzed-about April 2014 Vogue issue is slated to sell between 300,000 and 400,000 copies. It may even surpass sales of 2013 issues featuring Beyonce and Obama that sold about 355,000 and 300,000 copies, respectively.  A Cond\u00e9 Nast representative was not immediately available for further comment to The Huffington Post, but a rep told Page Six:  [We] never comment on sales figures.  One person who might not be surprised by the issue's huge sales is West himself, who previously told Ryan Seacrest that his fianc\u00e9e is the perfect Vogue cover girl.  \"There's no way Kim Kardashian shouldn't be on the cover of Vogue,\" he said in October. \"She's like the most intriguing woman right now ... No one is looking at what [President Barack] Obama is wearing. Michelle Obama can't Instagram a [bathing suit] pic like what my girl Instagrammed the other day.\" The Kimye Vogue spread featuring baby North West was certainly one of the most talked about in some time. Despite some backlash over how a reality star could be featured front and center on the fashion bible, Anna Wintour defended her choice.  \"Part of the pleasure of editing Vogue, one that lies in a long tradition of this magazine, is being able to feature those who define the culture at any given moment, who stir things up, whose presence in the world shapes the way it looks and influences the way we see it,\" Wintour wrote in her editor's letter. \"I think we can all agree on the fact that that role is currently being played by Kim and Kanye to a T.

As Prince George tags along with his parents for their three-week tour of New Zealand and Australia, he's already stunned us with his amazing baby travel style. While visiting the Plunkett's Parent's Group at Government House in Wellington earlier today, Prince George and Kate Middleton sported outfits that made them stand out in a crowd of doting mothers and their babies.  The Duchess of Cambridge looked relaxed yet regal in a black and white Tory Burch Resort 2014 dress. The open knit short-sleeve dress paired with black Prada pumps was a smart choice, considering she had to do a lot of moving around with Prince George attached at her hip. Kate's bouncy, beautiful blowout completed the look.  Meanwhile, Prince George was playdate-ready in Rachel Riley navy overalls with a cute little ship design stitched on front.

Well, some might not agree. Though Kim Kardashian is arguably one of the biggest stars in Hollywood right now, many don't think she is deserving of some of the major magazine covers she has landed over the past few years. Between her stints on the cover of Allure, Glamour, Harper's Bazaar and most recently, Vogue, it's no secret that Kim's face is literally everywhere. And so is the backlash. So much so that Anna Wintour felt the need to release a statement once the Kimye cover hit the Internet. Wintour explained, \"As for the cover, my opinion is that it is both charming and touching, and it was, I should add, entirely our idea to do it; you may have read that Kanye begged me to put his fiancee on Vogue's cover. He did nothing of the sort.\" Stefano Tonchi, editor-in-chief of W magazine put Kim on the cover for his November 2010 issue. When asked why he chose Kim for W (a decidedly conceptual, high-fashion publication), he said: We thought that Kim provided a vehicle to critically approach popular culture and how reality TV was transforming the business of making TV shows, altering the cultural landscape in America, and subsequently in the world at large. Our Editor-at-Large Lynn Hirschberg has been working on this subject for a long time, she was fascinated with the success of Kim ... It is still one of our most successful covers at the newsstand and it has been a gift that keeps giving on our website. And when we prompted Vanessa Bellugeon, editor-in-chief of French fashion magazine L'Officiel, as to why Kim and Kanye appeared on the Spring 2013 cover of L'Officiel Hommes (a men's magazine adapted from L'Officiel), she explained: Kim and Kanye are pop icons, in the sense that Andy Warhol meant it: they are part of our contemporary pop culture, embracing high-end fashion, music, mainstream popularity and cutting edge creativity. This approach is precisely at the core of L'Officiel de la Mode et de la Couture's DNA. So, there you have it. Kim K. is the icon of our time. Icon or not, she did look pretty damn hot in most of these images. Check out her most major magazine covers over the years and let us know if you think she was deserving.  "

      "text": "Early on in my childhood I had my skincare routine down. After sitting in a stinking bath of colloidal oatmeal, I would dry off, making sure to gently pat my skin rather than rub. Then I would grab a big bottle of Eucerin or Aveeno (depending on the season) and would slather it on as my mom would call down the hall, \"Are you putting your lotion on?!\" And in response I would roll my eyes, \"Duh, mom.\"  In the summertime, I swam pretty much every day at the local pool -- but that meant rinsing off immediately and facing the harsh consequences of chlorine and the blazing sun. I had to take such care with my skin because of one problem: eczema. If you've ever experienced the rash, you know it can be an irritating, itchy mess. But it doesn't always have to be that way. By knowing what to avoid, you can go a long way to preventing and improving outbreaks.  I talked to a couple of dermatologists who helped me to understand what all sufferers -- adults and children alike -- can do to take care of their extra-sensitive, itchy, eczema skin.  What To Lookout For: Fragrant soaps and lotions: \"People with eczema should avoid covering their bodies with fragrance,\" says board-certified dermatologist Dr. Adrienne M. Haughton, the assistant vice chairman and associate program director of the Department of Dermatology SUNY at Stonybrook. \"Therefore, all of the fragrant body washes from places like Bath & Body Works should be avoided,\" she says. But she adds, if you have to have a signature scent, it's far better to use a fragrance spray that you can spritz directly on your clothes, rather than your body.  Household irritants: This is especially important if you have kiddos who have the rash, as they could accidentally come into contact with these items. Dr. Haughton cautions against irritants like cleaning products and detergents, which have harsh chemicals, fragrances and acidic pH levels that when in contact with your skin, can cause different reactions -- but if you have eczema, they can inflame an already aggravated rash.  Harsh beauty products: Pay special attention to what you use on your face. For example, \"Many anti-aging products may be too irritating, as well as makeup remover, some sunscreens and acne products,\" says Dr. Haughton, because of salicylic acid, retinol and glycolic acid in these products that combat against oil -- meaning they will make your skin drier than it already is. Pets: Since eczema is thought to be an overactive immune system response and is often linked to other allergic reactions, pet dander from both cats and dogs can contribute to flare-ups.  Exercise: According to Dr. Haughton, chlorine and sweat are two triggers for eczema. After going swimming it might be a good idea to at least rinse off your body, and if you're a heavy sweater, pay special attention to areas like the insides of your elbows and the backs of your knees.  A dirty environment: Like pets, dust mites and mold also stimulate allergic reactions such as rashes and hives -- they can show up in carpets, rugs, curtains, bathrooms and various forms of furniture. To curb added irritation from the allergy inducing fuzz, make sure to keep your surroundings as dust and mold-free as possible, so your own home won't make you itch.  The One Ingredient You Need To Know: Ceramides Dr. Debra Jaliman, a New York City-based, board-certified dermatologist advises the use of products that include ceramides, which she says are very important for hydrating skin.  \"[Ceramides] contain lipids, the same fats that are found in your skin and do an outstanding job replenishing them,\" agrees Dr. Haughton. Basically, ceramides are comprised of fatty acids and found in your epidermis -- they contribute to the water repellant layer of your skin, which helps protect you from external drying factors.  Although many people haven't heard of them, they are the main ingredient in heavy duty moisturizers like CeraVe.  Recommended Regimen: Here are some daily practices that will help keep your eczema at bay.  Use lukewarm water: \"[You] should avoid hot steaming showers,\" says Dr. Jaliman and Dr. Haughton agrees, listing steam as a trigger. Although a long, hot shower can be very relaxing, remember that this can irritate the skin if you consistently shower like this day after day.  Invest in some good wash cloths: \"Use a soft cloth or cotton pads to wash your face,\" advises Dr. Jaliman, because they won't tear or rub your skin the wrong way.  Practice good hygiene, overall: Cleaning your body after a long day is super beneficial as it will remove the bacteria that could be making your eczema worse. For example, there are cases of eczema herpeticum, which is a viral infection that can be caused by poorly treated atopic dermatitis (the typical rash you see if you have eczema).  Eczema herpeticum involves lesions and boil-like eruptions and if left untreated, there can be some severe side effects, such as blindness or death. Dr. Haughton recommends that you seek medical attention immediately if you show symptoms such as boils on top of atopic eczema, fever and swollen lymph nodes. \"Any patient with eczema herpeticum will need to be hospitalized for antiviral medications,\" Dr. Haughton says.  As mentioned, try using lukewarm rather than hot water for showers. The same rules go for cleaning your face, which both dermatologists say you should wash twice a day.  Mind your towel manners:  After cleansing, \"pat your skin dry,\" says Dr. Jaliman because the friction from the rubbing can cause additional irritation.  Know when to apply ointments: Dr. Haughton recommends putting any topical prescription \"while the skin is still damp, to the areas that are flaring,\" she says, adding that you should moisturize your entire body as a final step. \"The goal is to trap in some of the moisture,\" Dr. Haughton says, since the patches of rash caused by eczema dries out the skin, and when a good moisturizer is used (like one with ceramides) you'll have a protective shield that will keep your skin hydrated, not dried out.

So needless to say, we were thrilled when we found out that Som was designing a reasonably priced collection for Kohl's DesignNation line.  We did, however, have some reservations. Would the lower price-point have a negative effect on the look of the items? Would the luxurious aesthetic translate in the mass market? Luckily, all of our concerns were squashed as soon as we got to take a look for ourselves and chat with the designer. Citing St. Barths as the inspiration for this beachy collection, Som revealed there were \"no challenges working at a lower price point,\" adding that offering his designs to the masses is \"the most exciting part.\" When asked what it is about that exact location that inspires him, Som said \"St. Barths specifically has the perfect combination of French chic with that island, laid-back feel, and I wanted to capture that idea for women everywhere.\" His impressive design career includes more than a slew of collections. Som is a two-time nominee for the Perry Ellis Award for Emerging Talent and of course, has plenty of experience dressing celebrities like FLOTUS. \"Michelle Obama is not only an amazing, accomplished woman who is doing wonderful things, she also has a great sense of personal style. She is really dressing the way modern women dress, mixing high and low -- really having fun with it,\" he said of the First lady. So, was she another source of inspo for the line? \"It's funny. In every collection, there are a lot of dresses, and I always think in the back of my head, 'is this a Michelle Obama dress?'\" We can't blame him for thinking that, and we have to admit we can see her rocking one of the maxi dresses come summer.  You can shop the collection online now and in Kohl's stores starting April 10. Take a look at Som's favorite pieces from the collection below, including a menswear inspired jersey vest that is definitely going on our must-have list for spring.    "

      "text": "Credit cards are a useful tool for managing purchases, building credit, and reaping rewards point, cash back, or travel points. Unfortunately, the terms of credit cards change regularly, and a card which once had a great rewards program might not be as enticing as it once was. Every year, it's a good idea to compare cards and ditch certain ones in the bunch. While you are busy preparing for spring cleaning around your house, take the time to do the same for your finances -- including your credit cards. 1. Do the math If you're enjoying the perks or credit card rewards from using a certain card, but it's costing you more in fees than the rewards are worth, it's probably time to rethink using that card. Perks and rewards like travel miles always come at some cost, but if the same benefits can be had for less through other programs, ditch the card. 2. Change in credit score When someone's credit score drops, it's entirely possible that a bank may change the terms of a credit card issued to them. The result is usually higher interest and annual fees. However, an uptick in one's credit rating isn't going to prompt the bank to upgrade the card. If you've had a credit card for a long time and your credit score has improved, you may be eligible for a better offer, but you have to ask. Call the issuing bank and ask if you qualify for any better programs, or check to see if other companies have better deals. 3. New offers New credit card offers might be available that offer similar features and benefits to cards you currently carry, but may have a great introductory offer, like a low rate on balance transfers, bonus miles, or some other program to sweeten the deal. If you're planning on going after another card, be sure to call your current bank to see if they'll offer any incentives to keep you as a customer. 4. Changes in airline miles With airline mergers and a difficult market, many of the airline miles rewards programs have changed. Many customers are unhappy about changes to Delta's mileage rewards programs and are looking for other travel bonus alternatives. Or, maybe you aren't flying as much and rewards based on frequent flyer mileage points aren't as interesting as cash back or shopping discount programs. If making it into a higher rewards status category with an airline mileage program isn't realistic this year, it might be time to rethink any credit cards you're carrying which offer miles. Likewise, hanging on to a credit card you're unlikely to use isn't a great idea, since the company will eventually close an account with no activity, and paying annual fees for a card collecting dust isn't a wise use of money or a credit line, either. A caveat It's important to remember that every time you apply for a new credit card, that information is calculated into your credit score. Too many inquiries into one's credit history in a short period of time can have a negative effect on your credit rating, so choose carefully and don't apply for every offer you find. Also, if you do end up closing certain cards, be sure to read this article about the Pros and Cons of Canceling vs. Cutting Up Your Credit Cards. Even if you convert a credit card into another one through an existing relationship with a bank, you might get a ping on your credit report. If you know what your credit score is before applying for a card, you can call in and ask about what the minimum score, income and other factors required to get into a different program before actually submitting the application.

Hair, skin and nails often have different needs in the warmer months, and of course, it never hurts to do a little spring cleaning and updating in this area of life as the new season starts. Sunscreen is a non-negotiable no matter what age you are. The editor favorite here at Condiment is Supergoop's Save Face moisturizer. It's lightweight, water resistant, with SPF 35, plus cruelty free, paraben, frangrance and oxybenzone free. The smallest dab covers a lot of ground on the face and neck. For the body, Coola Sport SPF sunscreen spray is 97% organic and packed with all kinds of ingredients good for the skin like aloe, fruit extracts and oils. The spray makes covering exposed skin on the shoulders, back, arms and legs easy. It's water resistant for up to 40 minutes and isn't tested on animals. Just because you're keeping the sun's damaging rays away from your skin doesn't mean you can't get a bit of a sun-kissed glow. Self tanners have become so advanced that home application is practically fool proof. Vita Liberata gets a lot of buzz and great reviews with good reason. It gives a pretty, natural glow that can work for any skin tone.  When it comes to makeup, tinted moisturizer can be a spring and summertime saver, including at night. Favorites here include Stila and Flower Beauty, both of which are great for daytime coverage and a soft, glowy look at night. For a little more coverage, Nars tinted moisturizer is great, and has built in primer to even out any imperfections, etc. For haircare, The Lab's hair mask is a Condiment editor favorite. Slather it on your tresses weekly to keep your hair in great shape during the warmer weather months and elements from saltwater, chlorine from the pool, sun, etc. The key to great nails all season is all about the products. The spring and summer months might mean your hands and feet are more exposed than during the winter months, but that doesn't mean you've got to hit the nail salon every week. Invest in good manicure and pedicure products at home to either do it yourself, or maintain what you've had done in the salon. Tweezerman nail clippers are the best hands down that we've tried. For nail polish, Zoya, China Glaze, Butter London and Nars are all favorites -- the key with polish at home is all in the type of product and brush and these are tried and tested favorites here. Go with light tones for easier application when doing mani or pedi at home. We also love Bliss waxing strips for at home bikini waxing. The strips are so easy to use, and work really well.

While the university is not in the heart of downtown Austin, there are still many local attractions around campus including the Harry Ransom Center (where the Gutenberg Bible currently resides) and the Blanton Museum of Art. In addition, the live music capital of the world is saturated with many local restaurants and food trucks, boutiques, coffee shops and concert halls, making it one of the most vibrant and culturally diverse places to live in. Even though Austin is an amazing city in itself, students have come from all over the country and the world to study at UT because of its international recognition and prestigious standing among public schools in the U.S. Known for its scholastic achievers and creative innovators, UT fosters an intellectual curiosity that affords a plethora of opportunities to its student body. Since there were a variety of extracurricular activities to choose from, during my free time I decided to collaborate with other Fashionistas and bloggers, which led me to discover new trends on campus and around Austin. Despite how fashion can sometimes be marginalized in our everyday lives, street style is often encouraged and welcomed here in the Texas capital. The \"Keep Austin Weird\" slogan further exemplifies Austinites' street style attitude and helps to explain the m\uffc3\uffa9lange of eccentric and outlandish outfits seen on campus. While some students still capture the zeitgeist of UT's traditional southern roots wearing cowboy boots and sundresses, others opt for a more casual chic attire to wear to class.  That said, this fashion merchandising student and blogger at The Darling Detail, perfectly epitomizes the classic, perennial look at UT. Showing great aplomb in sporting her outfit, this savvy Fashionista placed contemporary pieces together to create a crisp and clean ensemble. Her blue button-down from Zara paired with her high-waisted shorts from Langford Market, added a refined elegance to the look. Since her attire is very versatile, she paired her garments with different accessories from Austin area designers, such as the handbag from Kelly Wynne and earrings from Kendra Scott. The finishing touches included pastel pink penny loafers from BCBG, sunglasses from Ray-Ban and a scarf from Buffalo Exchange. This Fashionista's look, effortlessly trendy and charming, was very reminiscent of a cross between Poppy Delevingne and Jane Birkin's sophisticated style. Diana Vreeland (former editor-in-chief of Vogue) believed that those who had style shared one thing in common: originality. So, like this Fashionista, it is then incumbent upon us to cultivate our own ideas of originality, whatever they may be: through our personal influences, backgrounds and quirky interests. Whether its having a penchant for combat boots or an obsession with cowboy hats, by channeling and embracing these idiosyncrasies, students will have the ability to express themselves through fashion and continue to personify the true meaning of \"Keeping Austin Weird.\"       Photos courtesy of Danielle Fenson  Danielle Fenson is a junior at the University of Texas at Austin who hopes to study abroad on the International Marketing Program in Paris next summer.

Celli, who lives by the motto, \"It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that bling,\" makes wedding dresses that are NOT for the weak at heart. Now in her 30th year of designing gypsy dresses, Celli has a team of 16 girls that work around the clock \"rhinestoning all the time.\" And like her gypsy dressmaker extraordinaire profile declares, \"whoever has the most rhinestones wins.\"   The designer makes her wedding dresses like almost any other custom designer would start out -- going over ideas with the bride-to-be, picking out a silhouette and running with the design from there. The only time customers have ever \"cussed her out\" or gotten upset with the dress is when there aren't enough crystals.   The reasoning behind the complaint, Celli explains, is that \"status come with bling\" and gypsies are able to express their social position through materialism. \"It's a way that they show they have more money than someone.\" If that's the case, then girls with light-up wedding dresses also covered in fur and crystals must certainly be considered queen of something?  When she's not working on a ginormous gown, work at Celli's studio can involve anything from bedazzling baby shoes (heels included) and pacifiers to pots and pans and the occasional ceiling fan. The most ridiculous thing Celli admits to rhinestoning is toilet paper, and she says she told the client, \"if you're going to flush your money down the drain, I'll absolutely take it.\"  Follow Sondra Celli on Twitter or visit her personal website to check out more amazing designs!

      "text": "By Christine DiGangi, Credit.com It's a good thing to be punctual, especially when it comes to financial matters. Credit scores rely heavily on your payment history, so developing a habit of making on-time payments will help you improve and maintain high credit scores. While tax information isn't generally reported to credit bureaus, missing the deadline for paying the IRS could result in a tax lien, which could seriously damage your credit. But in general, that's the only way tax-related information goes on your credit report. What's a Tax Lien? It's pretty simple: If you don't pay your taxes, the IRS can file a notice of federal tax lien with the credit bureaus, and that's a huge negative on your credit reports. If you owe more than $10,000, the IRS automatically files the lien after taxes have gone unpaid for 30 days (the threshold increased from $5,000 to $10,000 in 2011). At that point, you could see a possible 100-point slide in your credit scores. \"All is not lost if that happens to you,\" said Gerri Detweiler, director of consumer education for Credit.com. \"You need to look into the Fresh Start program to get into an installment agreement.\" She's referencing a payment plan that allows the IRS to automatically debit a taxpayer's bank account each month until the taxes have been paid. If an eligible taxpayer has enrolled in the installment plan, he or she can request the lien be withdrawn. Unlike other debts, the IRS installment plan payments will not be reported to the credit bureaus, so that aspect of the lien will not impact your credit. Other Credit Consequences There are other ways taxes could hurt your credit, which is why you should carefully consider your payment options. Failing to pay your taxes on time may not always hurt your credit, but it could contribute to credit problems. First of all, missing the April 15 deadline may subject you to late-payment penalties, which the IRS outlines on its website. You'll end up having to pay more, and the effect of added expenses could put a wrinkle in your ability to meet other debt obligations. If you decide to pay your taxes with a credit card or personal loan, there's the potential you could see some negative impact on your scores. Adding to your debt load can affect your credit scores as it raises your credit utilization, and if you end up struggling to repay the loan, a poor payment history will have a similarly negative effect. When considering how to pay your taxes, give your credit scores a look. You can see two scores for free using Credit.com's Credit Report Card, and the information may help you determine whether you can afford to temporarily add to your debt load or if you can qualify for a personal loan.

Here's how a debt snowball works: The debt snowball works because you pay more than just the minimum payments each month. The result is getting out of debt faster and with less paid in interest.  You can structure your debt snowball in different ways. The most mathematically sensible option is to pay your highest interest rate debts first. This will save you money in interest and get you out of debt the fastest. Another option (perhaps the more well-known) is to pay your debts from smallest to largest. This option can give you a psychological boost. You gain a quick victory over that pesky $500 medical bill, and you're more likely to stay on track. Of course, all this assumes that you've got some extra money to start paying down that first debt. But what if you're already living paycheck-to-paycheck and can't find spare change hiding in the couch cushions? If this is your situation, here are four ways to get your debt snowball rolling: 1. Lower your bills. Before you try to exist on Ramen just to cut down your grocery bill, look for ways to save on recurring bills. It's more effective to cut down bills like cable, cell phones, Internet, and insurance. This option results in month-after-month savings with very little effort. Start by checking out your list of monthly bills, and try tackling the most expensive first. If, for instance, you're paying a fortune for your cell phone plan, shop other options. Increased competition means many companies are offering excellent deals for new customers.  Or, find ways to cut back spending with your current provider. Drop the data. Downgrade to a cheaper phone. Or move away from your unlimited everything plan to a more limited plan that still meets your needs. As you lower your monthly bills, keep track of exactly how much you're saving. Whether it's $5 on your Internet bill or $50 on your car insurance, that money needs to go back to debt payoff -- not towards unnecessary spending. 2. Sell some stuff. Chances are likely that you've got some stuff sitting around your home. Stuff you don't need or use. Probably some stuff you don't even want.  Instead of letting it collect dust, take time to sell this stuff. Craigslist is a great place to sell unwanted furniture and appliances -- items that would cost more to ship than they're worth. And for smaller or higher-end items (especially collectibles), try eBay. Or take gently-used clothing and toys to local consignment shops. Man vs. Debt guest poster Jenny Newcomer paid off $15,000 in student loans in nine months by selling stuff on eBay. But even if you make nowhere near this amount, an extra few hundred bucks can get you started on your snowball. 3. Start a side gig. So many jobs and businesses out there can bring in extra money on the side while you still work your day job. Start a blog. Deliver pizzas. Wait tables on the weekends. Consult on an hourly basis in your own field of expertise. Babysit on Friday nights. Stephanie Hood is just one example of the power of the odd job. She used babysitting, paid focus groups, and odd jobs on Craigslist to help pay her $90,000 in student loan debt. Bottom line: do what it takes. Even an extra $50 a week (which you can make in no time) makes a difference as you get your debt snowball rolling. 4. Reduce your interest rates One oft-overlooked way to pay down debt involves refinancing. Getting a better rate on your car loan or credit card debt can make a huge impact on your get-out-of-debt plan. Virtually any debt can be refinanced. Whether you are dealing with a mortgage, home equity line, car loan, or even credit card debt, check to see if a lower interest rate is available. Credit cards are arguably the easiest to refinance, as there are plenty of 0 percent deals to be found. By lowering the rates, you free up more cash to put toward the balance of your loans. It's Okay to Start Small When it comes to paying off debt, many people think in terms of \"go big or go home.\" But that's just not how it works -- especially if you're already struggling financially.  You can pay off debt a little at a time. You just need a plan and a way to get started. Any of these four options can give you some cash to get your snowball rolling. And as soon as you start paying off those small debts, your payment snowball will grow. Once you get to the biggest debt on your list, you'll smash through it in no time flat. "

The \"Girls\" star, who was honored with the Point Foundation's Horizon Award for her work in the LGBTQ community, stepped out on the red carpet in a long-sleeved, low-cut Marc Jacobs gown. And while we kind of wish she would have swept those bang wisps off of her face, Dunham nailed the elegant look this time.  She took to Instagram to thank the designer for giving her \"boobs she could use,\" and showed off an adorable Charlotte Olympia clutch that donned the name of her show in block lettering.  Of course, our favorite shot of the night was the one of Lena stealing a smooch from friend and co-star Andrew Rannells, who presented Dunham with the award. What do you think of the look?

But every now and again, the style gods smile down on us and give us something that not only works on everyone, but is also comfortable and extremely practical.  Enter Birkenstocks. Yes, we're talking about the shoes you used to wear to walk the dog. They're back and more appealing than ever. Because let's face it, who wouldn't want to take advantage of a shoe trend with built-in arch support? But let's not get ahead of ourselves. To make Birkenstocks and Birkenstock-inspired sandals work, it takes some styling.

But we don't fault guys for thinking this way -- the pressed slacks, button-up shirt and tailored jacket have long defined men's clothing, and it can get pretty boring. While women get an endless variety of skirts, dresses and even dressy pants (try them!), men get the same plain, solid colored suits their fathers wore. But it doesn't have to be that way. For style insights men can actually use, we're loving Suit Up Weird, a blog that encourages guys to push the boundaries with their fashion decisions, from unorthodox prints to quirky neck ties. Each post collects images under a topic, such as ties, shoes, or even whole outfits for fashion inspiration. The effect of the photos is a clean, well put-together look with a touch of flair that proves dressing to impress doesn't mean always sticking to what's tried and true.

      "text": "In the past six months or so, I've noticed that the vending machines I frequent for a midday snack have gradually been taken over by bottles of Kombucha tea. These tart probiotic teas are a far cry from the cavity-inducing sweet teas that I savor while visiting my home in South Carolina.  However, thanks to ageless celebrities like Halle Berry and Gwyneth Paltrow, who have been spotted sipping on this fermented tea, and its purported health claims that it helps to remedy acne, fatigue and headaches, just about everybody wants a taste of Kombucha. Naturally, this got me wondering about the benefits of this tea, which dates back 2,000 years ago to ancient China.  A 2012 L'Oreal Research & Innovation study found that Kombucha extract was \"beneficial to the skin, helping to maintain moisture and elasticity so it appears more even in tone and texture.\" No wonder it has popped up in cleansers, eye gels and moisturizers. Below are seven Kombucha beauty products and their benefits.   Art/GIF by Raydene Salinas 1. Marie Veronique Organics Treatment Serum. $90, MVOrganics.com. Blended with vitamin B5, niacinamide, argan oil, emu oil and, of course, kombucha extract, this facial serum helps to reduce acne breakouts and control oil buildup.  2. Murad Pore & Line Minimizing Hydrator. $50, Sephora.com. I was already a huge fan of this lightweight moisturizer before taking a closer look at its ingredients label. It leaves your irritated skin calm and virtually poreless.  3. Avalon Organics Lavender Luminosity Revitalizing Eye Gel. $20, Walgreens.com. You can rest assured dabbing this gel onto your puffy and dark under-eyes knowing that it's free of parabens, synthetic colors and fragrances. Instead, you'll get a soothing mix, including aloe vera and lavender.   4. Philip B Chai Latte Soul & Body Wash. $35, Neimanmarcus.com. This body wash smells almost good enough to eat thanks to exfoliating, toning and hydrating ingredients like honey, ginger, black tea and milk proteins. 5. EmerginC Kombucha Cleanser. $34, Dermstore.com. This face wash is gentle yet effective enough to wash away a day's worth of dirt and grime, leaving behind a more luminous glow.  6. Fresh Black Tea Instant Perfecting Mask. $88, Sephora.com. Our complexions can all use a boost after enduring winter, and this black tea, lychee seed extract and jicima root juice blended mask helps to soften rough skin and stimulate natural collagen. 7. Juara Sweet Black Tea & Rice Facial Moisturizer. $49, Juaraskincare.com. Here's another anti-aging option in the form of a Kombucha moisturizer that's safe to use on normal to dry skin, as well as mix with your foundation.  "

The Duke, Duchess and Prince of Cambridge landed in New Zealand on Monday, and if the photo of them getting off the plane is any indication of what's to come on their three-week tour, we have plenty to be excited about -- at least when it comes to Kate's style and glimpses of George. The duchess stepped out looking like a mix between the chicest flight attendant of all time, Jackie Kennedy and just a little bit like Lea Michele in that one scene from \"Glee.\"  A master of monochrome, she looks absolutely stunning in an a red Catherine Walker coat and Gina Foster hat in the same hue, the Telegraph reports, adding that her diamond brooch, in the shape of New Zealand's national symbol, is on loan from Queen Elizabeth II. This marks the first gift sighting of the trip.

You'd never know from her relaxed disposition and smiling face that at 12:30 p.m. when we arrived at her (adorable) West Village apartment, Jamie Stelter had already finished her work day reporting traffic on NY1 News -- which starts promptly at 5:08 a.m. You certainly wouldn't know that she had woken up two hours before that at 3:24 a.m., which she has been doing every weekday since 2010, when she joined the news team. While waking up at that hour may sound scary to some, Stelter maintains a sense of humor about it. \"I always say I'm the first person to use the hot water in the building, so it takes a little while for it to heat up,\" she laughed.  Stelter's bubbly personality and witty banter with news anchor Pat Kiernan has turned her into a household name on the New York morning news circuit, meaning an early day -- every weekday. She finishes her final report at noon, heads to a workout class (Fly Barre is her current fave), runs a few errands, works on her food blog, cooks dinner for her and her new husband Brian (host of CNN's \"Reliable Sources\" and the second half of this super cute media power couple) and gets to bed early.  DVF dress, Michael Kors shoes, DANNIJO earrings So, naturally, one has to wonder when she has time to do anything else, let alone explore her own personal style. And yet every morning, plenty of women look to her for fashion inspiration while they get ready for their day. While she admits that her look off-camera is way different than what she wears on, after 10 years in front of a green screen, she certainly has a handle on what works and what doesn't. \"It's definitely a balance of looking cute, and your age AND professional. While staying just trendy enough,\" she says.  For Stelter, comfort is key both on- and off-camera. \"I never wear heels. I own one pair that I wore to my wedding, and that's it,\" she admits, but saves her more eclectic style for nights and weekends. Showing off her impressive boot collection, she revealed her mantra when it comes to fashion: \"Be comfortable, be yourself, and don't knock the cowboy boots till ya try 'em,\" stressing the importance of \"doing you -- and not what the magazines tell you to do.\"  So, what are some shortcuts she has picked up over the years of an early morning routine? \"I pick out as many outfits as possible on Sundays and I never change my mind the morning of.\" Sound difficult? Maybe so, but having no room to adjust also presents the opportunity to try something new that you may not have tried otherwise. \"You just have to do it,\" she says.  And of course, no routine would be complete without some favorite products. Stelter swears by Somme Institute's face regimen, and is a self-proclaimed \"NARS junkie\" when it comes to her makeup -- admitting she \"doesn't know how she ever lived without\" their tinted brow gel.  The \"Uniform\" -- Theory top, Madewell jeans, Vintage boots, DANNIJO earrings  Waking up when some (night owls) are going to sleep is not for everyone, but so far, for Jamie, it has worked. \"There's something about morning TV that I'm really well-suited for. I could be on the evening news, but I wouldn't be able to show any personality,\" she says. \"Plus --there's something about waking people up in the morning that's really special,\" adding, \"the day I stop liking it is the day I stop doing it.\" An excellent plan, but we hope that day doesn't come for a long time.  You can follow Jamie on Twitter, Instagram, and see her on NY1 every morning.  "

      "text": "You have to recognize the drill by now. Right about this time every year, the financial doomsayers stand up behind their pulpits and declare that the end is near. Americans aren't saving enough to retire, much less pay off their debt. We're doomed, the sky is falling, and so on and so on.  Have you noticed this story seems to pop up each year right about tax filing time? Is this an odd coincidence or something else? Whatever it is, let's look at the facts and see if we can make some sense of what is really going on. Why Personal Savings Sucks More than the new Star Wars From one perspective, it appears that consumers are back to their old ways. Yes, it is true that there were a lot of cutbacks in consumer spending since the beginning of the Great Recession. Yet, now that the money news seems to be more upbeat and positive, many consumers have responded by upping their spending. Actually, in an unwelcome sign for our national economy, the level of consumer debt is increasing again, the same way it was prior to the recession.  If debt is increasing, it makes sense that the savings rate is flat or stagnant. You can see this in the results of a recent survey conducted by the Consumer Federation of American along with the American Savings Education Council. This survey was conducted at the end of a special promotional event to encourage Americans to save more called \"America Saves Week\" (learn more here). This survey revealed that 63 percent of those surveyed reported their savings progress as either \"none\" or \"fair.\" Uh oh, not looking so good after all. Should we be concerned? Yes, and here are the reasons why: You already know that private pensions are pretty much done and gone. As far as government pensions? Well, you know that strapped local governments throughout the nation are doing whatever they can to get out (weasel out?) from under their pension obligations. To add fuel to the fire, there is also a dismal participation rate in employer offered retirement options such as 401k plans. Is there anything you can do? Yes, read on. 3 Things Spock Would Say About Personal Savings 1. You have to take charge of your own personal finance. Wake up, smell the poop you just stepped in and resolve to take care of it yourself. It is \"illogical\" to expect that your government is going to take care of you or to hope that you are the next winner of the Powerball Lottery. At this point, we don't even know how much longer Social Security will even be around. Have you noticed they keep pushing the eligible age further and further away? 2. Doing Personal Savings the right way. Google personal savings tips and you will be handed more solutions than you could ever possibly use. That being said, one commonality to take note of is the importance of making savings a priority. Some personal finance advisors even advise paying yourself first. This is ridiculously easy nowadays with options such as payroll deductions, auto debits from your checking account and the like.  3. Consider unconventional strategies. No, this is not about investing in exotic metals or any other such nonsense. This is about pulling your head out of the sand and taking a good look around. Look at what's working and what's not.  For example, did you know that many checking accounts offer higher interest rates than a savings accounts? What is that all about? Who cares? Just take note and position your money appropriately.  That being said, if you are concerned that you or your spouse will fall for the temptation to spend the money in a checking account, just open another checking account. Then transfer the money from one account to the other. In other words, take advantage of the higher interest rate by stashing your emergency funds in another checking account instead of a measly zero percent interest savings account. Another strategy is to take a good hard look at your retirement savings, 401K plans and the like. Consider overhauling your retirement plan options. For example, there are real action steps you can take today as explained here. As you can see, the naysayers may indeed be correct about the average consumer's savings. However, that should not matter to you. The real power is in your hands. Now its up to you to step up to the plate and do something about your personal savings. "

      "text": "The other day, a guy rode up behind me on his bicycle. As soon as I heard him say something I quickly looked down. It's not a regular holla-back when you know you look much older from the front then behind. And I got a good behind! But the long hair fools them. I don't dress in anything resembling sexy, so it's not like I'm trying to look young and hot. Clean is good enough. So why should I be defensive when I walk the city streets? Why do I feel the need to have a sign on my back saying \"Off the Market?\" I ain't young. And I ain't on the market. As far as I know, there is no way to advertise your lack of desirability in this sexualized culture. So what is a woman of a certain age to do? How do you put out the signal that you're no longer interested in being sexually appraised? That you never wanted to be is irrelevant and we learn that through our awkward bulimic teenage years, when we suffered in order to please. We wore platform heels, and spent time on our ever changing hair; including our politicized body hair. But we don't cut our hair upon marriage; or demarcate our sexual status via head dress or ink here.  We need a symbol celebrating our freedom. I have it.  Women of all ages are still hostage to the male gaze. You can't put a sign on your back saying \"NOT FOR SALE.\" or \"INVISIBLE\", although one can just wait for that to happen naturally. We have earned the right to walk the streets with our heads held high, and not fear the catcall. To wear comfortable shoes regardless of our sexuality. We have earned this freedom from sex, and I want to tell the world I'm done!  I keep healthy for my heart and my life; and how I look is my business. If young guys find me attractive, I don't mind, but I don't want to be in that Venn Diagram between women who are trying too hard to be Madonna attractive; the degrading cougar caricature, and the woman who has given up. I am no longer fertile. I can no longer have babies. Nor do I have the desire. Even if I did, I don't want my female body to be seen as a commodity anymore. Hooking-up culture offends my feminist sensibilities, so I am proud to call myself \"Unhooked.\" Free. But I needed a way to advertise my new status to the world  That is why I wear my I.U.D. on the outside.  I wear my I.U.D. as a necklace.   (You can buy it on a t shirt.) You can't see it from behind, but it announces to the world that I'm off the market. This symbol says what I don't have time to answer. No. Don't bother. Don't come knockin boots. Don't judge me by \"how well I'm aging.\" I know, we shouldn't have to advertise our sexuality; be it preference or cis, gen etc... but it is one of the masks we wear. Wedding rings never stopped men from flirting with me, and although I love a healthy banter with any intelligent folk; male, female, kid, I don't want to imply that I am on the market for a moment longer.  I am unhooked.  I am free! This symbol is the first feminist icon in a long while. It represents our untethering from the objectification and judgement of our sexualized, patriarchal culture. As women, we deserve to feel good about getting this far. Period.  Or, I suppose, the end of a period.  And since this culture doesn't have a way for a modern feminist to keep her heart healthy and avoid awkward encounters, I am announcing the introduction of the I.U.D. as a brand. You needn't have used one; or even be close to my age to wear one; this is a universal symbol; a stop sign.  You are off the hook.  Enjoy this as a symbol of this powerful time in a woman's life. You deserve it.  (Coming soon to a website near you.) -- "

The polished updo and makeup gives way to those stunning diamond earrings. BEST: Bella Thorne   The former Disney star shook things up on the Kids' Choice Awards orange carpet with her copper-colored hair in a half-up, half-down hairstyle, green eyeliner and pink-stained lips. BEST: Naomi Campbell   You know what they say, \"if it ain't broke, then don't fix it.\" And Campbell just can't lose with her signature blunt bangs, smoldering eye makeup and nude, glossy lips.

BEST: Paula Van Oppen   We have to admit that we had no clue who Van Oppen was but this G.R.L. group member is truly unforgettable with her platinum buzz cut, bronzed skin and long lashes. WORST: Lundon \"Da Bridge\" Knighten   Now this how NOT to rock a platinum haircut. Between the glued-on rhinestones, extreme eye makeup and burgundy lipstick, we don't know where to look. WORST: Rita Ora   It's pretty obvious that Ora borrowed from Nicole Richie's 2013 Met Gala look. But we are having a hard time understanding exactly why. At least her red lipstick is perfect... WORST: Elisabeth Moss   The \"Mad Men\" star could have done without the smoky eyeshadow, as it makes her eyes appear bruised and creates a heavy look with her dark hair color. WORST: Chloe Sevigny   Another example of bad eye makeup and really good red lips. Also, where is her other earring? WORST: Lydia Rose Bright   The designer is wearing way too much face makeup and some pretty bad fake eyelashes. And from what we can tell, she's a naturally stunning girl.

We especially love this dress because of its simplicity. It also doesn't hurt that the halter neckline draws attention towards her glowing skin.  Emma Roberts in Finders Keepers  Another lady in white. Emma Roberts did minimalism perfectly in this delicate dress. She expertly paired her light frock with embellished heels and a retro 'do to add a little flavor. Shailene Woodley in Zuhair Murad  When Shailene gets it right, it's so right. The plunging neckline, structured silhouette and gold metallic accents flatter the \"Divergent\" star's figure and make her look about seven feet tall.  Kate Upton in WilliamVintage  Marilyn Monroe, is that you? Upton did old Hollywood glamour justice in this retro-style black dress, statement earrings and bouffant updo.  Natalia de Molina in Michael Kors  This is a printed maxi dress that works. The scale of the floral print is the ideal size so it isn't overwhelming when worn head-to-toe, and the cut-out adds just a hint of sex appeal.  "

      "text": " What does it take to push past the standard parameters of beauty and social norms? Who do you enlist to help you with such a bold and unconventional mission? These are two questions recently answered when I sat down with Chad Saville, the Editor-in-Chief of Beautiful Savage magazine, an indie mag that boasts finding the beauty in an aesthetic that often challenges your perspective and your comfort zone.  On the eve of their spring issue launch, we discussed the meaning behind Beautiful Savage's controversial men's issue that explores new ideas around masculinity while providing us beautiful and stimulating visuals to tell their story.    Saville has always been a writer. His fascination with glossies as a kid pushed him to study journalism in college. While pursuing this career it became clear that journalism in the traditional sense wasn't a great fit for him. He ditched that idea all together and got into digital. Little did he know that this path would lead him right back to writing and creating content in new and exciting ways.  Without the backing of a traditional editorial experience, Saville and a few of his Brooklyn buddies started Beautiful Savage magazine. They saw the white space in the market which, was that space in between traditional glossies and magazines displaying an aesthetic that was visually beautiful but had an underlying challenging or dark theme. \"Art that makes you feel challenged or conflicted in some way, that's the feeling I'm always trying to get to\", says Saville.  Well, the Beautiful Savage team accomplished just that in their spring men's issue. Taking on the loaded topic of masculinity is no easy task. Though a very relevant topic it is not one that has yet been presented in extremely visually appealing ways in many of the standard magazines. Saville likes to think that \"We are pushing the boundaries of gender just a tiny bit.\" Rowshana Jackson, Beautiful Savage's Fashion Director, has similar thoughts on presenting visuals for the men's issue. \"This issue is about every man. My inspiration came from Chad [Saville]. His aesthetic, his person and his curiosity about life is what I ran with. All of what you will see is just a collection of inspirations I've pulled from those I'm working with.\"  For example, one of their features is JD Samson who identifies as gender non-conforming. Though born a female, you get an authentic johnny boy feel when around Samson. \"The lines between masculine and feminine are blurred,\" says Saville.  \"The agenda of this issue is to celebrate mankind and it's the Beautiful Savage answer to titles like 'Man of the World', 'Dapper Dan', and 'Fantastic Man'. It was inspired by a chance stop in front of Bowery Iconic's store front by Saville. He saw many of the men's issues and wanted to make them better, darker and cooler while still pushing boundaries. Saville wanted to show the spectrum of the male. The issue explores the range of the alpha male all the way to gender non-conforming with the underlying young, dark, eclectic aesthetic Beautiful Savage is known for.  Though the spring issue deals with many loaded social topics centered around masculinity Saville is quick to note, \"As a human being I care about social issues but as an editor I'm not trying to preach on people I'm just having fun. We do these things because A. its fun and B. it looks really good.\"  The aim of Beautiful Savage is to uncover the best artists, the best photographers, the best musicians etc. who are creating on their own terms. The magazine celebrating these people because Beautiful Savage are those people. It's about encompassing a certain creative freedom.  \"Everything about Beautiful Savage is about the community of people we work with. I know who is around me, they know my vision, they know the aesthetic of Beautiful Savage. Its just about embracing the people that people around us.\" --Chad Saville To pick up your own copy of the Man Issue, head over to Beautiful Savage.

      "text": "I met Erin Hazelton when she was writing for fashion magazines in New York City. This was more years ago than I care to remember -- but she looks the same. What struck me the first time I saw her, and still what strikes me every time I see her is how she exudes pure elegance. She reminds me of my godmothers, whose style tips I wrote about here, and indeed, their style philosophies are not that far apart.   Erin Hazelton (Courtesy of Erin) Last week in Geneva we met at the Mirror Bar of the Metropole Hotel in Geneva, and I couldn't help but make her promise to put her style philosophy in writing. Here are her tips. Which means two things for me. First, I am going to clean out my closet. Second, when she comes to Washington, DC next weekend, we are going to go shopping together!  Thank you Erin for being an inspiration -- of style and of substance.  (As told to me by Erin Hazelton)  Fashion:  1. As Diana Vreeland once said: \"Too much good taste can be boring.\" To offset this truth, I often find myself using leopard as a neutral. There is a fine line between being vulgar and interestingly chic. That said, never take your clothes too seriously. A little touch of humor -- or extravagance -- can make an otherwise uninteresting look seen instantly smart.  2. Keep it neat. If you are going to wear something oversized on top, keep the bottom skinny. If you are going to wear billowing trousers, tuck in your top to show off your waist or opt for something that is closefitting or waist-skimming, otherwise you risk looking messy.    Erin Hazleton (Courtesy of Erin) 3. Dress for your body type, not for the latest trends. A cropped top and high-waisted trousers is a current look I like... but that doesn't mean everyone should wear it.  Learn to work with your body, highlighting the parts you like. Belt a small waist. Show off your shoulders. Camouflage the parts you are uncomfortable with. Narrow shoulders and no boobies? A deep V creates some shape up on top. My best friend thinks her hips are too big, but she has a tiny waist, so her favorite proportion is a full skirt with a high waist. Poof! Her hips are hidden under a swish of fabric, only her tiny waist left behind to be admired. I've also adopted this look for myself, but for the opposite reason: my hips are too narrow and I like to give the illusion of a more hourglass shape.  If you don't like your arms, don't wear sleeveless tops, even if you love the top. You aren't going to feel comfortable wearing it, your arms constantly on your mind. If you don't feel great, you don't look great.  4. Lulu Lemons are wonderful and flattering, but they are intended for the gym and, at a stretch, grocery shopping on your way home from the gym. Try to wear real clothes when you are not working out.  5. A boat neck is always flattering... and elegant.  6. My mother taught me to always buy high quality coats, shoes and handbags. They are the things you use everyday and the things everyone will notice first.  7. It's almost spring: show off your ankles. Trousers that hit just above the ankles are always chic... think of Grace Kelly and Audrey Hepburn. Pair these trousers with flat sandals or college loafers for day and choose an elegant pump or high-heeled sandal for evening.  Which brings us to shoes: 8. Just say no to big platform pump. I don't care how short you are, there is no excuse for looking like a stripper. If I see another actress walking the red carpet in a pair of these uniformly colored hooves, I'm going to start a petition.  If these kinds of shoes are hidden under a floor-length gown, fine -- no one can see them. But if you can see them? No. Absolutely not. If you need height opt for a sculpted wedge or an over-the-top, Miu Miu, proclamation platform or a shoe with a subtle, hidden platform, but if you think a two-inch platform is invisible because it's the same color as the rest of your shoe, guess again.  I'd sacrifice an inch or two of height in the name of fashion any day. 9. Everyone should own a nude shoe. Because the shoe matches your skin tone, there is nothing highlighting where your leg ends, which helps to give the illusion that they go on for much longer than they actually do. I've never heard anyone complain that her legs look too long.  Whether it's a flat sandal, a simple pump or high-heeled sandal in the perfect shade of nude, you can't go wrong: they go with everything. I usually pair mine with floral prints or bright colors... nude and red is a classic combination.  10. The black pump. It seems obvious, but there is nothing more useful than a black, closed toe pump. Elegant and timeless, this shoe adds quiet elegance to any look. A slight point to the toe is more modern and helps to add elongate the leg.  11. If you feel your outfit is a boring, the best way to make it more dynamic is to dress it up with an embellished shoe. Leopard print, gold or beaded and embroidered are among my fancy shoes of choice.  Other accessories: 12. Just like on Wall Street, more is never enough. A little gold letter on a chain around your neck isn't going to change your look, but a huge cuff on each wrist? Or a shining statement necklace or oversized Eddie Borgo tassel necklace peering out from under a white button down? Kind of brilliant.  \"Too loud?\" you say? Open up any J. Crew catalogue and ask yourself again. Prodigal is the new preppy.  13. Don't be scared of a fancy cell phone cover. A golden gate motif, a bejeweled peacock, a Chanel perfume bottle on a chain, or a cover entirely encrusted with pearls? Why not? Cell phones are already kind of obnoxious. Embrace it. 14. Pearls never go out of style. Never. I'm a big fan of wearing them in a more sensual or slightly punk way -- never too literally. I love a pearl choker, a Dior pearl \"piercing\" or one of Ana Khouri's pearl ear cuffs. I leave the tidy, boring single strand to my mum.  15. Handbags are another great way to add some character to a look. Never buy a boring one. If you go for a classic shape, why not buy it in red or kelly green? That said, it is difficult to wear a color everyday, so you will inevitably resort to a black, brown or nude everyday bag -- we all do.  This \"everyday\" handbag is the one you will wear most, so while it may feel boring -- it has to go with everything -- make it special. Let this bag be the one you spend the most on. Go for luxury. Herm\u00e8s is obviously the ultimate choice, but perhaps not the most realistic. Look for a bag by your favorite designer or brand and make sure it's not an \"it\" bag... one that you've seen in every magazine or on the arms of all of your girlfriends. You want it to last, not look dated by next season. You also need to make sure it is big enough to hold all your stuff and has a shoulder strap. Being dominated by your handbag isn't chic, but being able to maneuver your way through the day with both hands definitely is.  If you the bag passes these tests, hold you breath and blow the better part of your paycheck. This is an investment piece.  Erin in Alaia (Courtesy of Erin Hazleton) Beauty: 16. Take care of your skin. Figure out what works for you and stick to it. The worst thing you can do is to constantly change your beauty routine. You'll aggravate your skin. I like a gentle cleanser, a lightening serum, a light moisturizer with SPF for day and something a bit heavier at night. Find an eye cream targeted to your \"issues\": dark circles, puffiness, fine lines. I also use a gentle, at home, tri-weekly peel to keep my pores clean and my skin glowing. 17. A light foundation hides a multitude of imperfections. Even skin tone is a must. Find a great foundation that perfectly matches your skin. (I like \"invisible\" formulas like Giorgio Armani Maestro Fusion Make-Up and Koh Gen Do Manifanshi Moisture Foundation). Apply with your fingers or a foundation brush and then cover up any residual spots and under eye circles with a cover-up (I swear by like Kevyn Aucoin's The Sensual Skin Enhancer).  18. Mascara or discrete eyelash extensions are really all you need to finish your makeup look for day. Healthy-looking skin and long lashes can take you quite a way... 19. If you need more, a bronzer or taupe/brown eye shadow brushed in a straight line and blended under your cheekbones adds instant definition. A bright pink or apricot blush on the apples of you cheeks makes you look fresh and awake. Like you just ran a 10K.  20. Try to keep your nails neat. If you don't have time to paint them, cover them with a clear coat of shine. This will also add an extra layer of protection against splitting and chipping. If you do have time for color, I'm partial to the classics, only using reds, almost invisible pinks and the occasional beige.  I go wild with jewelry, but nail art terrifies me.  21. Hair. Hair is a tough one. I'd love to get a blowout every other day, but that's not realistic (more like once every three months). Keep a travel-sized brush in your handbag or car and run it though your hair when no one's looking (preferably not in public) and you'll look like you just walked out of a salon... until the wind hits you, then game over. 22. I might get some flack for this, but don't dye your hair unless you have to. Chances are your natural color looks pretty good, even if you find it boring. Un-chemically treated hair often looks healthiest... and it won't go brassy or green after a few months. If you do need to color, opt for a natural, vibrant shade and then take good care of it. Nothing looks worse than dried out locks, ratty roots and artificial color.  23. I once met a countess who told me she always wears her long hair up in a chignon when she went out in the evening. That always stayed with me and a standard I often follow. But since my husband really likes my hair down, I break this guideline for him... sometimes. "

      "text": "When you first learned to drive a car, you probably didn't handle the car like a NASCAR racer; you fumbled around with the stick shift or hit the accelerator too hard, maybe even running up on the curb. Watching a beginner in any field is ugly. It's the same with investing. Like any skilled craft, it takes practice and discipline. Unfortunately, the stakes are higher than in most fields -- sometimes, your life savings are at risk.  Retail investors -- that is, everyday people and not corporations -- face two seemingly unpalatable choices: Step into the arena of the financial markets, and place their savings at risk, or park their money in a savings account and let inflation erode the value of their money as the years pass by. Fortunately, the dilemma is more imaginary than real. Average people can profit from investing by learning to mitigate risk. Investing well is a lifelong pursuit, but a little knowledge can prevent you from making disastrous mistakes with your finances. In my own career, I've seen amateur investors make the same mistakes repeatedly, with cringe-inducing results. In the police line-up of bad investments, these are the usual suspects. Steer clear of them and you'll avoid getting mugged by the markets. 1. Investing in industries you don't understand. Several years back, I came across the executive of a local bank who had owned a large chunk of stock in his own company. Sometime in the late 90s, on the advice of a broker, he liquidated most of this stock and decided to diversify his investments. At that time, the stock market was in the middle of the dot.com boom and investors were throwing money at start-up companies, completely overlooking the soundness of these companies as businesses.  Mr. Bank Executive had friends who invested in tech stocks and earned absurd returns of 80 percent or more per year, and of course he wanted to cash in on the stock bonanza. He invested exclusively in software companies, even though this guy never used the products they produced or had more than a vague idea of what they did.  You can guess what happened; by 2002, he had lost about two-thirds of a million dollar portfolio after the dot.com bust and the post-September 11 slump demolished the companies he had invested in. The moral is this: If you want to pick your own stocks, as opposed to letting a fund manager do it for you, you must do your research and look at the fundamentals of the company. Warren Buffet, the richest investor in the world, spends countless hours examining the SEC filings and shareholder reports of the companies in which he invests. He repeatedly warns investors to stay away from companies that make products and services they don't understand.  2. Basing calculations solely on past results. Around 2004 or so, our company advised a client who owned a successful auto parts business. He was middle-aged, with years of business experience under his belt and roughly a million dollars in savings that he was looking to invest. Mr. Business Owner found a sure-fire method of picking stocks: Look at a stock chart, find the stocks that had risen the fastest in the past and invest in those. His reasoning rested on the assumption that the stocks that had risen in the past will continue to rise in the future, because the future must always resemble the past. But of course, applying such crude logic to everyday life would yield ridiculous results: If you lobbed a hammer into the air, you wouldn't assume that it would continue to rise infinitely simply because it had continued to travel upward for the last few seconds.  The key to selecting stocks is to find companies that are undervalued with a potential for growth, and buy them before their value increases. Though our guy's method seemed logical on a superficial level, it revealed a fundamental misunderstanding of the market: Sometimes an increase in a stock's price can't be sustained because the stock is overrated or the company has maxed out its potential for growth. As a result of this mistake and other errors, the business owner lost about $100,000 of his portfolio value. (Eventually, he turned the entire portfolio over to my company, and we were able to help him recoup his losses with a more nuanced investing approach.) 3. Focusing on the level of return only. Mr. Business Owner made another gross error. He developed a kind of tunnel vision that caused him to look at the growth of a particular stock without any regard to risk, which led him to invest mainly in small cap and international growth stocks while neglecting safer (but duller) blue chip stocks. His goal was to earn a 15 percent annual return on his stocks. But of course, you don't get something for nothing: in order to make that kind of return, you have to assume heavy risk -- a burden that he ultimately couldn't stomach. As a result, he ended up selling his stocks when the market bottomed out and using the money to buy low-yielding certificates of deposit. This brings me to the next point... 4. Pulling your investments in and out of the market at random intervals. Another client of ours was an office manager who had a healthy amount of money in a 401k account with her employer, who managed her funds prudently. However, she sliced off a section of her savings, calling it her \"fun money,\" and decided to get a higher rate of return by investing it on her own. Luckily, she invested most of this money in reliable blue-chip stocks. Her stock choices were fundamentally sound, but the problem was her inability to pick a strategy and stick to it. Several times, the markets got rough and even her blue-chip stocks underperformed. She then called me and my partner and directed us to sell off her stocks. She told us that she wanted to get out of the markets, protect her wealth, and \"wait until the market got better.\" \"How do you know when things will get better?\" we asked her. \"It's not as though a bell will ring and tell you when the markets are safe.\" She replied, \"I feel it in my bones that it's time to get out.\" Against our advice, she pulled her money out of the stock market and placed her money in low-interest CDs. Naturally, when the market started to go up again, she regretted her decision and directed us to reinvest the money in stocks. And then -- you guessed it -- stock prices would decline, she would pull the money out, and the same pattern would repeat itself. This client had an uncanny knack for doing the wrong thing at the wrong time. Her intuition was the best predictor of short-term stock movements that the world had ever seen -- except that stock prices always moved in exactly the opposite direction of what she expected. If she had left her money in, the stock values would have eventually returned to their previous levels, she would have recouped her losses, and she would have started earning a profit again from the power of compound interest. Instead, over a period of four years, she ended up losing about half of the $50,000 she had invested.  You might be a conservative investor or an aggressive investor, but you need to decide on an investment strategy and stick with it. In the long run, the markets tend to move upward. If you keep moving your investments in and out of stocks, then you're depriving yourself of the ability to earn interest on your money. 5. Dumping your life savings in one investment. Will company x be the next Google, or will it be the next Enron? No one knows, really. Market analysts can devise sophisticated metrics and analyze the company's finances, but no one can really predict whether a company will succeed or fail. That's why financial planners keep repeating the mantra of diversification. Of all the lessons of investing, this is the most important. I've seen lack of diversification produce some disastrous results. A case in point: Before the housing bust, my company took on another local businessman as a client, this one the owner of a successful construction business. At age 50, he had become a self-made millionaire in ten years, creating a business worth $25 million. During a meeting with him, we found that his entire net worth was completely tied up in his own company (he even had an unpaid mortgage on his home). Though the business was doing well at that time, we saw a red flag: It's unwise to put all of your wealth in any one investment, no matter how sound it appears. So, we advised him to save off about $5 million of his equity in the company and use the money to pay off his mortgage and set up a well-diversified portfolio of stocks, CDs, municipal bonds, and alternative assets (oil, currency, commodities, etc.). He only partly followed our advice: He invested some money in municipal bonds, but then turned around and put the bonds up as collateral on a bank loan to buy new equipment. Around 2008, the great housing bust hit California, and our client's construction empire crumbled. Demand for building slowed down, revenue dried up and he could no longer pay his creditors. His construction business collapsed. The bank repossessed the municipal bonds when he stopped making loan payments. And to add insult to injury, he even lost his home. He ended up bankrupt. It was a stunning reversal of fortune. I admit that this is an unusual, worst-case scenario. But lack of diversification can be a serious wealth assassin. No investment method is foolproof; if anyone tells you otherwise, hold onto your wallet. Taking the right precautions, however, keeps risk to a minimum. If you don't feel comfortable making your own investment choices, then it's okay to turn your portfolio over to a professional fund manager -- after all, not everyone feels confident enough to install the wiring in their house or fix the transmission in their car. Sometimes a professional can save you time and money. Always remember: your money is a fragile resource, so handle it with care. "

While that might sound pretty simple, Brown is making it foolproof with her book aptly titled, \"Everything Eyes.\" Inside the 120-page beauty book, Brown breaks down simple tips like the five essential brushes you need to do your eye makeup and what to look for in an eye cream. Plus, the second half focuses on how to choose the perfect glasses for your face shape and personal style.  After spending hours delving into \"Everything Eyes,\" we've rounded up seven makeup mistakes girls who wear glasses should avoid. Check them out below! 1. If your brows are messy and unruly, apply a clear brow shaper AFTER color application.  This mascara-like wand with liquid color both tames and defines brows. For a subtle look, you can simply brush up your brows with a brow shaper.  2. If you have a lot of under-eye darkness, skip lining the lower lash line as it will only draw attention to the problem. Instead, apply waterproof mascara to the lower lashes. To soften the line, just use your finger or a cotton swab to smudge slightly. Powder liner can soften a too-harsh gel liner and make it look diffused.  3. Always curl your lashes before you apply mascara, otherwise you may break your lashes.  Crimp at the base of the lashes, then hold the curler for 5 to 10 seconds as you lift up and go. Just once is enough. For a quick pick-me-up, hold the lashes in a curl with your fingertips for a few seconds.  4. The glass in your frames can highlight under-eye discoloration and darkness. So corrector and concealer underneath the eye and in creases is essential. Apply corrector with a brush to the inner corner of the eye area, placing it only where you see darkness. Then, gently blend with your fingers. Next, clean your brush with a tissue before applying concealer.  5. If you have redness around your eyes, stay away from shadows with red or purple undertones. These colors will exacerbate the redness. For a foolproof eye, layer shadows from light to dark. Start with the palest shadow as the base, then layer a medium shade and apply the darkest shade last.  6. The color of your eyeshadow shouldn't compete with the color of your glasses. If you want to do the same color as your frames on your eyelids, try a base hue that's a shade lighter, and go a few shades darker for the crease color. Finish with black liner and mascara.  7. When you have a mix of confident colors on your hair, lips and frames, keep your eye makeup simple. Go clean with only a little liner and mascara -- eyeshadow isn't necessary.

The cast of \"Mad Men\" had a rough time at their season premiere party, while other stars like Elettra Wiedemann fell victim to poor fit and lousy prints.  Check out our picks for worst-dressed of the week, and let us know if you agree. Greta Gerwig  This jumpsuit just doesn't fit the indie actress well. The legs need to be more tailored to give the outfit a more streamlined silhouette and the band around her waist is too thick and too high up, so it's actually making her look wider than she is.  Naomi Campbell  Unless Campbell is making a pit stop in Las Vegas, this ensemble is not okay.  Poppy Delevingne  Printed maxi dresses are challenging to pull off. Since there is so much fabric in a maxi, the pattern can often become overwhelming because it is being worn head-to-toe. Delevingne didn't help matters by opting for long sleeves and a high neckline.  January Jones  We're not exactly sure what's going on here. Between the abstract pattern, gold belt and ruffle accent, we think this dress could have used some scaling back.  Elisabeth Moss  Moss' dress looks about two sizes too small and that slit is a wardrobe malfunction waiting to happen. Not to mention that her black outfit, dark hair and heavy eye makeup are a little harsh for the red carpet.  Isabel Lucas  Organza ruffles can easily skew childish, especially in such a bright hue. Had this dress been in a soft pink, it would have never made this list.  Elettra Wiedemann  We fully support the cape dress, but proportions need to be spot on or else this silhouette can be overwhelming. The model could have really benefited from a belt to help define her shape.  "

      "text": "A few weeks ago, a friend of mine -- let's call her Mallory -- got an unsettling call from her accountant. The accountant had been preparing Mallory's taxes, hit \"Send\" to e-file the finished return, and it was rejected. Someone had already filed a tax return using Mallory's Social Security number. She'd been a victim of tax identity theft. The accountant called the IRS, but they wouldn't talk to her. Mallory called and was directed to the fraud department. While she was on hold, she made more calls: one to a friend at the FBI, another to the FTC and the last one to me. Mallory had just become a statistic. The aftermath of tax identity theft is messy, and since 2012, the number of victims has been on the rise. Millions of Americans who expected refunds--often desperately needed to make ends meet--have waited the better part of a year to get their money back -- and even then only after they had traversed a paper labyrinth to prove to the IRS they had been the victims of a crime. Like many of us, Mallory thought she was doing everything she could to protect her identity from this kind of crime and, as a former senior banking executive, she probably was. Unfortunately, we live in a world where breaches -- and the resulting cases of identity theft -- are rapidly becoming the third certainty in life. Doing everything we can do is no longer good enough: too many organizations have too much of your information in databases that are too easily accessed by the wrong people. Though most people don't know enough about this kind of crime, the IRS investigations of tax-related identity theft are up 66 percent since 2012. The agency says it has identified 14.6 million false returns and stopped $50 billion in fraudulent refunds since then, but the problem continues to grow. Victimization is so rampant that the two most popular DIY-tax software programs (H&R Block's Tax Software and Intuit's Turbo Tax) now offer a window for tax identity theft victims to input their IRS-issued Identity Protection PIN with their other identifying information. So what happens if, or when, you become a victim of tax identity theft? If you know for certain that your identity has been compromised, the IRS has a form for that. But if you've already lost your tax refund to an identity thief, their reporting mechanism may not be enough to resolve your existing case. If you know your information is in the hands of the bad guys, make sure you cover your bases with the IRS as well as the credit reporting agencies, the Social Security Administration and your creditors. While the IRS knows how many thieves it caught, the Treasury's Inspector General for Tax Administration suspects that an additional 1.1 million fraudulent returns (and $3.6 billion in refunds) slipped through IRS filters in 2011. He also reported that the agency issued $183 million in tax refunds that year to identity thieves -- based on the 174,000 Social Security numbers that were used on multiple tax returns in 2011 -- after the criminals had submitted fake returns, before legitimate taxpayers legally filed. If you are one of the unfortunate souls whose identity is compromised with the IRS, you might personally have to do the legwork, and it won't be easy. Mallory is quite experienced in navigating federal bureaucracies, yet still found herself being transferred multiple times and then held on hold by the understaffed IRS fraud department. She wasn't able to get a great deal of information, and her accountant wasn't allowed to help. Mallory only clarified the details of the theft when my colleagues at Identity Theft 911 got involved and a prepaid debit card (which had been ordered by the thief to receive the refund) showed up at the home of her parents. If you find your efforts stymied, it's worth making a call to your insurance agent, bank or credit union representative, or the HR department at work to find out if they have a program to help policy holders, customers, members or employees resolve identity theft issues. You may want to enroll now if it's available, and you may be pleasantly surprised to find that it's free or can be had for a nominal cost depending on your relationship with the institution. It can be a game changer if you become a victim. In cases where your return is blocked or a refund has been issued to thieves, or you are notified by the IRS that you significantly underreported your income (because someone else had obtained employment using your SSN), you'll have to have a police report to start the process of proving to the IRS that you are who you say you are and you've been victimized. Even then, with the backlogs you'll still spend plenty of time on the phone and with paperwork trying to work out a resolution to your case. "

      "text": "It's April. If you're a lover of all things music, all things fashion AND happen to live in L.A. (but definitely not only L.A.), April means one thing... IT'S COACHELLA TIME. That's right, it is the second week of April when Angelenos and fellow nomads from lands far away congregate in the desert to celebrate perhaps the most highly anticipated festival of music, art and fashion. Everybody who's anybody, and everybody who is nobody, grabs their best rags and transforms into a hippie for a weekend.  I think by this point I can safely call myself a Coachella veteran -- 6 years on and still going strong. Of course I love Coachella primarily because of the music, a wonderful sampling of both the known and the unknown. However, it's really hard not to also love Coachella because it truly is a festival of style. People and thus style watching at Coachella is so much fun, with the best part being that there really isn't one conclusive type of style dominating the scene. The festival spawns a maceration of styles from all walks of life.  I myself haven't really decided exactly what I will wear yet, but I do have some simple rules that I follow every time I pack. For any newbies out there, I think you will come up with your own set of rules after the first time, but feel free to borrow these for time being. Here we go... take notes. 1) Be comfortable! Style is one thing, but style shouldn't mean that you are required to be miserable while standing in front of stages for 5-8 hours a day in the heat. Make sure that whatever you wear is comfortable enough for either walking or sitting, while enabling you to combat both the daytime heat and temperature drop at night. Comfort at Coachella is key. 2) No Heels! Yes, I am talking to you ladies. There is no need whatsoever to wear heels on a polo field. Festivals are all about having fun, being casual and feeling comfortable. Unless you plan on sporting a wedge sneaker, leave the heels at home and grab a pair of chucks or comfortable flat boots instead. I promise you will not be sorry. Save your heels for more appropriate places.  3) Makeup? What? Personally, I do not wear any makeup to the desert. I put some sunscreen on my face and allow the sun to paint, not burn, it bronze. If you simply cannot leave your home without even an ounce of make-up, go light as there is no need for your face to melt off in the heat. Allow your natural beauty to dominate your look. 4) WEAR SUNSCREEN! All I'm going to say is that Baz Luhrmann was right. Sunscreen has been my best friend since becoming an Angeleno. You will be able to show your bare face without makeup for eternity if you take care of it and wear sunscreen. It's a must. Don't forget it.  And now on to the fashion... My Coachella must-haves alternate every year depending on my general worldview, my musical obsession at the time, my mood and my mantra. It also depends largely on who is currently my favorite designer and what budget I have allocated for any new purchases. Here is my must list for this year. Replicate, imitate or personalize... and see you in T-8 days in the desert.  Peace, Love & COACHELLA   Ray Bans - Rock Tee - Helena Quinn Dress - Zara Top - Jeffrey Campbell Sandals - Tie Dye Shorts - Nivea Sun Screen - Karina Hobo - Zara Denim Shorts - Lovely Bird Hat - Zara Suede Bag - Vans - Tom Ford Aviators "

      "text": "Most of the time it is a mindless action I do every morning and night. It has just become incorporated into my daily routine -- putting on my bra and taking it off. Recently, a few close male friends asked me about what it's like having to wear a bra everyday after seeing a sizing guide for bras: What does it feel like to wear a bra? How many do you need to own? How much are they? This really got me pondering, and I think it would be good for every woman to stop and really examine this garment that holds so much history and meaning in society.  Some backstory  It seems that having something to protect and promote boobs has been around for centuries. Certain ways of folding fabric to shield the breasts and nipples have dated back to ancient Egyptian and Roman times, among other civilizations. From then, through the Middle Ages, and to the present, women have been wearing some kind of garment on their chest.  The bra we are familiar with today had its beginnings in 1913 with its inventor Mary Phelps Jacob. After getting frustrated with the corset, both the fit and look with her evening dress, she fashioned a bra out of two handkerchiefs and a ribbon. Her friends then wanted a bra too, soon followed by a stranger who wanted to pay Jacob for a bar. This was when the brassiere became patented. Jacob knew she was on to something.  As time progressed into the 1920s, the preferred silhouette for women became more boy-like requiring a flatter-chested look. Corsets were out the window and bras took center stage, which provided women with a more comfortable option. 1940s and 1950s fashion called for breasts to be more cone-shaped, enter the bullet bra. The next trend was the Wonder Bra that came out in 1964 to give the ultimate push-up, but lost favor until the 1990s when this bra had a come back.  Later in the 1960s was when the concept of bra-burning came into existence. Bra-burning was an action to be done in protest where women would set their brassieres on fire. The protest against the Miss America pageant in 1968, while no bras were actually burned, this is where the legend started of bra-burning. Although many women during this time did not actually burn their bras, it was a symbolic notion on the politics of the time. While bra-burning took on many different meaning then and now, it stands that bras embody so much more than just fabric and underwire.  Bras have gone through a lot of transformations -- different fabrics, cup shapes, and support - which are usually the result of shifts in American society that impacts women's roles. American society and the over-the-shoulder boulder-holder Bras have long had a deeper, sometimes emotional meaning in American society. How a woman's breasts look tend to be a much bigger deal to other people than to the woman herself. In my younger years I would wear push-up and padded bras because I was a late bloomer. I wanted my boobs to look like the other girls'. One day I wore a padded bra instead of a push-up -- it gave me a slightly flatter look than the push-up -- and I was harassed by many of the boys at school, openly and to my face. A similar occurrence has happened to many of my female friends and family. This phenomenon also seems to affect women outside of my circle -- even women in positions of power. Actress turned writer/director Lake Bell expressed this in an interview that if you're a woman in a position of authority should you still wear a push-up bra? Because if you do wear one that could that send the wrong message to those you are managing or to those who are above you in the hierarchy in the workplace. It's funny how a garment that is worn under our clothing has such an impact on those around us outwardly.  Bras now Personally, I love bras. I think they can make a woman feel sexy and beautiful. I buy lingerie more for myself than for the person I am with. I also understand that bras can have a deeper meaning, that they come with some extra baggage that most of the time I honestly don't even think about. The more I have spoken with a variety of women the more I believe this to be true for them as well.  I spoke with a previous Victoria Secret sales associate about bras and it was a fantastic conversation about what bras really imply in today's society, both the pros and cons.  \"It seems that a woman will buy that same type of bra over and over, not get any variety. If she is interested in push-up bras she will buy all push-up bras. Actually, push-up bras are the most common style women buy. It's because it gives the look of larger, perkier breasts. Our actual boob size isn't good enough.\"  Bras are a necessary, wonderful evil, I suppose. It is not acceptable to go out in public without one on, and I really wouldn't want to because of possible physical pain (nipples chaffing). I don't like being judged on the size of my breasts, but I do like feeling sexy in a gorgeous bra. It's a daily battle that will continue on for women. There is so much meaning and history in such a small piece of clothing for but then again, isn't that how many articles of women's clothing are? "

But when Tanya Marie Keller hit the stage, there was something a bit ... long about her.  It took the audience no time to realize that she was actually wearing Barbie-esque arm extensions. Keller was a sport about the whole thing, placing her awkwardly long \"arms\" on Ellen's chair, and hilariously attempting to take a sip of water.

Before that, why not tidy up your finances now so that you can enjoy yourself without money on your mind? Make these five money moves and reinvigorate yourself for the spring season (we all need it after harsh weather of this past winter season). Avoid the tax season rush April means the dreaded rush for American taxpayers to complete their tax returns and pay any owed taxes by the April 15 deadline. If you haven't already finished filing your taxes, it's best to avoid the last-minute rush and the possibility of missing the deadline. Get to your accountant now or finally make the effort to sit down and file your taxes on your own. There's still time to contribute to IRAs Saving for retirement should be one of your top financial priorities, but for those forgetful minds out there, the IRA contribution deadline is rather lenient. You have until April 15 to contribute towards tax year 2013. For 2013, you may contribute a maximum of $5,500 ($6,500 for those age 50 or older). Remember, if you miss this contribution deadline, you lose this opportunity to build tax-deferred retirement savings for the year of 2013. Don't have an IRA? There's enough time to open one and contribute before the deadline. Get your credit checked You have access to a credit report from each of the three major U.S. credit bureaus -- Equifax, Experian and TransUnion -- per year. While you can opt to get all three credit reports at once, it is generally a better idea spread them throughout the year. So, every four months, you'll get to see your credit profile. The end of April will mark the first four months of the year, when you should pull your credit report if you decide to split up your free credit reports. Also, don't forget to remind yourself every four months to check your credit. Empower yourself with financial knowledge National Financial Literacy Month is in high gear and Americans are encouraged to learn more about all aspects of money. Various organizations, companies and consumer-focused groups are holding initiatives to promote financial literacy among consumers. Whether it's seminars or financial tips, there are ways that you can participate to improve your financial knowledge. For instance, Money Management International has a 30-step program that aims to help people achieve financial wellness.  Spring financial cleaning With the warm weather, spring cleaning is on everyone's minds. It is also a great time for you to reassess your financial setup. Are there any monthly expenses you can reduce or eliminate completely? Are there any inactive financial accounts that are racking up fees? From your insurance policies to recurring bills, there may be ways for you to cut costs. Then, on the opposite end of the spectrum, remember that you should be saving constantly. Consider automating your transfers and contributions to your savings accounts and IRAs. Simon Zhen (@SimonZhen) is a writer for MyBankTracker.com. "

      "text": "When it comes to making money decisions, doubt and self-doubt are inevitable. After all, unlike many choices that are subject to whimsy and fate, financial decisions can be judged by their direct impact on your well-being, now and in the future. Or to put it simply: It's your money. Presumably you worked hard to accumulate it, disciplined yourself to save it, and now you want advice you can trust about how to manage it. Many of the questions posted on my blog at www.TerrySavage.com revolve around the issue of trust. Of course, people who trust their own financial decision, rarely post questions! Or maybe they just want a second opinion. But many of the questions posted ask me to second-guess advice (or a sales pitch) from a financial professional. My comments must be general, because to give specific personal finance advice requires that an advisor know far more about an individual's personal situation than could possibly be posted on a blog. At most, I can point you in the right direction - a direction that I presume will be the least biased by greed and the most supported by experience and integrity. So what should you know before you take financial advice or direction from an individual or company? What should you ask? What should you expect? How should you double-check? In short, whom should you trust? Finding Trusted Advisors Let me start by saying that there are bad people in every profession, and it is never wise to assume that a title, a degree, an air of superiority, or the appearance of financial success will guarantee you are dealing with an honest person. In fact, the \"trappings\" of success -- lavish offices, public profiles, expensive entertainment and lifestyle -- are far too often the hallmark of a fraudster running a scam. But that's just why scams continue -- because people are blindly attracted to success, even when it seems unlikely in any rational form.  Remember, Madoff didn't advertise. He got his next victims through word of mouth, from people who bragged that he made them money in both up markets and down. How silly in hindsight, and even at the time! So, simply checking references from other clients is important -- but clearly, it isn't the entire answer. When it comes to financial professionals there are several websites that you might use to do a background search. The most comprehensive database on both brokers and investment advisors is maintained at www.FINRA.org, the industry's self regulatory organization. The \"broker check\" feature gives backgrounds on all current and former brokers, brokerage firms, investment advisor firms, and advisors. Recently it was revealed, however that even the FINRA database does not give a full background check of bankruptcies, and other civil litigation. So you might also want to check your state's database of registered brokers and advisors. Just because you are talking with someone who is employed by a big-name, well-known firm doesn't mean you should be complacent. There are plenty of disciplinary actions taken against employees of major league firms. Also, you can do a search at www.CFPBoard.org, and at www.FeeOnly.org for financial planners who have been certified after passing a series of exams, and pledging their duty to their clients.  And speaking of names, don't be overly complacent because of the name on the front door. For example, you might walk into a bank and presume that anything you invest in will be safe and insured. Think again. You could be talking to a representative from the investment company within the bank. The products they offer may have enticingly higher yields, but no FDIC guarantee. Motivation Matters One of the best ways to figure out who's on your side is to understand the motivation and the regulation behind their activities. For example, despite a great attempt on the part of the investment advisory industry to change things, if you're dealing with a broker or registered representative or investment consultant at a brokerage firm, these individuals are not required to put your best interest ahead of their own!  Only a registered investment advisor must adhere to a \"fiduciary standard\" that requires the client's interest to come first, and requires the advisor to fully disclose any conflicts of interest. Brokers are only required to present \"suitable\" investments. Always ask the salesperson how he or she is being compensated. Is it an initial commission that comes out of your investment dollars? Are there surrender charges if you want to get out of the investment? (Those charges help offset the broker's commission.) Are there additional annual management charges levied on your account? There are plenty of financial advisors who only charge fees, and others who combine fees and commissions. But if the salesperson is getting paid only if you make a purchase, you're wise to think twice about his or her motivation. On the other hand, good advice is always worth paying for. But how will you know the advice is good if you don't ask the right questions about risk, reward, and costs? Trust Your Instincts And that brings me back to where I started, with the question of whom you should trust. First, trust your own instincts. If something seems not quite right, don't be pressured into making a decision. Get a second opinion -- preferably from someone who isn't just trying to sell you an alternative product.  There's never an investment opportunity that is so rare, and so pressing, that you can't postpone a decision while you do some research. As they say, there's always another train coming along. In the meantime, while you try to decide what to do, you can just leave your money in an insured money market deposit account, earning little or no interest. You won't lose money by being careful while you make an educated decision.  Better safe than sorry. And that's The Savage Truth. "

Villacorta became involved with Amazon Watch in 2000 because she wanted to work with communities that had been affected by extractive industries such as gas, oil, timber, and gold mining. Amazon Watch, a leading nonprofit, has been working to protect the Amazon Basin and indigenous rights for more than two decades. Executive director Atossa Soltani is a \"primary inspiration,\" and Villacorta continued to contribute financially to the organization when she accepted a coveted role as senior designer at Patagonia, a position she held for six years.  \"Peruvian Rainforest\" -- Designer Violeta Villacorta's friend and inspiration Atossa Soltani, founder and executive director of Amazon Watch, has been championing protection of the Amazon Basin and indigenous rights for two decades, leading successful campaigns to convince oil companies and international financial institutions to adopt stronger environmental and social standards. \"Atossa Soltani's dedication to the protection of the Amazon and its peoples is inspiring, powerful and unwavering.\" - Violeta Villacorta Villacorta spent most of 2009 looking inward for inspiration. \"In the stillness, I listened for insights that would guide me to my true purpose and mission,\" she says. \"At the United Nations International School and the Fashion Institute of Technology, I was immersed in a richness of cultures and global awareness. Although I adopted a green consciousness early in my personal and professional life, it was no longer enough to create earth-friendly goods or live 'green.' I was moved to incorporate my values and skills in work with indigenous Amazon communities -- especially women.\" The 2009 Bagua massacre, in which 33 Peruvians were killed and hundreds injured while peacefully protesting to protect their tribal land resources, triggered Villacorta's calling. She transcribed \"countless hours of footage that was so graphic and so painful to watch and hear for her friends at Amazon Watch and emerged even more determined to work directly with affected communities, \"within my creative realm, rather than through political activism.\" ORG by vio was born. \"I knew I needed to use my skills and somehow work for the Amazon jungle and work with these talented women,\" she says. \"The women are like family, like sisters. They have so much talent and so much to offer. To give them another alternative through the creative field was something that really interested me, and doing something creative with them that brings in money to the community is beautiful.\"  \"Violeta Villacorta with Amazon Women\" -- Designer Violeta Villacorta works with Yanesha women of the Palcaz\u00fa Valley, Per\u00fa, a place she describes as \"a beautiful gem in the middle of the Peruvian rainforest,\" during the group's first workshop and the community's first bio jewelry collaboration. She describes the trip as a \"wonder-filled journey into Yanesha Territory.\" Through ORG by vio, Villacorta shares tools that allow women in indigenous communities to maintain their traditions while creating income and livelihoods. She works hand in hand with the artisans, in person on location and virtually, emailing sketches and designs for collaborative projects and featuring their original works on her website and others. Her goal is to bring together communities that have been exploited. \"Extractive industries send in people with talents of persuasion who tell convincing stories,\" Villacorta explains. \"Some love the promises, and some don't want any part of it, and the friction can really tear the communities apart.\" Villacorta believes that \"the creative force is a unifying energy.\" In 2010, Villacorta began working on creative artisan projects with the Cof\u00e1n or A'i people native to the Napo Province in northeast Ecuador and southern Colombia, whose ancestral land, community health and social cohesion have been severely damaged by several decades of oil drilling. In 2011, she visited the Awaj\u00fan community in Peru and began collaborating with women artisans who create jewelry and accessories from seeds and other plant fiber materials. Blending elements from multiple cultures to create a look she calls \"bohemian chic,\" Villacorta loves the use of seeds from Amazonian jungle plants as well as plant fibers, managed wood and other plant materials. She is also looking forward to working with natural tree rubber.  \"Violeta Villacorta Working on Designs\" -- Violeta Villacorta working on designs for Yanesha Bio Jewelry Project The versatile ORG by vio collection can be worn with a wide variety of looks -- from jeans and a shoulder-baring top to simple, elegant ensembles by designers such as Eileen Fisher or edgy super-stylers such as Stella McCartney. Villacorta would love to see the collections, especially the higher-end jewelry, in stores such as Fred Segal, Anthropologie and Barney's.  \"I'm a big-city girl,\" she says. \"If I lived in the jungle, I would miss the city, but I also love the Amazon, which is true jungle heaven. So, in a way, my designs are also a blend of these two jungles.\" The beads used to create ORG by vio wearable art are actually seeds from flowering plants, bushes, trees and vines native to the Amazon rainforest. \"The plant world -- and jungles even more so -- is all about the spirit of abundance, so it is a designer's paradise,\" Villlacorta says. \"When you're looking for colors and shapes and sizes to work with, there's never a lack of choices.\" \"The communities swap and buy beads from each other all the time,\" Villacorta adds. \"Some beads have meanings, and others are just used because they are lovely to look at. The beautiful red bead with the little black dot is said to bring good luck, for instance. The one that looks like a deer's eye is given to people for protection.\"  \"Amazonian Seed Beads\" -- The beads used to create ORG by vio wearable art are actually seeds from flowering plants, bushes, trees and vines native to the Amazon rainforest. \"The plant world -- and jungles even more so -- is all about the spirit of abundance, so it is a designer's paradise. When you're looking for colors and shapes and sizes to work with, there's never a lack of choices.\" - Violeta Villacorta Supporting women as they create something that brings respect and money to the community also helps create balance between genders. \"In the past, in many of these cultures, men and women worked side by side,\" she says, \"but once they were contacted by ministries, that really changed. Women were no longer respected and listened to.\" During her meetings with the artisan communities, male leaders are still the most visible and vocal, Villacorta says, but women can attend, and when they do, they gravitate toward her. \"The entire project really started because the women could relate to and trust another woman,\" she says. As ORG by vio projects grow and thrive, Villacorta is witnessing something rare and remarkable. \"The young people are hungry for their roots,\" she says. \"They want to learn everything about their traditional artistry. They want to master the art and the craft of it. And while they learn they're also exposed to other precious traditional cultural concepts like shamanism and plant spirit, and they want to learn that too. More and more, they want to learn about the way of the jungle.\" Elders, Villacorta says, are eager to pass on what they know. \"The elders are very happy that young people are interested in what they have to offer again,\" she says. \"They had been told that what they knew was not important any longer. No one wants or deserves to hear that.\" She feels \"humbled and grateful\" to be part of rekindling multi-generational reconnection.  \"Yanesha Artisans at workshop First Day, Yanesha Territory, Per\u00fa\" -- Violeta Villacorta and many other established designers find inspiration in indigenous cultures all over the world, and she believes they should get more credit. \"The cultures that conceived and developed these looks over hundreds, maybe thousands, of years seldom if ever receive any benefit from having inspired the designers. Many of these communities need our support.\" - Violeta Villacorta Establishing sustainable chains of trade with indigenous women is an ambitious challenge to take on anywhere in the world. In the Amazon rainforest, it's more like an anthropological jungle adventure movie, with a femme power protagonist and a colorful cast of women and girls hoping to heal and protect the paradise they live in and steward. Though Peruvian-born, Villacorta is still considered \"foreign\" -- thus suspect -- and must rely on complex, convoluted channels of introduction when searching for ethnic tribal partners. Her big heart, intelligent sincerity, and focus on collaborative-based progress has opened many doors.  Despite the challenges, she remains passionate. \"When we align ourselves with our true purpose, all the pieces fall into place effortlessly and the real work begins,\" she says. \"I believe that the cooperation of people is an indispensable element of building sustainability and creating powerful opportunities and partnerships around the world.\" ORG by vio stands for \"Organic Rainforest Goods (ORG)\" by \"Violeta & Indigenous Organizations (vio).\" "

      "text": "By Chris Walters, PolicyGenius Contributor Are you a \"non-identifying smoker\"? That's what a recent UC San Diego report calls the one in 10 people who meet the technical criteria for a smoker, but who reject the term because they only smoke occasionally.  Or are you one of the millions of former smokers who now \"vapes\"? The e-cigarette industry is growing so fast that the FDA is currently in the process of deciding how to treat it with respect to other tobacco industry products. The distinction is an important one if you're shopping for life insurance. Our brokerage has helped life insurance consumers in both segments -- and sometimes the insurers' smoking assessment policies aren't intuitive. It's important to understand how insurers see things, because otherwise you might end up paying a higher premium than necessary.  The Insurance Company's Point of View When it comes to the insurer's treatment of e-cigarettes, a couple of factors suggest a more conservative view of their impact on health -- and therefore risk classification. First, the FDA is in the process of deciding whether to treat e-cigarettes like traditional cigarettes. In the next few weeks, the agency will announce whether it classifies them as tobacco products (because they attract new nicotine users), or smoking cessation products (because they wean a person from tobacco use). If the FDA settles on the tobacco classification as widely expected, then e-cigarette users will technically still be considered smokers. However, even if the FDA puts e-cigarettes in the smoking cessation category, your insurer might not care. Most insurers lump users of nicotine patches, nasal spray or gum with traditional tobacco users, according to Mike Woods, an insurance underwriter with Pinney Insurance Center. \"In order to qualify for non-smoker rates, the underwriting with most carriers is going to require you to be a full 12 months of no nicotine use at all,\" Woods says. \"Since most of the smoking cessation products still contain some sort of nicotine delivery, that still qualifies for tobacco use rates.\" What Happens if Your Insurer Determines You're a \"Smoker\" After All? Insurers rely partly on the honor system when determining your classification, but that doesn't mean it's a good idea to withhold information. Here are some possible scenarios where an insurer might uncover past use: 1. You say you're not a smoker on the application, but the lab test suggests otherwise. Even the occasional e-cigarette at a party can complicate things, depending on how recently it happened.  Insurers usually test for nicotine usage over the past three weeks at most. These tests don't return a positive result for second-hand or passive smoke, but they'll identify a one-time use if it happened within the testing window. You might think you can abandon the application at this point and try again elsewhere. However, most insurers share application data to prevent this sort of underwriting manipulation, so there's a good chance your test results will follow you to the next insurer. 2. You say you're not a smoker, but during the first two years of the policy, the insurer finds evidence that suggests otherwise. If you withhold information on past nicotine use -- even e-cigarettes -- during the application process, don't assume your history will remain buried once the policy goes into effect.  Evidence of past nicotine use can show up in medical records, public information searches, social media or even interviews with family or friends, Woods says.  If an insurer finds evidence of misrepresentation during the the first two years of the policy -- the period when an insurer can review and contest the policy terms -- then it can cancel the policy and return the premiums you've paid. And if you've had the bad luck to die during this period and the above happens, then your beneficiary could end up not receiving any benefit payment at all. 3. You say you're not a smoker, and at some point after the first two years of the policy, the insurer finds evidence that suggest otherwise. Once the contestability period is over, most states won't let insurers cancel a policy. In these cases, the insurer will adjust the terms of the policy so that it matches what it would have originally sold you, had it known all the facts from the beginning. This means the death benefit amount will be reduced enough to make up for the higher premium that you should have been paying all along.  Translation: The amount of coverage you've purchased will suddenly shrink, and your premium might still go up anyway. The Not-Quite-A-Smoker's Strategy for Buying Life Insurance No matter what nicotine product you use, be truthful with your broker so she can help you find the insurer that best fits your current lifestyle. \"One carrier we've found to be much more flexible is Prudential,\" Woods says. \"Their underwriting will allow non-smoker consideration for smoking cessation products, including e-cigarettes, as long as there's been no 'regular' cigarette use in the past 12 months. For really infrequent cigarette smokers, Minnesota Life can also be a good option.\" If you've recently stopped all nicotine use -- even e-cigarettes -- consider shopping again after 12 months have passed, or look for a policy now that can be modified once your classification changes. Insurers may warm to e-cigarettes in the coming years, but for now most of them will still think of you as a smoker even if you don't. In today's world of semi-privacy, it might be harder than you think to hide evidence of this should an insurer decide to look more closely. If you're either a current or former smoker who's shopped for life insurance, what's been your experience? We'd love to hear about it. "

      "text": "If you're not already familiar with Nicolette Mason, you're going to want to memorize her name. The graduate from Parsons School of Design began her career at a brand design firm; but her keen interest in clothes and runway trends inspired her to launch a personal style blog on the side in 2008. It wasn't long before she was recruited to contribute to big name sites like Refinery29 and write for magazines like Marie Claire. Since then, the freelance writer-cum-editor-cum-designer has worked with Vogue Italia, Chanel and Dior, just to name a few.  But it's actually her work as a plus-size activist that has garnered the most attention. Lucky for us, we got to chat with the Los Angeles native about how she managed to break into fashion and whether she takes issue with the term \"plus-size\" in the first place. You have done so many things in the fashion world. Was there one moment or endeavor that set you apart and launched your career? It's honestly a combination of a lot of things. I was really lucky to start at Marie Claire when I did. I think being in New York was lucky. And then there are also just different access points. Being a privileged person has definitely helped me, and I think that it would be really irresponsible of me not to acknowledge that that plays into it. The fact that I look white and I come from an affluent background has been a huge foot in the door. And I went to Parsons, that was another access point -- I was already around this entire community from the age of 17.  But besides the things I have inherited through privilege, I'm also just really hard working. Being nice and having good work ethic are also really important, and being meticulous and detail-orientated is essential. You still need to be smart and hard-working even if you do have all the privilege in the world.  That's so refreshing that you acknowledge that privilege played a part in your success. Many people don't.  That's really frustrating for me, and that's something I see a lot in the fashion world. I don't think that there is anything inherently wrong with being privileged, but I think you have to acknowledge that that is a factor in a person's success. And it certainly is for me, and it's really important to think about and be critical of.   One of the big facets of your career is your work as a plus-size activist. First, do you take issue with the term \"plus-size\"? I think in an ideal world, we wouldn't have any sort of differentiation based on size, but it's something that... we're not there yet. I don't have a problem with the term plus-size as a way to differentiate what this market is; because until fashion and the word is in a place to present clothing by style instead of breaking everything down by size, it is essential to have some kind of terminology that goes along with it.  But I don't hate the term. There are a lot of different terms that are used in this category and in the market. I don't mind when people use \"curvy,\" as long as it's not being used as a euphemism in place of fat. That I do think is pretty ridiculous -- there are obviously curvy, plus-size people, but there are also plus-size people who are not curvy. Curvy is used as a way to talk about size instead of what it really is, which is body type -- and that's another conversation entirely. But I don't have an issue with plus-size in reference to clothing. I don't identify myself as plus-size. I'm a person. I'm Nicolette and I'm a lot of things in terms of identity, and my body is just part of that.  It seems like every article about you mentions that you are plus-size in the headline. Does that bother you that you're always associated with the term \"plus-size\"? If it's a piece talking about my work in the plus-size world or talking about plus-size fashion, obviously that makes sense. But when there is a feature about my apartment, to be described as \"plus-size girl Nicolette Mason\" feels very reductive. That's the only thing about me that's interesting? What about writer Nicolette Mason? New Yorker Nicolette Mason? There are just so many parts about my identity that to be reduced to \"plus-size woman\" feels really ridiculous.  I don't even think that's the most interesting part of who I am. I'm also very openly queer and political about that, and there are very few openly queer women in the fashion world, and that's not something anyone talks about. I'm also Middle Eastern and Jewish, and I grew up in L.A. I feel like when the only thing we're talking about is body, it reinforces the idea that that's all that is valuable about women and that's how we should be categorized.  But, yeah, obviously I am plus-size. I'm fat. I'm quicker to call myself fat than I am to say I'm plus-size, because that's an accurate description of my body. I don't have a problem with that at all. But when it's the only thing anyone talks about, it's pretty ridiculous.   Women, regardless of size, are constantly being told what they can and can't wear. Do you think there are any rules when getting dressed, and do you adhere to any? I just wear what I like, and that's often not what the most flattering thing is. My personal fashion rule is: Wear what you like and what excites you, because that's what's going to make you look the most confident. You could wear a trash bag, but if you're really confident about it, you're still going to look good. So that's my only real rule.  But what I think is so successful about my Marie Claire column, \"Big Girl in a Skinny World,\" is it really speaks to all women universally. I think women and people in general who are interested in fashion are pretty exhausted with having rules hammered down their throats or being told that they can't wear this, or they have to wear this. It's just really tedious. So to have a page in a mainstream magazine that says you don't have to do this -- you can wear stripes, you can wear white bottoms -- is a refreshing change of pace.  Since you shop so much, have you had any memorable shopping experiences?  I've had so many negative experiences. Like, when I ask \"Can I please see this in a size 14?\" I know what size I am, but pieces always run differently -- if something has an elastic waistband, for example, I know it's going to be more generous. I have a really good fluency in cuts and fabrics and enough understanding to shop for myself regardless of what the tag says. But there are times I'll ask for the size 12 or the size 14, and the sales associate will respond, \"That's not going to fit you.\" Most of the time, I just learn I'm not going to bother shopping in stores when I can go online -- I don't need to give this person permission and have them rewarded for the money that I'm going to spend. I can go online and not have to deal with it. That's a psychological conditioning that's been a product of being snubbed by sales people all the time.  I had one bad experience in the West Village where I was looking for this See by Chlo\u00e9 dress. I knew it went up to a size 14, and I knew that they had it at Bloomingdales, but I lived in the West Village and I saw it in the window of this boutique. But when I went in and asked for it, they said, \"We only stock it up to a size 8.\" I was like, \"Well that's ridiculous. The brand makes a full size going up to a 14, can you order it?\" And they replied, \"No, we can't do that, I'm sorry. This isn't the right place for you.\" That really pissed me off because this designer, who has designed it and is worthy of their boutique, does make a bigger size run. But the way they buy [stock] for their store is essentially implementing their own sizing discrimination. That was a shitty one.  I had a really good experience in Paris, of all places, where I was shopping at Sandro with my mom and my sister, who are both thin (my sister is a 2-4 and my mom is a 6). I've conditioned myself not to engage with stores and boutiques especially, so I was standing back and just helping them. But one of the sales associates approached me and said, \"I think this piece would look really good on you. Let me grab a couple of pieces for you that I think would work.\" I was really taken aback, since Sandro is not a store I would consider generous in its sizing. But she took the time to help me and devote energy to me instead of my mom and sister, who would have an easy time buying clothes there. She did find a few pieces that worked and I ended up buying two of them, when otherwise I probably wouldn't have bought anything. She made me feel like a part of the process and included in that environment, which was so touching that it really took me aback.  It seems only natural for you to design your own clothing line next. Do you have plans or desires to do that? I'm working on something now... This interview has been edited and condensed. "

And here's why starting to save more right now, instead of a decade from now, will make getting there significantly easier. 12. How much you have saved for retirement. OK, cool, you've been diligently contributing to your 401(k). Somewhere out there you may have an IRA or two. (And you might want to look into rolling over these balances into fewer accounts.) The important thing is to know how much you've saved and how much you still need to. So, go on. Dig up your passwords. Crunch the numbers. Or link your accounts in the free LearnVest Money Center and we'll show you. 13. How to manage budget-busting friends. If you were duped by them in your 20s, shame on them. If you're still letting it happen in your 30s, shame on you. By this age, you should know who they are and how they operate. While you may love their sense of humor or style, you may hate how empty your wallet is after you hang out with them. It's about time you learned how to neutralize these culprits.

Discover how your Myers-Briggs quotient is affecting your finances. 15. That, the older you get, the more complex your money life becomes. \"A lot of my younger clients say, 'I'll be able to save more for retirement when I make more money,' but the truth is, as they start to make more money, they have way more financial obligations,\" says Taylor. \"They're not living in the shoebox apartment anymore. Then they get married, and they have a wedding to fund. Then they have kids, and they have college to save for.\" The bottom line? Today is the time to start, not tomorrow. 16. How your significant other handles money. By now, you probably know his favorite color, first pet and worst habit, but do you know how he thought about money growing up? Or exactly where she stands -- financially -- today? Here are six money questions to ask each other and a Love & Money Bootcamp to help you get on the same page. And, when you're ready, a financial plan to help you build the life you want together. 17. Where your parents stand financially. It's a rough role reversal, to be sure. After all, they were probably the ones who took care of you, but trust us, you'll be glad you had this conversation. Start by finding out how to access their account balances, health insurance and long-term care insurance. Then ask them these six money questions today.

The takeaway? Stop feeling like tomorrow is the time to tackle your financial burdens and take control of your money today. 26. That you never know the truth about other people's finances. The co-worker with great clothes could be deep in debt or have family money. The neighbor could be close to foreclosure or have paid cash for her house. That's why it's never wise to compare yourself to other people. RELATED: How to Cure Your Money Comparisonitis 27. What not to do when you buy a new home. We all love to renovate.

Sure, spending less and saving more help, but there's no faster way to financial freedom than growing your income. Make sure that you're earning what you're worth.  35. What a will is -- and why you need one. By this point in life you need one ... or two. There are actually two kinds of wills: a last will and testament and a living will. Put simply, a last will and testament is a legal document that spells out what should happen to your possessions when you die. (And, yes, you have possessions.) A living will, on the other hand, is a health care directive for what should happen to you if you're unable to communicate your wishes. Guess what? You need both.

That cashing out your 401(k) may hurt you. Now and later. You already know that pulling money out of your 401(k) sets you back years and years when it comes to retiring, right? But guess what: You'll also have a huge tax bill to pay the next April. Plus, you're more likely to plunder your account again. That's another reason it's important to have an emergency fund. (In addition to not cashing out, steer clear of 401(k) loans that let you borrow against your retirement savings and pay it back -- with interest.) RELATED: Learn It: Your 401(k) Is Not a Bank!  38. The ins and outs of interest. Simple interest is a percentage multiplied by the amount and the length of time you promise to pay it back (if we're talking about a loan -- or, if we're talking about a simple savings account, the length of the time that you leave the money there, untouched). Compound interest, on the other hand, is calculated more frequently so that it builds upon itself to make interest grow continually. Here's how it can help and hurt you. 39.

Whether you're 10 and saving for a new bike, or 60 and knocking on the door of retirement, it's never too late (or too early) to get your ducks in a row. Read on for advice on how to plan for the future -- no matter how old you are. Baby: Ten fingers? Ten toes? You're set. Sit tight, be cute, and let your crazy aunts coo over you. There's nothing to worry about here -- especially if your parents have already started a savings fund for you. 10: Want to buy something that your parents won't approve of? Sure you do. Ask for allowance, do chores and then blow your money on a new game or toy. [More from Manilla.com: 7 Personal Budget Alterations to Build Your Nest Egg] 15: Your parents still take care of you, but maybe they're not paying for everything anymore. Time to stash away some money into your savings account and talk to your parents about creating a budget. You should probably get a summer job, too. 18: You're independent now (sort of). While Mom and Dad might be helping you out with necessary expenses, like rent or college tuition, you still need to have money for books, pizza and weekend fun. Now's the time to start creating good habits, like minimal credit card spending and paying your bills on time. 22: Get a (real) job, rent an apartment, and prepare to start paying back your student loans. You might think that there's not enough money leftover to contribute to your 401(k), but you're wrong. Start saving now so you don't hate yourself later. 25: Begin establishing good credit by opening up a couple of low-interest credit cards and paying them back on time. You're in a good spot to save right now: You've got a steady income, no kids and no mortgage. You don't know this yet, but you'll never be as free as you are right now. Keep up the good work, and don't get shackled by debt. [More from Manilla.com: Marie Claire & Manilla: Rainy Day Savings Fund] 30s: Time to up the ante. If you're not already, begin contributing to your 401(k). Make sure you're contributing the maximum amount that your employer will match (because it's free money). You should also look into buying a house, but only if you're willing to stay in it for at least three to five years because that's how long it will take to redeem your buying and selling costs. And, start diversifying your portfolio. A simple rule is to take your age and subtract it by 110. The resulting number is roughly the percentage you should invest in stocks and the rest should be in bonds or cash. 40s: College! Only this time, it's not for you. Prepare for your kids' tuition costs now, but make sure you're not halting your retirement planning or taking out costly loans, like a home equity line of credit. A good option is to enroll in your state's 529 Savings Plan, which provides key tax benefits and reduces the burden of saving for college on your own. Visit saveforcollege.com to learn more. 50s: Over the hill? Not you! You've got tons of mileage left, so start looking into long-term care options. They're the least expensive at this age and you'll be most likely to qualify because you won't have a pre-existing health condition. Because you'll be living longer, make sure you're taking advantage of catch-up contributions to your 401(k) and IRA. You can now contribute up to $5,500. 60: Did you hear? Sixty is the new 50 and you're looking good. Now is the time to take things down a notch. Dial back your investment risks so that the majority of your wealth is in a combination of bonds and cash. Also, stick it to the man and start looking for independent work that allows you more freedom and can act as an income source into retirement. 62: Hey, old guy, you did it! Welcome to retirement -- age, that is. Just because you've hit 62 doesn't mean you have to start collecting Social Security. If you can, hold off for a while. Waiting until you're 70 to start collecting will give you almost double the monthly benefit. The exception? If you're in poor health or in desperate need of income. [More from Manilla.com: You Can Completely Change the Way You Manage Your Money in 4 Steps] 70: Make sure your retirement fund lasts by downsizing your home or moving to a cheaper area. You'll be able to maintain your lifestyle for longer and possibly live in your dream location. 75: You might be old, but there's still some planning to do. It's time to consider your legacy. Establish a lifetime income by drastically reducing your stock ownership and transferring the funds into a combination of income producing assets, like bonds (domestic, foreign and corporate), Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and annuities. All ages: Whether you're 18 and need money for bail, or 80 and your home is struck by a natural disaster, it's essential to have an emergency savings fund so that your head is always above water.

      "text": "Although the economic literature, pundit bloviating and ideological rants, love to ask how to pay for Social Security, they are all asking the wrong question. The right question is \"what is the Social Security Multiplier?\" The multiplier measures how much the national income goes up, or gets cut, by a given government expense or policy. By convention, if the multiplier is  What is Social Security's Multiplier effect then? Well, AARP has a study that makes it clear: \"A new report from AARP, in fact, shows that every $1 paid out by Social Security generates, in turn, about $2 of total output for the U.S. economy -- or nearly $1.4 trillion in 2012.\" Read the rest here. So, this means that there is a net GAIN for every dollar spent on Social Security and, though this is somewhat controversial, it may be as high as double the input. Seen that way, we ought to fund SS unless the funding would cost us more than double the amount spent -- say, with a 100 percent interest rate AND a government that did not have the right and ability to \"coin money.\" Since the U.S. has essentially an unlimited ability to borrow money, and at rates close to zero -- not 100 percent! -- there really is no question that we ought to do that.  This is quite apart from the moral and societal impact of having millions of impoverished seniors that family members -- often in their prime earning years -- and over-stressed private institutions, from churches to soup kitchens, would struggle to care for. We've been there and done that, before we had Social Security. It was mass poverty of seniors, well beyond the ability of the institutions of a hundred years ago, that caused FDR to create Social Security in the first place. The need for Social Security really ought to be beyond debate now. However, for those who still require proof, and who are not so blinded by theo-economic beliefs that nothing will convince them, the National Bureau of Economic Research says: Elderly poverty in the U.S. decreased dramatically during the 20th century. Between 1960 and 1995, the official poverty rate of those aged 65 and above fell from 35 percent to 10 percent, and research has documented similarly steep declines dating back to at least 1939. While poverty was once far more prevalent among the elderly than among other age groups, today's elderly have a poverty rate similar to that of working-age adults and much lower than that of children. Social Security is often mentioned as a likely contributor to the decline in elderly poverty. Enacted in 1935, the Social Security system experienced rapid benefit growth in the post-WWII era. In fact, there is a striking association between the rise in Social Security expenditures per capita and the decline in elderly poverty See the full report here. Social Security works. It does what it was designed to do, and although this was not the concern when it was set up, it actually boosts the national output above what it distributes. It is a win-win-win. Of course, from an economic standpoint, a separate issue is whether a truly sovereign government ought to borrow its own currency at all. This gets into whether we want to support a growing (in wealth) class of idle rent-seekers, both at home and abroad. At home, the issue becomes whether these institutions that seek rent of our money to us, actually put more back into the economy than they take out. This is the banking sector and institutional bond buyers. Well, though some of these bond buyers are funds that do support pensioners, who, like Social Security recipients, spend more into the economy than they take out, there are more direct ways to do this, like Social Security. How about this? We stop borrowing our sovereign money, eliminate the deadweight Social Security payroll tax altogether, which is 12.4 percent (half employee, half employer, typically), and simply fund social security payouts directly with debt-free money. Since we would be now saving money by cutting out bond-buying middlemen and paying interest payments to banks, and since we know seniors' demand for goods and services produces more national income than it takes out (see above), why not give seniors a raise while we're at it? The cost of living for that group has consistently outpaced general inflation and payments have not kept up.  While we should never spend all out dollars on any particular group, a dollar spent on seniors seems like a remarkably good deal and should be funded with debt/interest-free sovereign money.  "

      "text": "This article, written by Simon Moore, CFA, MBA, was contributed by Manilla.com, the leading, free and secure service that lets you manage all of your bills and accounts in one place. _____ Anyone who wants to cover the cost of living during her golden years should be thinking about IRAs, or individual retirement accounts, just as much as she's nursing her employer-sponsored 401(k)s. Both types of retirement savings accounts are pretty complicated, and in the face of complexity, people often make bad choices. That's a shame. With a little clarity, investors can save a thousand dollars in taxes if they just meet a few basic requirements. Those include your age, income and how and when they plan to use the money. Here are two ideas to help you choose the right IRA. Roth IRAs: A Way to Save for a First Home or Education Although the \"R\" in IRA stands for retirement, a so-called Roth IRA can sometimes be used for other goals. That is, you don't necessarily have to wait until you're 59.5 years old to withdraw the money without penalty. That's because the money in a Roth IRA can be used tax-free just five years after the account is opened, as long as it's put toward a first home (up to $10,000) or certain educational expenses. The money grows in a Roth IRA grows tax free. Of course, you do pay tax on any contributions you make to a Roth IRA, so there aren't the immediate tax advantages of a traditional IRA, but the money is tax free when it's withdrawn if the conditions are met. If you're already on track for retirement through your 401(k), but have other savings goals, like a house purchase or further education, then a Roth IRA may be good to consider. For example, by making the maximum contribution for four years and earning six percent on your investments, you could easily save yourself $1,000 in taxes on the withdrawals. One caveat: For the 2013 tax year, if your income exceeds $188,000 if married filing jointly, or $127,000 if you're single or the head of a household, then you likely aren't eligible to contribute to a Roth IRA given income limits. Traditional IRAs: Grow Your Tax Refund by More Than $1,000 People who earn less than $69,000 as a single tax filer (or $115,000 on a joint filing) may be able to contribute as much as $5,500 to a traditional IRA for the 2013 tax year. That amount increases to $6,500 if you're over 50 -- though contribution eligibility stops at 70.5. That contribution is tax deductible, so it can lower your taxable income, meaning you get a bigger refund or write a smaller check to the IRS. You won't get the full amount deducted from your taxes, but if you're in the 25 percent tax bracket, say, you could get $1,375 off taxes by making a $5,500 contribution and meeting all the requirements. The drawbacks are it should be money you plan on using in retirement, and you will pay tax on the money as income when you withdraw it. So there is a tax benefit here for some folks, but only if you really are in a position to put the money toward retirement savings. IRAs are complicated, so seek professional advice and consult the IRS documents to make sure you qualify and understand the conditions, many of which can't be covered here. (For example, the Exxon Valdez settlement income, airline payments or Kate Bailey Hutchinson spousal IRAs all deserve their own articles...) Finally, remember you can't have it both ways when it comes to Roth and traditional IRAs. The total contribution limit to all IRAs is fixed, so any dollars that go into a Roth IRA reduce what you can put into a traditional IRA, and vice versa. Also, you can't contribute more to an IRA than your taxable compensation for the year. That said, IRAs do offer real tax savings to many Americans. For most tax filers, the deadline for IRA contributions is Tuesday, April 15, so get moving if you haven't already committed to your IRA!

      "text": " With tax season upon us, taxpayers are not the only ones preparing for tax filing day. The Internal Revenue Service warns consumers that there are sophisticated scams targeting taxpayers throughout the country. You cannot let your guard down because scammers are staging a multimedia assault using email, phone, fax, websites, and/or mailed notices posing as the IRS. Many scams use the IRS name and logo that make communications appear authentic. Some tempt the victim with refunds while others threaten penalties including loss of driver's license or loss of business. The end goal is typically the same. The scammer wants to trick you into revealing your personal or financial information -- including Social Security number, bank account number, credit/debit card number -- in order to steal your identity or money. Here are a few tips on typical scams and what you need to know so you can stay in good graces with Uncle Sam, and steer clear of Uncle Scam. Phone Scam The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) said it has received more than 20,000 complaints, in the past eight months, from people who have collectively paid more than $1 million to scammers. \"This scam has hit taxpayers in nearly every state in the country,\" said IRS Acting Commissioner Danny Werfel. How it works: Fake IRS agents call you demanding payment by prepaid debit card or wire transfer. The caller often masks his caller ID, making it look like the call is coming from the IRS. In some cases, the caller knows the last four digits of Social Security numbers and follows up with official-looking emails. What you need to know: Real IRS agents usually initiate contact by mail and never demand payment by debit card, credit card or wire transfer. If you receive a call, ask for a call back number and employee badge number. You should contact the IRS at 1-800-829-1040 to verify the contact and determine if the IRS has a legitimate need to contact you. Phishing Scam Using Email and/or Fake Website How it works: Phishing scams usually begin with an unsolicited email with a link to a fake website that looks very authentic. The scammer tries to get you to send or enter your valuable personal and financial information online permitting identity theft. What you need to know: The IRS does not send unsolicited emails to taxpayers and never asks for your personal information via email, text message or social media. The official IRS website is www.irs.gov. Do not be confused or misled by sites claiming to be the IRS but ending in .com, .net, .org or other designations other than .gov. Watch this IRS video about phishing. Cyber criminals are becoming more sophisticated and scams more pervasive. It is critical to stay alert so that you do not become a victim. Remember to keep your antivirus software up-to-date and be careful of what you click. This post originally appeared at the Runnymede Blog. Have you been a target of identity theft or tax scams?

      "text": "Collecting points, bonuses, and other rewards by using a rewards credit card can be exciting, fun, and addicting. However, there are many ways to rack up the points without making extra purchases, whether you're looking for cash back, travel miles, or other perks. The trick is in finding ways to turn normal, non-credit card expenses end up as point-earning purchases on the card. Here are a few ways to do it, but with a warning that some of the methods require discipline or could lead to added spending and bigger balances. Do the unthinkable, but carefully In general, it can be a very bad practice to charge consumable items like groceries, gas, and other regular purchases on rewards credit cards, unless those expenses are being paid in full each month. The problem isn't that charging groceries or paying the electric bill with a credit card is inherently worse than charging an emergency purchase or something similar. The issue lies in poor planning and overspending because the cash which would have been used for groceries or other consumables gets allocated elsewhere after those expenses get charged to the card. With a good system, the money for the consumables gets paid toward the card each month. If you want to earn extra reward points on your credit card by putting regular budget items onto it, open a separate, free savings account just for those budget items. By setting a budget and limit each month, you'll know how much you can put on the card, and you'll have the money handy to pay off the expenses each month. You won't earn any real interest on the money, but you'll earn reward points, and having the account ready to cover the expenses will help you stay organized.  'Let me have the check!' With this strategy, you pay for group purchases, such as a shared dinner bill, on your card, and everyone else hands over their cash to you. The money is dutifully applied toward the card's payment for the month, reward points were collected on the purchase, and no extra money was spent. Look for opportunities to make bigger purchases for friends who are paying cash for vacations, gadgets, home goods, lawnmowers, and the like. If you offer some kind of reward for their help (cooking dinner, helping around the house or with fixing things) you might be more likely to turn some of those friends into loyal helpers in your quest for rewards points. Charge Peter to pay Paul Another strategy to earn more credit card rewards points that can be dangerous is to use the card to pay off other credit card bills. Most often, this is done by using checks attached to the card, which are usually associated with the highest fees and are the last to have payments applied toward the principal. People tend to get into trouble by using one card to pay another because, often, they're doing it because they are already in or near financial distress, and they fail to catch up with the payments. However, if you are organized, disciplined, have ample income, and want to earn rewards points in a big way, then this strategy can be a winner, as long as using one card to pay another doesn't lead to more spending, less saving, and bigger balances growing on any of the credit cards.

The reason: Despite all the \"regulations\" in the Dodd Frank Financial \"reform\" and the Volcker Rule and The Fed's \"oversight,\" the banks seems to have free reign to do what they will despite the financial crisis, and the pathetic \"recovery.\"  There have been fines and settlements, but nothing is settled. None of them have or will go to jail. Economic conditions continue to stress out millions even as the Fed announces \"stress tests\" that appear on the surface to be a way of insuring that big banks won't need more bailouts.  Sad to say, it's more of the charade. Partially that's because the banks dominate the Federal Reserve, a private, not public, institution.  And, partially, because when it comes to economic crises, the stories are buried in the business pages and rarely surface as topics of concern on popular talk shows and media that most folks watch. Even the financial channels like CNBC prefer superficial soundbite chatter to in-depth-interviews according to \"Money Honey,\" Maria Bartiromo who publicly criticized her old network when she took a better deal at Fox.  Many of us have seen the reports that Citibank, the biggest enchilada of finance, the bank that provided refuge to the likes of Clinton's Treasury Secretary Robert \"the great deregulator\" Rubin, and Obama Budget director, whiz kid Peter Orzag, who has been in Court lately hiding how much he made from Citi in a divorce proceeding, is in trouble. Citi failed the Fed's latest Stress test designed to see if it had adequate reserves to withstand the widely anticipated next financial jolt to the economy. Washingtons Blog quotes the business news honchos at Bloomberg and then adds context: Citigroup Inc.'s capital plan was among five that failed Federal Reserve stress tests, while Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of America Corp. passed only after reducing their requests for buybacks and dividends. In reality, Citi \"flat lined\" -- went totally bust -- in 2008. It was insolvent. And former FDIC chief Sheila Bair said that the whole bailout thing was really focused on bringing a very dead Citi back from the grave. Indeed, \"the big banks -- including Citi -- have repeatedly gone bankrupt.\" Why didn't I read that in the news? Didn't Citi \"pass\" earlier tests? I thought they were stronger than ever. Think again, says Washington: So why did the U.S. government give Citi a passing grade in previous stress tests? Because they were rigged to give all of the students an \"A\". That's one good reason for all of us to be stressed, because we can have absolutely no confidence in the stability of our economy, whatever they say about how it's all getting better. Here's James Kwak of BaselineScenario.com, on the stress test story. He sees it as one more financial fraud: Despite the much-publicized black eye to Citigroup's management, the bottom line of the Federal Reserve's stress tests is that every other large U.S. bank will be allowed to pay out more cash to its shareholders, either as increased dividends or stock buybacks. And pay out more cash they will: at least $22 billion in increased dividends (that includes all the banks subject to stress tests), plus increased buyback plans. Rather than just speculate with my own, I believe, well grounded, if cynical suspicions, let me quote a few more experts like Mike Harrison, an expert on Credit Write Downs who wrote earlier: I would say the stress tests were a mock exercise to instill confidence in the capital markets. This was important first and foremost because it would induce private investors to pay for bank recapitalization instead of taxpayers. But it was also important for the economy as a whole as the sick banking sector was dragging the whole economy down. The key, however, is that the tests were a mock exercise. Despite the additional capital, banks are still hiding hundreds of billions of dollars in losses in level three, hold to maturity, and off balance sheet asset pools. If asset prices fall and/or the economy weakens, all of this subterfuge would be for nought. He quotes Mike Konzcal who did his own line-by-line assessment of the actual numbers the banks report on earlier tests. He noted that banks often have to worry about several liens on the properties they have financed and hold mortgages on. So the original loss from second-liens, as reported by the stress tests, was $68.4 billion for the four largest banks. If you look at those numbers again, and assume a loss of 40% to 60%, numbers that are not absurd by any means, you suddenly are talking a loss of between $190 billion and $285 billion. Which means if the stress tests were done with terrible 2nd lien performance in mind, there would have been an extra $150 billion dollar hole in the balance sheet of the four largest banks. Major action would have been taken against the four largest banks if this was the case. Are you still with me? What comes to mind is the old adage: \"What a web we weave when first we practice to deceive.\" Why are they doing this?  Here's Harrison again, from his posts on the authoritative website, Naked Capitalism:  The real question is: why is the Obama Administration running victory laps, unrolling the 'Mission Accomplished' banner on the credit crisis, as Mike Konczal describes it? I suspect this is just a political stunt to provide cover in the mid-term elections to somehow demonstrate that the Democrats fixed the problem that the Republicans created.  Now, do you see why we should be stressed too? News Dissector Danny Schechter edits Mediachannel.org and blogs at newsdissector.net.

      "text": "You probably know that your credit report and credit score are important pieces of your financial puzzle. You do know that, right? Of course you do! Keeping an eye on your credit report can alert you to fraudulent use of your credit. You can also see if there are any mistakes appearing which could seriously hurt your credit. Watching your credit score lets you know whether your credit activity is helping or hurting your credit. Have you ever checked your credit score or applied for credit only to find your score wasn't quite what you thought it was? What do you do? You start to look at your spending and accounts to see where your credit leaks are happening. Last thing you need is something sabotaging your credit. You're probably watching obvious items like your credit cards, and making payments on time, but there might be some forgotten items causing problems with your credit, and dragging down your score. These little things can be easily over-looked since they aren't regular charges you would see and be used to. But if you forget about them they can have huge effects on your credit. Here Are 5 Forgotten Items That Might Be Blowing Up Your Credit 1. Improperly Canceled Gym Membership You don't want to go to the gym? Simple. Just cancel the automatic withdrawal from your account, and stop going. If only. This is a good way to find yourself in credit trouble. Most gyms have very specific cancelation policies. These policies usually require you to come in and fill out paperwork or at least require something in writing. If you don't, then you aren't canceled. The result is that you are still supposed to be making monthly membership payments -- but you aren't. The gym reports your delinquent amount to a credit bureau, and your credit score is tanked.  Sometimes even if you go through the right steps it still can take a billing cycle or two for your cancelation to go through. Make sure you follow the exact policies for canceling with the gym. Keep an eye on the account you have attached to your membership to make sure your account is cancelled properly. 2. Parking Tickets Sometimes, when you see a parking ticket, it gets tossed into the glove box and forgotten. Or you get it home and you don't think about it since most of your bills are online these days. You might just forget what the due date is if it's not clearly written on the ticket. Whatever the reason though you can believe the city or organization that issued that parking ticket won't forget about it! Forget about that ticket too long and local scofflaw practices could get you reported to a credit bureau (and also get your car booted or towed). Even if it isn't reported the ticket could find its way to a collection agency if it isn't paid and that could hit a credit bureau. (Of course you could also be racking up additional fees on the ticket as well.) Take care of any tickets you get ASAP. If you aren't going to fight it then pay it. It's not worth the trouble with your car and the potential hit to your credit to play around. 3. Library Fines Not all libraries report fines for overdue books to the credit bureaus. Some do, though. Others might just hand your overdue fees to a collection agency. If you haven't paid your library fine, and if the library reports it, you could see a drop in your credit score. Items like this appear under your payment history, and since payment history is the most important aspect of your credit score, it makes a huge difference in what your score ultimately ends up being. Don't let the relatively small amount a library fee usually is do major damage to your credit. 4. Forgotten Utility Balances When you move to a new house, you might still end up with a small amount to pay on your utility bill at the old place. This is more common when you move somewhere and switch utility providers. When it's the same provider they'll usually just tack on any difference to your next bill at the new house. But when you switch providers a partial billing cycle might be involved, so you might not fully realize that you still owe on your utilities. If you didn't provide your address, or if you aren't paying attention, you might not see the notice that you still owe money. After a few months, the utility company will likely turn the account over to collections, and that will show up as a big negative on your credit report. Imagine getting a bad hit on your credit for a couple of days worth of electricity?  Make sure you forward your mailing address with the post office in case a lingering bill still exists. It's also a good idea to follow up with any old utility companies to make sure you are paid in full. 5. Unpaid Medical Bills Are you putting off paying your high-cost medical bills? If you are, that could turn into a credit disaster. Health care providers and insurers report your payment delinquencies to credit bureaus, and that can affect your score. If you find yourself unable to pay, contact the provider and make other arrangements. Keeping quiet and pretending the bill doesn't exist won't make it go away. It only makes it worse. Be honest with the provider. Many are willing to work with you, and you don't have to get the credit bureaus involved. Bottom Line These non-credit items can end up causing you credit score issues. While making your payments faithfully on the above items won't help your credit score, missing payments, or defaulting on your account, can severely damage your credit score. Make sure you are paying all of your obligations. And when you cancel a service or subscription, verify that you have followed all of the proper steps.  Don't let one stray bill or small fee blow up your credit! "

      "text": "If the thought of extreme couponing drives you crazy but grocery prices wipe out your budget, maybe it's time to try a different type of store. A three-way comparison by Cheapism.com examined retailers with three different models for selling groceries: Kroger, a traditional grocery store and umbrella brand for chains across the U.S.; Walmart, a big-box multinational that tallies more than half its sales from groceries; and Aldi, a German-owned discount grocery chain with a foothold in 32 U.S. states. We found that Aldi, with its bare-bones approach and emphasis on store brands, is easily the cheapest grocery store overall. Cheapism visited one location for each store in the Columbus, Ohio, area and priced 37 products from a variety of departments. We chose identical items (brand and size) whenever possible and like items otherwise. Aldi does not carry well-known brands but stocks in-house labels, so we checked out a selection of store brands at Kroger and Walmart, as well. Where sizes differed, we determined a unit price and then figured a per-item price for the same quantity at all three stores.  Aldi - Photo by Cheapism Aldi emerged the cheapest by far. The shopping cart total came to just $72.30, besting Walmart by more than $13 and Kroger by more than $21 (before savings with the Kroger Plus Card). Aldi keeps prices low by cutting expenses to the bone. Shoppers bag their own groceries with bags brought from home and deposit a quarter to use a cart (the change is refunded when the cart is returned). Store hours are limited (forget about 24/7 shopping) as is the selection of items -- about 5 percent of the inventory found in a traditional grocery store. The model seems to be working, however, and Aldi claims many fans, including Private Label Store Brands magazine, which recently named the chain Retailer of the Year for 2014. Shoppers we interviewed said the store brands are comparable in taste and quality to brands carried by the big-name grocery retailers, and the shopping experience is very customer-friendly.  Still, Aldi displays a few flaws. The lean selection is too spare for some consumers -- no deli, for example, nearly all in-house brands, and often just one size of a product -- and the quality of produce and canned and package goods disappoints others. At present, the chain operates about 1,300 locations.  Walmart - Photo by Cheapism.com Walmart should serve frugal shoppers well in the absence of an Aldi. The items in Cheapism's shopping cart, which included mostly store brands, totaled $85.88. The mega-discount retailer maintains a price-matching policy that honors competitors' advertised prices on identical items (brand, contents, and quantity) at the register. The policy covers other grocery stores' preferred shopping card discounts, helping solidify a price edge over Kroger. Walmart holds a particular advantage when it comes to brand-name items: 20 out of 26 cost less than they did at Kroger (19 when accounting for loyalty card prices).  Consumers offer a mixed appraisal of the Walmart store brand Great Value. A Cheapism Facebook poll revealed that many frugal shoppers consider the brand satisfactory, and Walmart was the clear leader when respondents ranked the three retailers on quality and overall value. But reviews posted elsewhere online are less complimentary about the in-house label, and some note that produce often looks wilted and generally unappetizing.   Kroger - Photo by Cheapism.com Kroger was the most expensive grocery store in the sample, with a receipt total of $93.73 -- more than $21 higher than Aldi. When Kroger Plus Card prices were factored in, the bottom line dropped to $86.78 (a savings of $6.95) -- still more expensive than the competition but inching close to Walmart. Kroger's loyalty card program offers rewards in the form of lower prices on groceries and on fuel when filling up at a Kroger pump or select gas stations. Customers can earn as much as $1 off each gallon of gasoline on one purchase up to 35 gallons. Selection at Kroger is slightly better than what Cheapism found at Walmart and definitely superior to Aldi. For example, Kroger was the only chain that maintained fresh meat and seafood counters. In-house brands, including the Kroger Value label (the retailer's low-price brand), garner accolades from frugal shoppers and experts. Trade publication Private Label Store Brands named Kroger its 2013 Retailer of the Year. Consumers we spoke to also commend the shopping experience, a factor that earned Kroger more points than Walmart and Aldi in this grocery store face-off.  Bottom Line: Shoppers who choose a grocery store on price alone will head to Aldi, which boasts decent store brands and a unique format that makes for cheap, no-nonsense shopping. Walmart stands out for certain price advantages and inventory that extends far beyond groceries, while Kroger's strong suit is the overall shopping experience and generous loyalty program.

      "text": "If you're a history buff, you might remember a period of American history called the \"free banking era,\" or the \"era of wildcat banking,\" that took place in the decades before the Civil War. During that period, state banks were allowed to issue their own currencies without any federal regulation. Many of those banks operated on the frontier of the American West, some of them in remote places inhabited only by \"wildcats\" (hence the name) and engaged in some loose accounting practices. Quite often these fly-by-night operations went out of business, either as a result of fraud, incompetence or bad market conditions. In any case, the result was the same: The bank's customers found themselves holding wads of worthless bills, since the FDIC wasn't around in those days to bail them out. Well, folks, the era of wildcat banking has returned with a vengeance, only now it's taken on an electronic form. It's called Bitcoin. The past month has been hectic for Bitcoin investors as they've watched the Bitcoin economy erupt in chaos. It's either tragic or comic, depending on whether you actually own bitcoins. Things started to go haywire on February 24, when Mt. Gox, the world's largest Bitcoin exchange went offline. Several days later, it filed for bankruptcy as the company claimed that it had lost more than $470 million worth of bitcoins -- including both company money and depositor accounts -- to theft by hackers (oops). Mt. Gox's young CEO, the doughy-faced Frenchman Mark Karpeles, held a press conference in Tokyo, where he meekly apologized for causing \"inconvenience.\" Afterwards, he scurried off into hiding as angry customers protested outside the Mt. Gox office.  The Mt. Gox debacle only got worse on March 20, when the company announced that it had mysteriously found another hundred million or so in bitcoins that were apparently just sitting around in electronic storage. This discovery leads some to wonder whether Mt. Gox's losses resulted from actual hacking, internal fraud or sheer ineptitude. Regardless, the incident doesn't inspire a lot of confidence in Mt. Gox's management team. And bad news just keeps rolling in from other regions of the Bitcoin world: a \"Bitcoin bank\" called FlexCoin, shut down on March 3 after hackers drained its reserves. A day later, the Bitcoin exchange Poloniex announced that it, too, had lost customer deposits after a hack attack.  Meanwhile, a new subplot developed in the Bitcoin drama when Newsweek published a story on March 6 claiming that it had found the true identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, the elusive inventor of Bitcoin who dropped out of sight in 2011. The debate about the accuracy of the Newsweek story rages on, but it's really distracting us from the main point: Is Bitcoin feasible as either a currency or an investment?  We've heard a lot about the possible benefits of Bitcoin. First, Bitcoin cuts out financial middlemen. Bitcoin purchases can be made directly between parties without the aid of banks, credit card companies, or wire services. Second, Bitcoin will supposedly free the world economy from the interference of meddling governments that manipulate currency for political ends. This last consideration has earned Bitcoin such a rabid following among Libertarians, Anarchists, Crypto-Anarchists, Cypherpunks, political dissidents, gold bugs and other malcontents distrustful of the world banking system. Recent events, however, have shown that the entire concept of Bitcoin contains fatal flaws -- flaws that can't be resolved with mere tweaks in Bitcoin's software code. Here are a few to begin with: 1. Bitcoin faces massive security problems. Since the Bitcoin currency network can function only through \"peer-to-peer\" software, it's vulnerable to hacking attacks. Hackers stole bitcoins from Mt. Gox by exploiting a Bitcoin loophole known as \"transaction malleability.\" Apparently, the thief (or thieves) made it appear as though a transaction didn't go through, causing Mt. Gox's servers to keep resending Bitcoins automatically until its reserves were emptied. Mt. Gox experienced similar attacks in 2011, yet didn't take any measures to fix the problem. This is only one crack in Bitcoin's structure. Undoubtedly, hackers will search relentlessly for new ones. 2. Bitcoin's value is insanely volatile. In the past year alone, Bitcoin's price has fluctuated wildly, more so than any modern currency. In March of 2013, it sold for roughly 47 U.S. dollars. By December 4, 2013 it had climbed to about $1,117, and then fell to $539 on December 18, 2013. Even if Bitcoin survives its current tribulations, this volatility makes it unsuitable as a currency. How can you count on Bitcoin as a long term store of value, when its price never seems to stabilize?  3. Bitcoin is backed by nothing but the goodwill of its users. In the past, the U.S. dollar was backed by gold -- that is, each dollar was redeemable for a certain amount of gold. That system vanished decades ago, but the value of the dollar and other national currencies are still guaranteed by the laws of national governments. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is a fabricated currency, made of nothing but strings of software code floating through the ghostly ether of cyberspace. 4. Bitcoin currently has no insurance or government protections. Bank deposits in the U.S. are insured by the FDIC, credit union holdings are guaranteed by the NCUSIF, and securities are protected from fraud by the SIPC. Bitcoin owners, on the other hand, have no legal protections. The unlucky customers of Mt. Gox have most likely lost all their money. Some have filed lawsuits, but this could take years of costly litigation to recover any damages, let alone the full amount of the losses. Litigation is not a guarantee of recouping your money. And here's another problem: Bitcoin transactions, unlike credit card purchases, are irreversible. If you buy merchandise with bitcoins and the merchant fails to deliver, that money is now securely in his hands. There will be no third-party company to go to bat for you the way a credit card company might. 5. Bitcoin ownership is highly concentrated. Business Insider reports that \"47 individuals own 28.9 percent of the approximately 12 million Bitcoins in existence so far.\" With wealth concentrated in such a small number of hands, the Bitcoin market becomes susceptible to manipulation through hoarding or pump-and-dump schemes. Moreover, the process of creating bitcoins -- or \"mining\" them, as Bitcoin aficionados say -- depends on the use of high-powered software to solve complex cryptographic puzzles too complex for human computation. Each time a puzzle is solved, more bitcoins enter the money supply, and become the property of those who \"mined\" them. As time goes on, the puzzles become progressively more complicated, requiring more processing power to solve. That feature was built into the system by Bitcoin's anonymous creator (or creators) in order to limit the supply of bitcoins and guard against the inflation that plagues many currencies. In the early days of Bitcoin, the cryptographic puzzles could be solved with ordinary personal computers, but the puzzles have become so complex that they require specialized computer \"rigs\" that gobble up large amounts of electricity. This evolving complexity has unleashed a computational game of one-upmanship as Bitcoin miners strive to outdo each other in mining capacity. Today, the cost of equipment and electricity has made Bitcoin mining too expensive for small-time investors, turning it into the prerogative of a wealthy clique. This aspect in Bitcoin's design only magnifies the problem of wealth concentration. 6. Bitcoin faces the danger of obsolescence. Even as I write this, computer engineers are designing new and improved types of electronic currency: Ripple, Dogecoin, Namecoin, Litecoin, Peercoin, Quark and others yet to be revealed. Most likely, one of these will win out and supplant Bitcoin, just as VHS supplanted Betamax as the dominant VCR format in the 1980s. Bitcoin is too young to have gained a strong competitive advantage over its rivals. Its popularity depends on a fickle public. In the face of those difficulties, the Bitcoin faithful still keep buying Bitcoin and praising its virtues. That leads me to believe that the real appeal of Bitcoin is more emotional than rational. A case in point: a group called Arisebitcoin set up billboards in the San Francisco Bay area that read: \"The revolution has started... where do you stand?\" Cool! Why be a mere currency speculator when you can be a revolutionary? Everybody wants to get ahead of the curve, to ride the wave of the future, to jump on a trend before the rest of the world catches on. That's probably how early adopters of the Internet felt circa 1991. Yet the search for the Next Big Thing in finance sometimes causes us to let down our guard and make irrational decisions. That's what happened to the unlucky investors who stored their money with Mt. Gox. At least the old-time wildcat banks left their customers with some colorful paper banknotes for souvenirs. When Bitcoin disappears, they won't even get that much. "

      "text": "If you're carrying debts -- from student loans, credit cards, a car note or a mortgage -- you could probably tell me roughly how much you owe and at what interest rates you owe it. Thanks to the CARD Act, those of us who carry credit card debt now see how long it will take to pay it off on our monthly statements. It's likely, however, that most folks don't realize that by spending money on non-essentials, rather than paying off debt, you're paying a tax of sorts. Here's why. While in debt, purchases you make actually cost more than what you pay the merchant, and not just when you buy it with a credit card. The reason for this is because every time we buy something (and particularly when we buy things we don't need), we are forgoing the opportunity to pay off existing debt - given that, let's just assume that everything we buy is essentially costing us more than we think we're paying. Let's say you're carrying a $1,000 credit card balance at a 20% APR, and your issuer sets your minimum monthly payment at 2 percent -- which is $20. If you keep your monthly payment fixed at $20 a month until it's paid off, it will take you just over nine years and you'll have paid about $1,168 in interest. If you paid $21 a month instead, it would take you eight years and cost you about $1,005 in interest. (This is assuming you continue to pay down the debt, and do not add to it.) Just that extra $1 every month will save you a year of debt payments and $153. Each dollar that you don't pay over that fixed minimum payment ends up costing you so much more in the end. It's important to keep that in mind when buying things while carrying a balance. If an extra $1 a month can save $153 in the scenario above, what would an extra $5 a month (aka your Starbucks trip this morning) save you? How about an extra $70 a month (aka those great jeans you wanted, but maybe didn't need)? Buying items you don't need while carrying debt costs you more in the long run. It's disconcerting to consider your spending as a series of purchases earning interest charges from the moment you make them, as you are in our debt tax scenario. For people already carrying credit card debt, avoiding interest charges is one reason they often switch to using debit cards. But if you're not actively paring down your debts by making more than the minimum payments -- even on low-interest rate debts like student loans, which some borrowers extend out to 30 years -- you're increasing the time you carry those balances and, because of compound interest, the balances themselves. So what should you do? 1. Start Paying Off Debts Completely Whether it's paying off those debts with the highest interest rates -- or just the smallest debts to give you the motivation to carry on -- start paying down your balances. The longer you carry them, the more you owe. 2. Don't Let Your Credit Card Charges Become Invisible Spending Whether you switch to a debit card, begin using cash or simply sign up for text alerts to notify you of changes to your balances, make sure your spending is visible to you on a daily basis. If you wait until the statement arrives to know whether you can pay off the balance, it's already too late. 3. Consolidate Credit Card Balances If you qualify, consolidating your credit card balances on a low-interest rate credit card can reduce the amount your debt costs you by lowering the interest charges that accrue on your overall balance. You may want to consider a personal loan to consolidate debt as well -- these loans tend to carry lower interest rates than credit cards and have a fixed monthly payment and term. 4. Avoid Paying Consolidation or Consulting Fees Many consumers who find themselves mired in debt accrue more of it by paying fees to unscrupulous credit consolidators. Much what they will do for a fee you can do yourself by just taking the time to make a plan, pick up the phone, be assertive and untangle your finances. 5. Understand the Credit Effects It's a common credit misconception that carrying debt is good for your credit scores. In fact, carrying credit card debt can raise an important credit scoring stat -- your utilization ratio. This number is the percentage of debt you charge to your total credit limit. Take our $1,000 example from above. If you carry that balance on a credit card with a $2,000 limit, you have a utilization of 50 percent. To achieve the best credit score you can, it's important to keep this ratio under 30 percent, and 10 percent is even better. If you want to see where your utilization currently stands, you can see how it's affecting two of your credit scores for free using tools on Credit.com. When it comes to debt, there really are no free lunches. Indeed, it is always harder to get out of than it is to get into. The best thing you can do is to change your own thinking when it comes to money. When you are in debt, even the price tag has a price tag. "

      "text": "April 15 is inching perilously closer. Sooner or later, you're going to have to come to terms with burning an evening fishing through a bunch of paperwork and sorting out your financial life. Sounds exhilarating, doesn't it? But, as it is with most things, we live in a fortunate age. Thing is, the results of doing your taxes are actually pretty awesome -- you get money from the government like they're your grandmother on your birthday. It's just the process that is painful, except that part's not so painful anymore. If you haven't yet discovered the simplistic beauty of filing your taxes online, let me tell you, you're missing out. You plug numbers into an app, and the app makes math happen, and then you're done. It's wonderful, and there are a lot of services out there to choose from, no matter what kind of device you own.  Windows Phone - TaxCaster Even if you're on the go, you can still get an idea of what your refund is going to look like. Windows Phone owners can download TaxCaster for free -- it uses the same calculator as TurboTax, one of the most reputable e-file services running today. You won't be able to e-file with TaxCaster, but you can use it to play around with your deductions to figure out how you can get the biggest return. That way, you can sit down and e-file in one go, then start planning your ill-advised refund-fueled shopping splurge.  Windows 8 - MyTaxRefund Speaking of planning shopping trips, it helps to know exactly when that check is going to arrive. That's why there's MyTaxRefund, available for free on the Windows Store. After you e-file with any service (though TurboTax is favored), you can enter a few lines of basic information to find out the status of both your federal and state tax returns and, more importantly, when you can expect those refunds to arrive.  Android - H&R Block 1040EZ The dream is real, not only is e-filing possible, e-filing from a mobile device is also a go. You can get taxes done with minimal effort, from anywhere, at anytime. And it's even better with a mobile -- thanks to the camera, you can take pictures of your documents, like your W-2. The H&R Block 1040EZ app will grab all the information from that document and upload it to the calculator. From there, it's just a matter of rounding at the details and hitting send (OK, granted, the 'hitting send' part of e-filing usually takes 15 minutes and rifling through about 346 different consent forms and agreements, but anyway). Of course, you have to be eligible to file with a 1040EZ, but if you do, it doesn't get much easier than this app. Free audit support, which not every e-filing service offers, is also a nice addition.  iOS - TurboTax SnapTax If filing your taxes is about as simple as digging out your W-2, you need to get TurboTax SnapTax. You get TurboTax, which has a pretty solid reputation, along with the promise that you'll be able to e-file in as quickly as ten minutes. Ten minutes, and you're done with taxes. What a world we live in. All you need to do is get in those personal details and snap a picture of your W-2. Beautiful and elegant in its simplicity, and it also results in you getting a nice big direct deposit not too long after you e-file (using the app!).  Mac - TurboTax For more complex returns, mobile's not going to work too well. Fortunately for Mac users, TurboTax has adapted their online software, turning it into a detailed, accurate app for e-file preparation. Like the online service, the TurboTax app will guide you through all parts of tax preparation and e-filing, including your work income, investments, and assets. Figuring out your deductions is just as straightforward, with TurboTax turning tax prep into a series of simple questions. You'll still have to pay to e-file, depending on which version of TurboTax you need, but it's still probably going to end up cheaper than paying someone else to do your taxes.

      "text": "There are 56,956 personal finance books on Amazon.com. In aggregate, they contain more than 3 billion words. This seems absurd, because 99 percent of personal finance can be summarized in nine words: Work a lot, spend a little, invest the difference. Master that, and the other 2.999 billion words are filler. The most important finance topics don't require details. Most can be, and should be, summarized in a sentence or two. Here are some I've learned. 1. Dollar-cost average for your entire life and you'll beat almost everyone who doesn't. 2. Only invest in products and companies you can explain to a six-year old. 3. Every five to seven years, people forget that recessions occur every five to seven years. 4. You're twice as biased as you think you are (four times if you disagree with that statement).  5. Read more books and fewer articles. 6. Read more history and fewer forecasts. 7. It's strange that you go to the doctor once a year, but check your investments once a day. 8. Be careful when reading about how stupid investors can be and not realize you're reading about yourself. 9. Your circle of competence is probably 90 percent smaller than you think it is. 10. You're only diversified when some of your investments perform worse than others. 11. Big risks will always be disregarded; small risks always blown out of proportion. 12. Check your brokerage account as infrequently as it takes to prevent rash decisions. 13. When in doubt, choose the investment with the lowest fee. 14. Emotional intelligence is more important than book intelligence. 15. The more you learn about the economy, the more you realize you have no idea what's going on. 16. Start saving for college before your kid is born, and start saving for your retirement before you graduate college. You'll feel silly when you start and like a genius when you finish. 17. The most powerful way to grow your money is learning to live with less, since you have complete control over it. 18. Singer Rihanna nearly went broke and fired her financial adviser, who described her situation well: \"Was it really necessary to tell her that if you spend money on things, you will end up with the things and not the money?\" 19. You have no obligation to have an opinion about anything.  20. You have a strict obligation to not have an opinion about things you don't understand.  21. No one attending private school should be on student loans. Most should utilize community and state schools, which provide just as good an education for a fraction of the price.  22. You shouldn't feel strongly about any investment you haven't spent at least a week thinking about. 23. Holding 60 percent of your assets in stocks and 40 percent in bonds isn't perfect for everyone; but I can think of a thousand worse strategies. 24. Respect the role luck has played on some of your role models.  25. Don't take out $100,000 in student loans for anything other than medical school (if that). 26. Change your mind as often as the facts change.  27. Ignore people who refuse to change theirs when the facts change.  28. Read last year's market predictions and you'll never again take this year's predictions seriously. 29. Warren Buffett's folksy talk misleads people into thinking that what he's accomplished is easy. It's not. 30. Sleep on every investment decision for a week, then run it by a trusted friend before acting. 31. Two things you can do to make yourself a better investor are increase the amount of time you're investing for and the humility you put into your ideas. 32. Just as you should dress appropriately for your age, you should spend appropriately for your income, and not a penny more.  33. Warren Buffett has the best explanation of dumb risk-taking: \"To make money they didn't have and didn't need, they risked what they did have and did need. And that's foolish. It is just plain foolish.\" 34. You can probably afford not to be a great investor -- you probably can't afford to be a bad one. 35. You're twice as gullible as you think you are. 36. Learn more from your bad investments than your good ones.  37. Judge investors by the quality of their arguments, not the performance of their last trade. 38. You can realistically afford probably half the home the mortgage broker approves you for. 39. Teach your kids about money before they're old enough to earn their own.  40. Admit when you are wrong.  41. Imagine how much stuff you'd have to make up if you were forced to talk 24/7. Remember this when watching financial news on TV. 42. There is, and always will be, more money to be made providing investment advice than receiving it. 43. Assume the worst, hope for the best, accept reality.  44. Save for your own retirement; assume Social Security and private pensions won't be around (even though they probably will). 45. Annuities: A product mixing the complexity of high finance with the sales tactics of used-car salesman has an entirely predictable outcome. 46. The correlation between confidence and future regret is incredibly high. 47. During the last 100 years, there have been more 10 percent market pullbacks than Christmases. Everyone knows Christmas will come; think of volatility the same way. 48. Don't attempt to keep up with the Joneses without realizing the Joneses aren't any happier than you are. 49. Predictions, opinions, and forecasts should be discounted by the number of times the person making them is on TV each week. 50. Not taking advantage of an employer match on your 401(k) is no different from declining a raise. 51. Don't let Washington sway your investment decisions. Congress has been a dysfunctional swamp of disappointment since 1789, and stocks have done well ever since. 52. To quote Larry Summers: \"A good rule of thumb for many things in life holds that things take longer to happen than you think they will, and then happen faster than you thought they could.\" 53. Another Larry Summers gem: \"THERE ARE IDIOTS. Look around.\" 54. \"Invest in what you know\" is dangerously simplified.  55. Quit day trading, and donate your money to charity instead. Same financial result for you, and a better outcome for society. 56. Most people's biggest expense is interest, which comes from living beyond your means, and buying things they think will impress others, which comes from insecurity. Avoid these two and you'll grow richer than most of your peers. 57. Reaching for yield to increase your income is often like sticking your hands in a fire to warm them up -- good in theory, disastrous in practice.  58. Your devotion to a political party or economic philosophy is directly proportional to your tendency to think irrationally about how politics affects your investments. 59. Most people need a financial adviser, but everyone needs a financial counselor, or someone to talk them off the ledge before making a dumb decision. 60. There's a strong negative correlation between flaunting money and being rich.  61. Investors were probably better informed 20 years ago when there was 90 percent less financial news. "

      "text": "Every April, taxpayers procrastinate and wait until the last minute to file their tax returns. According to the IRS about 28 percent of taxpayers wait until these last weeks to prepare their taxes. If you're among those that procrastinated this year, here are six reasons to file your taxes before the April 15th tax deadline.  Faster refunds. One of the most common reasons to e-file your taxes before the tax deadline is to receive your tax refund as soon as possible. Last tax season about 75 percent of taxpayers received a tax refund close to $3,000. Filing your return electronically with direct deposit into your bank account is the fastest way to get your precious tax refund! It can take up to several weeks longer for paper returns, but according to the IRS, 9 out of 10 taxpayers that e-file with direct deposit receive their tax refunds in 21 days or less. It's easy. You can easily and accurately file your federal taxes online in the comfort of your own home, and for the millions of taxpayers with simple tax returns you may be able to file for free, saving you hundreds of dollars versus going to a tax store. The IRS recently reported that taxpayers who file their own returns from their home computers have increased approximately 6 percent compared to last tax season. There's no reason you can't be one of the millions that accurately files your own taxes, without ever leaving the house, while also saving money on tax preparation fees. You can even e-file your tax return up until 11:59 on April 15th and make the tax deadline. Extension to file isn't an extension to pay. An extension will give you extra time to file your return, but any amount you owe is still due by April 15th. An extension can help reduce penalties, but any outstanding balance will normally be charged a failure-to-pay penalty (0.5 percent per month) and garner interest (right now at three percent annually). And let's be honest, nobody wants to pay Uncle Sam a penny more than necessary. E-filing your tax return by the tax deadline helps you avoid this situation. Extra time to pay balance due. If you owe a balance due to the IRS, you may still have a good reason to file your return as soon as you can. For example, if you submit your return now, you would not have to pay your balance due until the tax filing deadline on April 15th. Preparing your taxes before the deadline will give you time to arrange your payment. This extra time is particularly helpful to taxpayers who need to find out exactly how much they will owe the IRS. The IRS also has the Fresh Start initiative, where you can e-file your taxes by the tax deadline and get an installment agreement with the IRS to make payments on the taxes you owe for up to 72 months. Obtaining financial information. If you are expecting a big life change, such as purchasing a house or returning to college, preparing your tax return before the tax deadline can help you obtain essential information. College students use the information from their Form 1040 to apply for financial aid, while prospective homebuyers often have to show their completed tax return as proof of their household income. Getting your tax return done before April 15th -- whether you owe money or expect a refund -- gives you a head start on the important documentation you will need for these life changes. Feel a sigh of relief. Until you prepare your return, it will just loom over your head like a dark cloud. Once you've prepared and filed your tax return, you can put a smile on your face and celebrate that your taxes are done. Do you have other questions about why you should file in time for the April 15th deadline? Be sure to visit the TurboTax blog, or leave me a comment. "

      "text": "Somewhere on the placid beaches of Los Cabos, Mexico, a financial advisor lounges on a deck chair, watching waves crash on the shore. He's sipping a margarita, chatting with friends, maybe watching a video on the new iPad he just won. He's enjoying a vacation after a hectic week at the office. And the best part: it's all free. Who paid for this guy's luxury vacation? Well, if you bought an annuity recently, you might have funded that advisor's week on the beach. Recently, two marketing e-mails from insurance companies landed in my inbox, offering incentives to persuade me to sell annuities to my clients. One of these e-mails promised a vacation to Los Cabos for brokers who sold $750,000 worth of fixed annuities, in addition to a 2.5 percent commission rate.   Another e-mail from a different company promised a 7 percent commission and a free iPad for selling that company's annuities. (The offenders shall remain nameless here.) Those e-mails represent a lot of the spam that clogs my inbox every week, since plenty of insurance companies offer goodies for peddling annuities and other financial products.   \"So what's the problem?\" you might ask. Other industries motivate sales reps with bonuses, since employees work harder when they reap rewards in proportion to their efforts. After all, self-interest drives everybody's behavior to some extent. The problem, however, arises when a financial advisor's self-interest conflicts with yours. If you've ever browsed through a used car lot, then you've seen the dangers of a payment scheme based on commissions. Do you believe that car salespeople have your best interests at heart? Do they offer trustworthy, objective advice? When you apply that compensation model to financial services, conflicts of interest become toxic: making bad investments, especially late in life, jeopardizes your retirement goals. Annuities in particular raise problems. I won't make a blanket statement and say they all suck, but I will say most annuities benefit insurance companies more than consumers. If you absolutely must buy an annuity, though, walk into the situation with your eyes open. To avoid a financial blunder, ask the insurance agent or broker some blunt questions. Here are four to begin with: 1. How does buying an annuity benefit me, as opposed to investing my money elsewhere? IRAs and 401Ks provide ways to invest your savings in tax-deferred accounts, without the high commissions and administrative fees charged by annuities. How do annuities stack up against these tried-and-true methods? Annuity sellers claim that annuities take risk out of investing by offering guaranteed rates of return. True enough, but the commissions and fees devour much of your profit. That leads us to the next question. 2. What kind of returns will I make? Make sure you know whether the rate is fixed or variable. In the example above, the annuity provided an annual rate of return of 3 percent. That narrowly beats inflation, but not by much --which defeats the purpose of investing to begin with. 3. How are you, the advisor, getting compensated? You should also know how much commission the advisor makes. Again, in the example cited above, the advisor makes 2.5 percent commission in relation to the 3 percent return the customer makes. When you factor in administrative and management fees, you see that the insurance company earns nearly as much as the customer -- from the customer's money. 4. How long will my money be locked up? An annuity is a type of contract, and like all contracts, it penalizes you for breaking it. In that sense it resembles cell phone plans and gym memberships, but raises the financial stakes. Many annuities slap you with \"surrender charges\" for the first five, six, or seven years. In other words, you pay a penalty fee -- sometimes as high as seven percent -- for terminating the annuity early. When you consider the compound interest that the money could have accrued over the years in another investment, those losses cut deep.  By the way: if annuities yield such great benefits, why does the company charge you a surrender fee in the first place? Maybe because they expect customers to jump ship when they see the dismal rates of return. When you ask tough questions, the advisor can't defend products that don't serve your interest. It benefits you to put them in the hot seat. Doing so could save you thousands of dollars over the years. Then you can pay for your own dream vacation, not someone else's. "

      "text": "by John Ulzheimer, Credit Expert for CreditSesame.com I've often been asked exactly how much a bad credit score will cost you over your lifetime. And while that question is hard to answer definitively for every person reading this, it is a fact that poor credit will make your life more expensive across a variety of services. Higher interest rates, larger deposits, more expensive premiums and the lack of access to quality financial services are all ways a poor credit score can cost you more. But, exactly how much more? No two people have the same credit appetite so you can't simply say that poor credit will cost you $500,000 over your consumer credit life cycle. Someone who leans heavily on credit is clearly going to have a larger penalty than someone who chooses to pay cash for everything. However, if you were to compare apples to apples across similar loan products, it doesn't take long to see just how expensive bad credit can become. Mortgage Loans If you have poor FICO or VantageScore credit scores, you're not going to get as low of an interest rate on a mortgage loan as someone with great credit scores would. That's simply a fact, and it can be an expensive one. Keep in mind, too, if your scores are too low, you could be denied outright. According to Informa Research, the average interest rate on a 30-year fixed rate mortgage for a consumer with a FICO score of 760 or above is 3.8 percent. If you were to take out a $200,000 mortgage loan at 3.8 percent your monthly payment would be around $935. If, however, you had a FICO score of 650, the same mortgage loan would cost you 4.9 percent, which is still a pretty good interest rate historically speaking. At 4.9 percent, however, your monthly payment on that same $200,000 mortgage would cost you about $1,060 each month. That's a difference of $125 each month. This doesn't sound like that big of a deal until you start annualizing the figures. Each year you'll pay $1,500 more in interest and if you live in the house for five years that means $7,500 more in interest. If you live in an area where the cost of living is considerably more expensive -- Bay Area, New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Los Angeles -- then the numbers are much more impressive. Using the same score difference in the previous example, and a $500,000 mortgage you'll pay $3,670 more per year and over $18,000 more over five years. These figures assume one house and one loan, but that's not necessarily reality. Most homeowners buy several houses over their lifetimes. I'm 45 and I've already purchased six (and sold five). Point being is that your added cost of home-ownership is compounded because you'll be paying more on several, consecutive or concurrent, mortgages over your lifetime. Credit Cards The average rate on a general use credit card is somewhere around 15 percent, depending on the various sources. That is likely to be the most expensive debt you'll ever service, and 15 percent is just the average. The cost of a poor credit score relative to credit card debt is much more pronounced than any other financial service. At 15 percent, someone carrying even a modest $5,000 in credit card debt and making the minimum payment will end up paying back over $12,000 and it will take over 27 years to do so. That's the best case scenario. Someone who has poor credit is going to pay a considerably higher interest rate on their credit cards. It's not unheard of for someone to pay almost 30 percent interest on a subprime credit card. So, doing the same math on the same amount of debt in the previous example, the new numbers look like this ... (you may want to sit down): At 30 percent someone carrying $5,000 in credit card debt and making the minimum payment will end up paying back over $132,000 (that's not a typo) and will take over 30 years to do so. It doesn't end with mortgages and credit cards, although their divergence is clearly the most expensive and impressive. Auto loans, insurance premiums, and utility companies all use credit scoring as a basis for your rates, premiums and deposit requirements. There's simply no getting around it. Poor credit scores make life more expensive. This post originally appeared on CreditSesame.com.

      "text": "Pop quiz: Do you know how your income taxes are spent by the U.S. government? If you can confidently answer \"yes\" to that question, you're in the minority. A February 2014 poll by GOBankingRates asked participants to rate how strongly they agreed with the following statement: \"I know how my income tax dollars are used.\" Just 8.5 percent of poll participants responded that they \"strongly agree,\" followed by \"agree\" (12.4 percent), \"neutral\" (29.7 percent), \"disagree\" (23.7 percent) and \"strongly disagree\" (25.7 percent). Why So Few Taxpayers Know Where Their Money Goes Vincenzo Villamena, managing partner of Online Taxman, a boutique CPA firm specializing in tax preparation for U.S. expatriates, said the complexity of our tax system causes Americans to disregard where their money is going and take an apathetic approach. \"I see thousands of tax returns from countries around the world,\" Villamena said. \"The complexity and opaqueness of our tax system compared to these developed countries (Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, UK) is remarkable and leaves people disenfranchised with our country.\" Villamena added, \"I have clients living around the world and running their online businesses from wherever they want while I am stuck interpreting tax code that has not been updated since the 1950s.\" However, while the U.S. tax system is complex and sometimes confusing, education is a two-way street. Bob Wheeler, CEO of RWWCPA.com and author of The Money Nerve: Navigating the Emotions of Money, explained, \"Many people choose to be afraid of taxes and the IRS. They unconsciously choose to play a victim role in regards to their tax situations.\" In fact, Wheeler sees this type of attitude pop up in many aspects of personal finances. \"If they don't understand it, they don't have to be responsible,\" he said. \"Many people will say that they are not good with numbers or that the tax code has gotten too complicated. Most people don't like dealing with the reality of the numbers and so it's better to not get informed and have to make different choices.\" In other words, there needs to be accountability on the individual level for seeking this information out, too -- information that is readily available. How Income Taxes Are Spent: A Receipt So, if you'd like to be a more informed taxpayer, find out below how the thousands of dollars you hand over to the IRS every year are being spent. Using information released by the White House and the per capita personal income of $42,693 (according to Bureau of Business and Economic Research), GOBankingRates calculated how the average American's 2013 federal income tax bill breaks down. See the graphic here. $1,263.18 - National Defense (24.64%): At just under a quarter of your federal income tax bill, national defense is the largest spending category. It includes salaries and benefits for military personnel, equipment and supplies, research, weapons and construction. $1,202.30 - Health Care (22.45%): The next largest area of federal income tax spending is health care, which includes Medicaid and Medicare, the CHIP program, COBRA tax credit, research and disease control. $968.94 - Job and Family Security (17.26%): Services like unemployment insurance, food stamps and other nutrition assistance, as well as housing assistance, fall into this section. $400.77 - Additional Government Programs (11.38%): A catch-all for the rest of the government programs that receive federal income tax dollars, this category includes transportation and governmental administration.  $410.91 - Net Interest (8.01%): This income tax category goes to paying interest on Treasury debt securities, as well as other interest. $228.29 - Veterans Benefits (4.53%): Most of the taxes allocated to veterans benefits pay for income and housing support. This category also includes health care, education and training for veterans. $182.63 - Education and Job Training (3.30%): At just over 3 percent of the average federal income tax bill, the majority of taxes in this category pay for elementary, secondary and vocational education. Additionally, financial aid and job training services fall under this section. $101.46 - Natural Resources, Energy and Environment (2.05%): Programs such as water and land management, energy supply and conservation, and environmental protection get about 2 percent of federal income taxes. $101.46 - Immigration, Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice (2.05%): Things like border security and immigration enforcement fall into this category, as well as various activities related to administration of justice. $81.17 - International Affairs (1.72%): At less than 2 percent of the average tax bill, international affairs Includes humanitarian assistance, security assistance and foreign affairs. $50.73 - Science, Space and Technology Programs (1.06%): The bulk of these tax dollars is allocated to NASA and the Natural Science Foundation. $35.51 - Agriculture (0.65%): Less than 1 percent of federal income tax dollars are spent on research, crop insurance and agricultural subsidies. $25.37 - Community, Area and Regional Development (0.48%): Just under half a percent of your tax bill goes toward spending to strengthen communities. $20.29 - Response to Natural Disasters (0.43%): Finally, the last half percent or so is allocated toward natural disaster response and insurance, like Small Business Administration disaster loans and FEMA grants.

      "text": "Homeowners with a mortgage usually want to reduce their interest cost by paying down the loan balance as fast as possible. This article is about what borrowers can and cannot do on their own. Next week I look at various schemes that claim to make the task easier.  Is there any benefit in making scheduled payments before the due date?  No. One of the many readers who have asked me this question told me that she was in the habit of making payments 6 months early! She was crestfallen to learn that this practice did not reduce her interest cost at all.  On a standard mortgage, interest accrues monthly, and is calculated by multiplying one-twelfth of the annual interest rate times the loan balance at the end of the preceding month. For example, if the loan balance is $100,000 and the interest rate is 6 percent, the interest due is .06/12 x 100,000, or $500. The borrower owes $500 regardless of when the payment is made or how many days there are in the month,. If the payment is late by more than the 10 or 15 day \"grace period,\" there is an additional late fee. But there is no rebate for paying early.  Simple interest mortgages, on which interest accrues daily, are an exception. On these mortgages, every day of delay in making the payment increases the interest cost, and paying early does reduce the borrower's interest bill. Simple interest mortgages used to be fairly common, but I am not aware of any being offered today.  Do extra payments save more interest when made in some months?  No, the only valid rule is that the sooner you make the payment, the more interest you will save. An idea that keeps popping up in my mailbox is that the best month in which to make extra payments to principal is January. It is certainly true that a January payment saves more interest than one made in the succeeding February, but it saves less than one made the preceding December. Is there a best time within the month to make an extra payment to principal?  Yes, the best time within the month to make an extra payment is the last day on which the lender will credit you for the current month, rather than deferring credit until the following month. If it is the 15th, for example, an extra payment made within the first 15 days of January will reduce your balance that month and the interest due in February. Payments made the 16th or later will not be credited until February, and the interest deduction will be deferred until March.  There is no universal lender practice in crediting extra payments. Some lenders will credit payments received anytime during the month while others are much more restrictive. In most cases, extra payments sent in with the scheduled payment will be credited the same month, but it is a good idea to ask your lender what their rule is.  Is there a best way in which to make an extra payment?  No, you can use the same payment method that you use to make your scheduled payment. Just bear in mind that the relevant date is when the payment is credited by the lender, not the date when you sent it.  A practice you should avoid is to make the extra payment an exact multiple of your scheduled payment. If that payment is $610.43, for example, don't make a payment of $1,220.86 because then the lender will probably interpret the additional amount as an advance of your scheduled payment and hold it, rather than pay down your balance. Is there a best way to allocate extra payments when a borrower has two mortgages on the same property?  Yes, the general rule is to pay down the second mortgage first. Not only will the second have a higher rate, but second mortgages also can make life more complicated for borrowers looking to refinance or having payment difficulties.  The possible exception is a HELOC second, which might well carry a lower rate than the first mortgage, though it has high potential for future rate increases. The borrower who directs extra payments to a HELOC that has not yet reached the stage of mandatory repayment increases his credit line by the amount of the extra payment. This could be a desirable outcome for the borrower. Is there a best way to allocate extra payments when a borrower-investor has mortgages on several properties?  Yes, the general rule is that you save the most by paying down the mortgage with the highest interest rate first. One possible exception is where the mortgage that does not have the higher current rate is exposed to the most interest rate risk. For example, a borrower with a 4.5 percent fixed-rate mortgage and a 4 percent adjustable-rate mortgage, both in the early stages of their lives, might well elect to pay down the adjustable-rate mortgage because of the possibility that at some future time its rate could go as high as 9 percent.  Another possible exception would be where the lower-rate mortgage has a greater potential for a profitable refinance. For example, a 6 percent mortgage has a loan balance that is 89 percent of property value while a 5.75 percent mortgage is at 81 percent. If the extra payment directed to the lower-rate mortgage reduces the balance to 80 percent, no mortgage insurance would be required to refinance it. A third possible exception is where the borrower-investor has so many lenders have a limit of 10. In that situation, the borrower looking toward further expansion wants a complete payoff ASAP and will concentrate all extra payments to the mortgage with the smallest balance. "

      "text": "By Paula Pant It's that time of year again! Temperatures are getting warmer (or trying to), days are longer, and you're starting to feel that urge to open up the windows and clean out the dust bunnies for a fresh new start. But while you're vacuuming and sweeping and polishing, don't forget another big area of your life that could also do with an annual overhaul: your finances. \"Spring cleaning\" your finances means first taking a big-picture look at your financial health, and then clearing out the cobwebs that muck up your monthly budget. Here's your game plan: Assess Your Current Situation Don't just look at the next bill you have due -- look at the big picture. What's your net worth (all your assets, minus your liabilities)? How quickly are you paying off debt? How fast are your savings growing? What are your big goals (such as buying a house), and how quickly are you progressing? It's hard to stay on the right track if you're not sure where you're going, so get clear on your situation first and foremost. Clear Out the Clutter Clean any expenses that are unnecessarily dragging you down, such as: \u2022 Subscriptions to magazines or other services you rarely use. \u2022 Pricey cable subscriptions. Do you really need that 300-channel package when you watch maybe 10 channels regularly? \u2022 Monthly gym memberships when you know you're never really going to go to the gym, as much as you say you will. \u2022 Late fees, convenience fees and other charges you could eliminate if you just planned a little more in advance. Automate your bills to avoid late payments. Plan out your meals in advance so you don't find yourself grabbing fast food on the go. An ounce of prevention, as they say... Review Your Ongoing Payments When you have regular recurring expenses, it's easy to \"set it and forget it\" -- you analyze the costs when you first sign up, then keep paying the same amount every month out of sheer habit. Take a look at your ongoing payments to make sure you're still getting a solid deal. This includes: \u2022 Your cell phone plan. Do you really use all those minutes? Can you cut back on your data plan? \u2022 Car insurance. Can you take a safe driving course to get a discount? \u2022 Homeowner's/renter's insurance. Do you have all the coverage you really need? \u2022 Multiple-policy discounts. Can you bundle any of your services to save even more? Review Your Portfolio Check in to make sure you're allocating assets the way you should be. Your mix of stocks and bonds should be aligned with your age, timeline, goals and risk tolerance. (And within those broad umbrellas, your mix of large-cap vs. small-cap stocks, U.S. vs. international stocks, Treasury bonds vs. junk bonds, etc., should be properly allocated, as well.)  Are you investing in a decent mix that's aligned with your age? Have your priorities changed so that some adjustments need to be made? Rebalance if needed. Maximize Your Savings Automate your savings so that a certain amount is deducted from your checking account or paycheck every period. Send that money into a savings account. Make sure your savings are in an account that pays a decent interest rate.  \"Out of sight, out of mind,\" is the easiest way to keep yourself from dipping into the money to meant to put aside. Check Your Credit Score! This is an important step that so many people neglect. Credit makes a huge impact on everything from your insurance rates to your ability to rent an apartment or refinance a mortgage.  If you're not monitoring your credit, you're putting yourself at unnecessary risk. And you might be paying higher interest rates, higher insurance premiums, or other fees as a result of \"bad credit\" that's the result of a simple, solvable error. You're entitled to a free credit check from each of the major credit reporting agencies (Experian, Equifax and Transunion) once a year. Take advantage of that benefit. The best way to monitor your credit is to check once every four months (e.g. January, May and September) with one of the three credit agencies, in rotation. If you spot an errors, report it to the agency immediately. "

      "text": "Delayed gratification is difficult, whether you are 2 or 62 years old. When it comes to Social Security, most people don't delay their gratification. In fact, according to ING U.S.'s 2013 Retirement Experience study, 65 percent of retirees start taking Social Security benefits at age 62.  Opting for an early start greatly reduces the benefit amount over the course of one's life, effectively locking in a lower income stream. When planning for retirement, it is important to think carefully about the best age to start collecting Social Security. How does starting at age 62, 66 or 70 impact your retirement income? As you figure out when to start Social Security, here are five key questions to consider. #1: How much have I saved for retirement?  It is well documented that most Americans are not saving enough for retirement. For example, the ING U.S. 2012 Retirement Revealed study found that the average worker has saved only $130,000 for retirement. Most people are not in a financial position to retire at age 62.  To understand where you stand, determine what your savings will translate into in terms of monthly retirement income. ING U.S. offers an Income Needs online calculator that can help with this. This planning, along with figuring out your Social Security benefit amount, provides you with a clearer sense of your monthly income in retirement and when you can realistically retire. #2: Am I planning to work past age 62? Most Americans now work past age 62. Working into one's late 60s or even 70s is becoming the new normal and correspondingly, many will wait to start taking their Social Security benefit. The ING U.S. Retirement Experience study found that three-quarters of pre-retirees plan to wait until age 65 or older to start taking Social Security. Waiting a few extra years can help with retirement readiness and provide a much-needed income cushion in retirement.  There is yet another reason to delay drawing on your Social Security benefit past age 62. Social Security benefits are reduced if you earn more than $15,480 annually until the year you reach your full retirement age, which is between 66 and 67 years old, depending on your birth year. After full retirement age, any income earned does not impact your Social Security benefit. Younger retirees can end up shooting themselves in the foot as they collect Social Security and are forced to ask employers to cut back hours so they do not lose benefits. #3: How much will my Social Security benefit be? Before making any Social Security decisions, figure out how much your benefit will be. The amount will depend on how long you've worked, income amount earned and expected retirement age. Your Social Security account statement provides your specific benefit amount and can be accessed through the SocialSecurity.gov website.  To help make sense of your benefit amount and run through different scenarios, visit a local Social Security office and speak to an administrator in person. Working with a financial advisor can also help provide clarity as to the best time to tap your Social Security benefits and determine how much your benefit will be.  #4: What spousal benefits do I need to consider? How and when to take spousal benefits also trips up many retirees. Anyone who has been married for at least one year or longer has the ability to access spousal benefits after they reach age 62. This is particularly helpful for situations where a spouse is a full-time homemaker or there is a big income difference between the spouses. In divorce situations, someone must have been married for at least 10 years or longer and not currently married to access an ex-spouse's benefits. There are some key nuances to spousal benefits to be aware of as well. First, a spouse can collect either a spousal benefit or their own if they have worked long enough (40 quarters), but not both benefits simultaneously. Next, the spousal benefit is 50 percent of the working spouse's benefit. And finally, a surviving spouse can start collecting a widow benefit after age 60. But, if this individual gets re-married, they can no longer access their deceased spouse's benefit. Couples may want to consider creating a joint plan for when each should start Social Security benefits, factoring in incomes, ages and spousal benefits to help maximize retirement income. #5: What if I delay taking benefits past my full retirement age?  There is actually a financial incentive to delay. Starting at your full retirement age up until age 70, your Social Security base amount compounds, growing 8 percent annually. Of course, with this strategy, you would need other sources of income to support yourself during those years, whether it is employment, a spouse's benefit or retirement savings.  The maze of Social Security decisions can be overwhelming. Consulting with a financial advisor can help make sense of this maze in order to develop a financial plan for retirement. A financial advisor can talk through these five questions to provide clarity about Social Security benefit options and determine how they fit into an overall financial plan to ultimately help drive retirement readiness.

      "text": "For some time the esoteric argument of debt relief companies putting debt outside the statute of limitations in a credit counseling or debt settlement program, has been bantered about. But a recent twist to this otherwise academic discussion has put a new emphasis on this issue. A Seventh Circuit court opinion found that debt collectors' letters to consumers offering to \"settle\" time-barred debts (that is, debts that would be subject to a successful statute-of-limitations defense) could mislead consumers and, thus, could violate the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). From the written opinion: \"The proposition that a debt collector violates the FDCPA when it misleads an unsophisticated consumer to believe a time\u2010barred debt is legally enforceable, regardless of whether litigation is threatened, is straightforward under the statute. Section 1692e(2)(A) specifically prohibits the false representation of the character or legal status of any debt. Whether a debt is legally enforceable is a central fact about the character and legal status of that debt. A misrepresentation about that fact thus violates the FDCPA.  Matters may be even worse if the debt collector adds a threat of litigation, see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 1692e(5), but such a threat is not a necessary element of a claim. We recognize that this interpretation conflicts with that of the Eighth and Third Circuits. See Huertas v. Galaxy Asset Mgmt., 641 F.3d 28, 33 (3d Cir. 2011); Freyermuth v. Credit Bureau Servs., Inc., 248 F.3d 767, 771 (8th Cir. 2001).  With respect, however, we have concluded that the statute cannot bear the reading that those courts have given it. [footnote omitted] In their view, if a dunning letter on a time\u2010barred debt states that the collector could sue but promised not to, that letter would not violate the FDCPA, since no litigation was actually threatened (and indeed was expressly rejected). On its face, that may seem reasonable, but closer examination reveals why it is not.  The plain language of the FDCPA prohibits not only threatening to take actions that the collector cannot take, but also the use of any false, deceptive, or misleading representation, including those about the character or legal status of any debt. If a debt collector stated that it could sue on a timebarred debt but was promising to forbear, that statement would be a false representation about the legal status of that debt.\"  \"Our decision today does not require debt collectors to conduct additional research. If a debt collector does not know whether the debt submitted for collection is time barred, it would be easy to include general language about that possibility. That said, we find it unlikely that debt owners lack knowledge about the age of the debts they are attempting to collect.  If the debt collector is the original creditor, it will know the relevant dates. If the collector is a third party collecting on behalf of the original creditor, it should easily be able to get that information at the time the file is assigned by the original creditor on whose behalf it is acting. If the collector has purchased the debt from the original creditor, we know from the [Federal Trade Commission] that such buyers pay different amounts for debts depending on the age of the debt and the number of previous attempts to collect it, in which case whether the debt is time\u2010barred should be known.\" - Source This issue about out of SOL debt and debt relief companies is important for consumers to be aware of and informed about so they do not rush to settle or repay debt that is out of the Statute of Limitations (SOL) or time barred.  And the statute of limitations isn't so clear cut that anyone on the street can provide correct advice. It would be best to get the opinion of an attorney who is licensed in the state the consumer lives in to make sure which state statute applies in a specific and particular situation. Consumers need appropriate disclosures and awareness before enrolling debt in a debt relief program so they can make an informed decision about how they really want to tackle the out of SOL debt. And this should be equally important for the debt relief company to be aware of as well. Out of SOL debt should be the lowest priority on repayment and set aside till all other debts are tackled first. The biggest problem for credit counseling and debt settlement companies seems to be in blindly assisting the consumer to repay debt which would otherwise not be legally repayable. Or worse yet if the debt relief company represented to the consumer they debt was still legally repayable when it was not. That's where it seems a debt relief company could brush up against the same FDCPA problem the debt collector did.

      "text": "Your credit score and credit report go hand in hand, but they are actually two different entities that can impact your finances. Your actual credit score determines your overall worthiness as a borrower, while your report is a full summary of how you've handled credit within recent years. Knowing the difference between a credit score and credit report can help you make the right financial decision when it comes to applying for lines of credit, and can also help you get better interest rates on loans. Someone who wants a quick glance at your current standing can take a look at your score to determine your eligibility for a loan, what interest rate to charge, and how much of a risk you appear to be. Yet, it is still important to have a solid report, because it is a comprehensive breakdown of your personal credit history and your borrowing habits. Credit scores play a vital role Think of a credit score as a lender's way to get a glimpse into how you manage to pay your debt down and whether you do so on time. Credit scores range from 300 to 800, with a higher score having more value. Whenever you get pre-approved for things like credit cards or a home purchase, your credit score is going to determine how a lender treats you. So do your best to get your score as high as possible to give a good first impression to lenders.  Having a solid credit report is important You need a solid credit report for at least a few years in order to apply for more complicated loans such as a mortgage. When you apply, your credit report will be pulled up and analyzed in detail. Lenders look at your payment history, how much of your overall credit you are using, the amount of loans you have taken out, how many lines of credit you have applied for recently, and a few other factors on your report to determine how worthy you are to receive a home loan. You could have a weaker credit score, but if you have made a serious commitment to pay off your debts, that effort can help give you leverage when applying for a loan. Before a lender hastily rejects you, or offers you a line of credit with high interest, you can show them your credit report. Inform the lender of your recent effort to pay down your debt -- you may not be aware of it, but you have negotiating power when it comes to taking out a loan, especially if your have recently improved your credit score and report. Overall, Americans maintain a below average credit score. The average VantageScore credit score is 736, according to Experian. A credit score of 736 may appear high, but for VantageScore standards that is below mediocre. When it comes to VantageScore, a score of around 790 is considered as average. It's important for you to be aware of your credit score and history, and that way you know where you stand in relation to your score. Remember to check your credit report each quarter to ensure there are no errors or fraud. Gerald Morales is a writer for MyBankTracker.com "

      "text": "You need to have credit to get credit. It's the classic catch-22 of personal finance.  And it makes sense. Your credit score is, after all, built on your credit history. No credit history means no credit score. And no credit score makes lenders hesitant to give you even small amounts of credit. So how does anyone get credit in the first place? There are slow-and-steady ways to begin building credit. Opening a bank account, paying bills in your own name, and using a secured credit card are sound approaches to building a solid financial foundation. But one of the easiest ways to build credit is to become an authorized user on someone else's credit card account. It's known as \"piggybacking.\" You're riding on another person's creditworthy coattails. Becoming an authorized user is simple, and it's one of the faster ways to build a history of good credit. Before becoming an authorized user, however, first understand exactly how this helps build your credit. Then, be sure you understand the risks involved. What is an Authorized User? An authorized user is one who can use another person's credit card. It's common for parents to add a child to their credit card account as an authorized user. Then, the child can use the parents' credit card as needed. An authorized user can charge the credit card, and has most of the same card-related privileges as the credit card owner. Authorized users generally are not, however, liable for the debt. Importantly, there is no credit check required to become an authorized user. As a result, one can become an authorized user even if they have bad credit or no credit at all. How to Become One You can't add yourself as an authorized user to someone else's credit card. But if a family member or friend agrees to add you, it's easy to do. Most credit card issuers let the cardholder add an authorized user in a matter of seconds online. The Good By becoming an authorized user on someone else's credit card account, the account is reported on your credit file. The payments made on the account each month are reflected on the authorized user's credit, as are the credit limits, type of account and utilization. That's what makes this the easiest way to build credit. You don't have to spend a dime to build a credit history. And authorized users are not obligated to pay on the credit card, even if the cardholder racks up a ton of debt that he or she doesn't pay. The Bad Being an authorized user is a two-edged sword. While it can help you build a good credit history, it can also have negative effects. If the card holder makes payments late or charges the credit card to limit, these negative credit items will appear on your credit history. And, unfortunately, as an authorized user, you have no control over what happens with the credit card account. You can, however, remove yourself as an authorized user should this happen. The Ugly There is a dark side to authorized users. It's often called piggybacking or credit boosting. It occurs when individuals are added as authorized users for the sole purpose of increasing their credit scores. It often involves an individual with bad credit paying a fee to be added to another person's (often a complete stranger) tradeline. Credit bureaus are well aware of this practice and have implemented ways to detect it. While the FICO scoring model continues to consider legitimate authorized user accounts (e.g., when a parent adds a college-bound child to a credit card), they have taken steps to detect and exclude accounts flagged as authorized user abuse. Being an authorized user can be a first step to building credit. It's important to be sure the credit card holder is handling his or her credit responsibly. And avoid any schemes involving a fee to be added to a stranger's account. "

      "text": "Have you ever wondered what happens to your money when you die? Investors over the years have told me that they have it all worked out. \"I've got a will, a trust and spoke to an attorney.\" Often, those instructions were done years ago, sometimes decades ago. So when you die, where's your dough go? It can be a difficult process. It all has to do with the instructions, or lack of, that you left before you passed away. What actually happens is determined by you and your state and local inheritance laws. I know, I really didn't answer the question, but let's go a little further because there are so many variables. Here are some of the gold diggers, uh people, that will probably get a piece of your estate: Your Spouse If you are married, most of your money will pass to your honey when you die. It will allow you to avoid probate on jointly owned assets. If you have assets just in your name, these funds will pass through the probate process if they don't have a beneficiary designation. I have discussed this in previous articles. Make sure you have a beneficiary named, even on things that don't require one. Your Other Beneficiaries The other people named in your will, trusts or listed as beneficiaries will receive whatever portion you designate once you die. By listing who gets what, it will be easier on your brother, sister or kids as executors to distribute the assets. That way you don't have two family members arguing over that antique table that each one swears you left them! I've said this before, any named beneficiary supersedes the beneficiary listed in the will. A great example is a life insurance policy. You list your spouse as the beneficiary on the life insurance application, then in your will donate these proceeds to a charity. Uh oh! The spouse gets the funds not your charity. Make sure you have a good financial planner and estate attorney to review your beneficiaries at least once per year.  Your Creditors If you die and owe money, then your estate and its executor is responsible for paying those debts. In some cases, the debt exceeds the estate assets. With that much debt, sometimes the courts and a judge have to step in to decide which creditors get what assets. Sort of an estate referee. Creditors have a certain amount of time to file claim to what they are owed. That's part of the probate process too. Your Government Now if you have a large estate, then you might have to pay estate and inheritance taxes. Beneficiaries will only receive their inheritance after the taxes are paid. Yep, your old Uncle Sam has his hand out even when you are dead! In the recent sad death of Phillip Seymour Hoffman, if he had married his long-time partner, the $35 million estate could have passed tax free to her. Just by getting married, he could have protected 40 percent of the estate. If you're not sure if your estate and beneficiaries are up to date, seek out a knowledgeable estate planning attorney. Use the tools available so that the money you worked hard for goes to your loved ones or your favorite charity.  If you like my article, learn more here!

      "text": "Henry Ford said,  \"It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.\" Ford was right, and that revolution has begun. It has taken the form of Bitcoin and Bitcoin spinoff currencies, such as the soon-to-launch \"ProducerCoin\" shown here, that are quickly spreading throughout the world.   Since Bitcoin surfaced in 2009, speculation has run rampant regarding the identity of the individual or group responsible for it's development. The question is certainly intriguing, but unless the inventors had something sinister in mind, the origin of Bitcoin is of little importance, because the coin's decentralized peer-to-peer protocol acts as a protective firewall for each user.  Critics of Central Bank monopolies, this reporter included, hope these so-called crypto-currencies will offer a new form of \"percolate up\" economics to a struggling world dominated by powerful banks. Recent trends may be a good measure of that probability. When the Mt. Gox Bitcoin exchange went bust, detractors declared Bitcoin dead, but they were wrong, for even in the face of these big losses, the total market cap of all crypto-currencies continued to grow. The number of new Bitcoin-based currencies has doubled in recent months, now totaling 190, with several more launching each week. A full list of all of these new crypto-currencies is available at coinmarketcap.com. Although many of these coins resemble pump-and-dump penny stocks with names as foolish as their mission statements, others are founded on sound economic principles with altruistic goals. What the soothsayers of Bitcoin's doom don't understand is that teams of people are hard at work to perfect software programs that ride on top of the original Bitcoin protocol, similar to the way HTTP rides on top of TCP-IP, and these companies will soon have a clickable GUI, similar to the graphical user interface of Windows which will allow folks like you and me to easily launch new currencies specifically for niche applications.  This new piggyback system will effectively elevate crypto-currencies from the \"rabbit hole\" of programmer's language to an intuitive, easy to navigate environment. When this happens, the original Bitcoin will probably change from a speculative crypto-currency to a permanent TCP-IP platform. Subsequently, Bitcoin should develop an intrinsic value that can't be destroyed by speculation. The companies involved in this GUI land rush around Bitcoin include Counterparty, Mastercoin, Humint, Ethereum and NXT, just to name a few. At this writing, it appears that Counterparty is leading the race, with the others not far behind. Most of these companies will use the Bitcoin protocol for their launch pad and a few are trying to improve upon the basic Bitcoin concept. Currently, KCAA Radio airs five programs each week about Bitcoin. The source of this programming is a fast growing Internet-based Radio Network called \"Let's Talk Bitcoin.\"  As a result of this association, KCAA Radio became the first terrestrial radio station in North America to accept Bitcoin as payment for airtime.  This is where the story takes a totally unexpected turn. It can be summed up by the late Paul Harvey's signature quote, \"And now, the rest of the story.\" As a long time critic of \"The Fed\" and co-author of a book on alternative monetary policy, The Nature Of Wealth, published in 1994, I have consistently advocated for the direct injection of United States notes into the economy. I believe this will spur economic growth without increasing debt, because U.S. notes can be printed and spent into circulation in order to fund the important work of government without borrowing the funds into existence from a central bank, which creates an endless cycle of capital debt expansion. Since any new issuance of United States notes is politically impossible while the Federal Reserve exists, the next best \"people's currency\" seemed to be Bitcoin, at least at first glance. However, Bitcoin is deflationary, because only a limited number can be mined. This can pose big problems when Bitcoin's value outgrows it's functionality. It could eventually become the Berkshire Hathaway of crypto-currency. Enter the idea of launching ProducerCoin and EmploymentCoin, two crypto-currencies based upon the aforementioned book that can begin to improve the lives of small farmers and workers who currently earn disastrously low wages. Here is the \"EmploymentCoin.\"   When these coins are launched, consumers can buy them on coin exchanges like Coinbase and use them to purchase non-GMO organic production from local farmers at parity prices and in turn, those farmers will be required to pay a living wage for the labor force they use to produce this top-quality food. The first rule of parity pricing is as follows; The value of an hour of labor at minimum wage must be equal to the parity price of a bushel of wheat at the first point of sale. In the year 2014, these two numbers are $18.00. (See page 32 of this USDA publication.) This parity value is perfectly logical, because when a nation fails to price it's farm production and labor force at parity, public funds must be used to subsidize the farmers and millions of people on the low end of the labor force. This creates unnecessary debt and economic hardship. ProducerCoins and EmploymentCoins can begin to reverse this trend. These two additions to the Bitcoin \"Universe\" are given value when they are bought with USD by consumers. This instant monetization reduces the risk of excessive speculation, especially since the coins will be used to purchase food and labor which have an intrinsic value.  This is the type of niche that a crypto-currency can fill, and the application of such currencies is only limited by our imaginations. "

      "text": "If you are feeling a bit jaded about the promises of technology to transform your personal finances, you are not alone. Since Al Gore invented the Internet years ago there have been seemingly endless broken promises. Promises about how new technology would magically make all of your money problems disappear. Hmmm, uh not so much. That is, until just recently. Now it seems, our time is here. Rapid and innovative technological advances are completely changing the world of personal finance. A look back Before we get into these changes in personal finance technology, let's take a moment and see how far we have actually come. If you will, follow along and step into our Wayback Machine for just a moment. Take a short trip backwards in time, to say like the late 1970s into the early 1980s. If you can remember or even if you can't, there was a time when Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) were new and innovative. Can't you just see Grandma walking up to an ATM and staring at it with a puzzled and frustrated scowl on her face?  OMG, how far we have come. Yet, as you probably know, (to borrow from a popular lyric), it's been a long and winding road. After ATMs, we were promised all sorts of exciting possibilities like virtual bank accounts, remote banking and more. However as you have seen, early promises were fast and furious, but the delivery has been a bit delayed. Yet thankfully, early promises of merging technology and personal finance is finally starting to show up and to show up in a big way. To make sense of these changes, let's begin with a good working definition of personal finance, just to make sure we are all on the same page. A working definition Personal finance is all about \"the financial management needed by an individual or family to obtain, budget, save and spend financial resources over time.\" Wow, that sounds pretty dry and old school does it not? How about a new definition for a new time? What if we define personal finance as the ability to manage your money or other financial resources when you want, how you want and where you want? Our new definition is exactly what the new personal finance technology is all about. What's here right now? Start with something as basic as your checking account. As illustrated above, there was a time when you had to actually go to the bank; meaning like get in your car and drive to the bank branch to make a deposit. Wait, it gets worse. Then you had to shuffle inside and stand in line to hand over your money to a possibly surly or at least disinterested bank teller.  Nowadays? Snap front, click, snap back, click, deposit. That's it. Although not yet offered by all banks, mobile banking is increasingly seen by consumers as an expected service. Of course these mobile apps offer much more than easy deposits. You can check your balance and monitor transactions at any time and any place. Not to mention the option for mobile payments and auto bill pay. If your bank doesn't yet offer mobile banking you might want to ask, why not?  Banking is only one way technology is available now for your personal finance needs. Say goodbye and good riddance to the shoebox at the bottom of your closet. A growing number of online solutions to store your receipts are more useful and more convenient. Yes, you may be familiar with such solutions as Neat Receipts. But even Neat Receipts is starting to a little faded around the edges when you take a look at what's out there. For example check out solutions such as planetreceipt.com, onereceipt.com, lemonwallet (now owned by Lifelock) and many more. To the land of way beyond? Beyond banking and beyond receipts, there is also a growing trend towards alternative payment solutions. First there was PayPal which lets you transfer money around the world. Yet now there are even more exciting technologies. Yes, these new technologies are still in the proving stages, but keep in mind the way technology advances show up in the real world. Do you remember the early days of Paypal? It seemed so strange at the time. \"You mean I can just send money to anybody around the world?\" became the chatter online. Yet, from those early beginnings led to PayPal in 2012 processed $145 billion in transactions. Yet even that may seem like chump change shortly with the advent of digital currencies. These currencies, like Bitcoin and others as seen here at http://tinyurl.com/nhygqoh may completely change our personal finance world. Here is the bottom line: early growing pains aside, the promise of a true alternative payment system has many people excited. The most obvious benefit is of course the cost savings. By cutting out the middle man, you can end up saving a bundle on fees and surcharges the big banks like to tack on to money transfers. Additionally, these new payment technologies offer even greater convenience for consumers. So what does all of this mean? In short, it means we are already there. The promised land of technology transforming personal finances is here now. And get this, from here on out, expect to see ever more innovations and solutions. Think of it as sort of a Moore's Law for personal finance. The pace of innovations in personal finance technology is accelerating each year. "

The sales pitch goes something like this: \"Normally this dress is $250 but we're having a spring special so you can get it for $199. You save over $50!\" Seems pretty innocent, doesn't it? Well here's the problem with that: We see one sign after another telling us that something is on sale and enticing us to buy. With so many specials and sales and deals, it is extremely tempting to buy things. \"After all,\" we think to ourselves, \"we need to buy them anyway so why not spend less?\" If you pay cash or debit then that is a great decision, because paying cash keeps you in budget and ensures that you don't max out your credit cards. And if you pay with credit cards and pay those cards off right away, as soon as you get the bill in April, then you still saved lots of money. Guess what: As soon as you start paying interest on your credit cards, you almost immediately erase any savings you earned in the store! If you haven't paid off your credit cards after a couple of months, you'll have spent considerably more on the product than you would have been willing to pay for the product in the store. Just imagine if the salesperson told you what was really going to happen: \"Normally this dress is $250 but we're having a spring special so you can get it for $350.\" Would you buy the dress? Of course not! No one would intentionally do that. And yet, that's what millions of people do every year during the year -- they willingly spend more than the ticket price by buying something at regular or discounted prices and then failing to pay off their credit card on time and in full. There's nothing wrong with shopping and looking for a great sale. However, when those purchased items come with an invisible, higher price tag, that's when you need to rethink your budget to help maintain good credit. "

      "text": "By AJ Smith, Credit.com We've all heard about the importance of your credit scores when it comes to buying a home. But credit is important for renting as well. Some landlords won't rent to people with low credit scores. This doesn't mean you can't rent a home or apartment, though. There are some ways to get around this and prove to a potential landlord that you can afford the home and will make payments on time. 1. Find a Co-Signer You may have bad credit, but if you have a friend or family with good credit, ask them to help you out. (But know they would be doing you a huge favor; adding someone's name to your lease is a big benefit for you and carries significant risk for them.) A co-signer is someone who signs the lease with you, taking on the legal responsibility to ensure the rent gets paid. A co-signer with good credit should ease your potential landlord's concerns.  2. Offer a Larger Deposit If you want to show your landlord that you won't skip out on payments, you can offer a higher deposit. Often landlords require first and last month's rent when you move in. If you can save up more and give them a few month's rent upfront, they may overlook your poor credit scores. Be careful, though, because while this offers the landlord more security, it offers you less. 3. Have a Personal Referral If your credit is bad but you have a good rental history, ask a former landlord to vouch for you. Hearing from a previous landlord that you have paid your rent on time in the past can carry a lot of weight with a potential landlord. He or she may be willing to overlook that low credit score and accept your application. 4. Talk About It Don't avoid the elephant in the room. Address your bad credit frankly and honestly. You can explain why your scores are low and why that doesn't accurately reflect your ability to routinely pay your rent. Landlords are aware of the difficult economy of the past few years and may appreciate your honesty. 5. Find a No-Credit-Check Rental Not all rentals require a credit check. Look for smaller landlords who don't do a credit check as part of the application process. It may require some more legwork, but it can be worth it. 6. Improve Your Credit Even if you do find a rental with bad credit, immediately begin working to improve your credit for next time. Make your payments on time. Reduce your debt. Monitor your credit reports, which you can get for free from each of the major credit bureaus once a year, and your credit scores. (You can use a free tool like Credit.com's Credit Report Card, which updates two of your credit scores every month.) Make yourself a more attractive rental candidate so you don't have to worry about it when you move. This article originally appeared on Credit.com.

      "text": "Automated teller machines can come in handy when you're in a hurry and strapped for cash. However, such a convenience will be expensive if you regularly use an ATM that isn't within your bank's ATM network because the bank and the ATM operator has the right to impose fees. But, fortunately, there are ways to avoid them. At the 10 largest U.S. banks, the average out-of-network ATM fee is $2.05. Additionally, ATM operators slap on fees of about $2 to $3. Someone who uses an out-of-network ATM five times per month is looking at a monthly expense around $20 to $25, or $240 to $300 per year. Here are some of the ways that the ATM fees can be minimized or eliminated: 1. Get debit card cash back. At certain types of stores, mainly supermarkets and gas stations, you can use your debit card to make a small purchase and ask for cash back. The cash back amount is added as part of the sale and the cashier hands you the cash. Buying something small, such as a candy bar, is cheaper than paying the ATM fee. Plus, you would have paid for a tangible good instead of a service. 2. Use your bank's mobile ATM locator tool. When you're already out and in need of cash, you may want to pull out your smartphone and use your bank's mobile application to find a nearby ATM. For all you know, it may be just around the corner. And, if you already know that you might need cash, you can go online to look up ATM locations around where you'll be going. 3. Don't forget partnered ATM networks. Many financial institutions are partnered with other institutions and ATM networks to provide expanded access to ATMs without surcharges. For instance, some credit unions are partnered with the CO-OP ATM network, which allows surcharge-free access to the ATMs of all the partnered credit unions. Many smaller banks and online banks have similar partnerships with ATM networks, such as Allpoint and STAR, to offer greater access to surcharge-free ATMs. 4. Find no-ATM-fee checking accounts. There are checking accounts that will waive or reimburse certain ATM fees. More often than not, however, they're not offered from major brick-and-mortar banks. You're more likely to find checking with no ATM fees at online banks. Ally Bank, Bank of Internet and Schwab Bank are examples of popular banks that offer free checking accounts in addition to unlimited ATM fee rebates.

      "text": "This article was written by Sarah Kaufman for Manilla.com. In between March Madness games, make these 16 changes to improve your financial life. 1. Create a budget. This doesn't mean nickel and diming yourself. Instead, use a simple formula: Your income minus your mandatory expenses (anything with a deadline -- rent, utility bills, loan payments, etc.). The difference is what you can spend on everything else. The most important reason to budget is to make sure you're not spending more than you have. Already have a budget? Reevaluate it. Look at your bank statements to find out where most of your money is going. See if you can cut back in some areas, like entertainment, to make room for putting more toward important expenses, such as retirement or debt. 2. Put more toward retirement. Make this the month you up your 401(k) contribution. Even if it's just by a percentage or two, that money will still compound interest and grow, giving you more during your post-work life. No matter how much you're saving, make sure you're contributing the maximum amount your employer will match. Don't have an employer-based retirement account? Two common options are (1) a traditional Individual Retirement Account (IRA), which allows you to contribute money now and pay taxes on them later, and (2) a Roth IRA, which forces you to pay taxes now but withdraw your funds later tax free. This could be beneficial to you if you think you'll be in a higher tax bracket when you want to withdraw. Check out a few different options here. 3. Get cash back or save with discount codes. Most things you buy online have some sort of discount code floating around the Internet. Before you make any purchase, do a simple online search for a discount code or coupon for that particular retailer. Sites like Retailmenot, Coupon.com and FatWallet all offer codes that you can apply at checkout. Or, try a cash-back site like Ebates.com or Top Cashback, all of which allow you to get cash simply for shopping online at your favorite retailers through their sites. 4. Invest in your health. Spending money on a gym membership, exercise classes or new running gear is money well spent because it could save you in healthcare costs down the road. Make this the month you start exercising. There's no need to spend hours at the gym or revamp your eating habits to see results and feel good -- instead, create small, attainable goals you know you can achieve, such as going to a gym class once a week, or eating one piece of fruit every day. 5. Reevaluate your get-out-of-debt plan. You want to make sure you're paying down your debt as quickly as possible. First, pay at least the minimum amount due and pay it on time each month. Second, readjust your budget to see if there are areas where you could cut back so that you can put more toward your debt payments. This will help you get out of debt faster and pay less in interest over time. 6. Rethink the way you use credit cards. Contrary to the way many Americans spend, credit cards should be used to build credit -- not to spend money that isn't there. If you've never used a credit card before, open one with a low annual percentage rate (APR), no annual fee, and a rewards program that offers cash back or other incentives, such as airline points or miles. Then, start small by using it to make a minor purchase each month (e.g., your cable bill). Pay it off in full each month. If you've already racked up lots of credit card debt, stop now. Cut up your cards and make the minimum payments on time each month. 7. Create new savings goals. Think five or even 10 or 15 years ahead: What will you want to buy and how much money will you need? For example, if you think you may want to buy a house one day, start saving now. Pick a goal date, pick a goal amount and then divide your goal amount by the number of years between now and the goal date (e.g., you want to buy a $300,000 house in 15 years. That's roughly a $60,000 down payment [20 percent of $300,000], so you'll need to save $4,000 a year [$60,000 divided by 15 years], or $333 a month [$4,000 a year divided by 12 months). Open a savings account based on accessibility (how often are you planning to dip into the fund?), interest (you want it to be high so your money grows), customer service, and penalties. 8. Save more on food. You can eat healthier and save more money by planning your meals each week and preparing them at home. Start by planning a weekly menu -- how many meals do you need for the week? Figure out what you want to have for each meal (e.g., eggs for breakfast, salads for lunch, etc.) and make a list. See where ingredients overlap (for example, the peppers you buy for your salad will come in handy during dinnertime) so you don't buy more than you need. Also, use rewards points. Sign up for your grocery store's rewards program so you can get money back on the items you buy. 9. Revamp your look for less. Use sites like Gilt or Hautelook to get deals on huge designers. Or, try a service like Hukkster.com, which alerts you when your favorite items go on sale. 10. Talk money with your partner Sixty-five percent of people fight about money in their relationship, according to a 2013 survey from account management service Manilla.com. The key is to communicate, communicate and communicate some more. As uncomfortable as it may be (money is awkward no matter whom you're talking to), if you're married or thinking about getting married to your partner, sit down and have a conversation about your finances. Talk about your debt, how you're planning to get out of it, your financial goals (what are you saving for?), your financial expectations (how do you want to co-manage your money?), and any other financial issues that could affect your relationship. 11. Streamline with tools. Apps, apps and more apps have been designed to make managing your money convenient and easy. Use Manilla to manage and share your bills and accounts, try Expensify to track your receipts, use Venmo to pay your friends and family, and try Spendee for budgeting. 12. Make money outside of your 9-to-5. Go through your closet and consign old clothing. Do a deep spring-cleaning, and see if you have old electronics you never use that you could sell online on eBay. Check Craigslist for babysitting or tutoring jobs. Having an extra source of income means more money saved. 13. Stop paying late fees.  We don't mean stop paying them as they come in. We mean keep them from happening! Paying late fees is like throwing money down the drain because it's completely avoidable. Set your bills on auto-pay so you don't even have to think about it, or get Manilla's bill pay reminders so that you always know when your bills are due. Making on-time payments not only helps you to stop wasting money, but it also keeps your credit right where it should be. 14. Live by the \"one in, one out\" rule. You buy something, you toss something (donate it or sell it for cash). 15. Donate to charity. It's a good thing to do, but it can also save you money. Charitable donations (cash, goods, and even money you spent on gas on your way to a charity event) are all tax deductible. Learn about more tax breaks you don't want to miss. 16. File your taxes -- now! 'Tis time. The sooner you file, the sooner you get that refund. If you owe money, filing now means more time to save up to make the payment by April 15. Gather your account documents and receipts, and get to your accountant's office or get online (try TurboTax or H&R Block at home).

      "text": "Budgeting is like exercising for many people: We know we should do it, and we really want to, but after a long day, it's pretty much the last thing on our minds. What if it could be easy? If you could tackle it without all the stress? In this article, you'll learn about the four key steps in taking control of your spending and your finances without all the agony.  photo credit: Josh Kenzer via photopin cc The Way Your Mind Works: Mental Accounts Take a second and estimate your annual income. Got it? Now quickly estimate your annual expenditures. It's a lot harder, isn't it? Most people can easily tell you their earnings but can't even come close to estimating their total spending. Now try something else: How much did you spend on gas last month? This might not have been as quick as figuring out your earnings, but it wasn't that difficult, right? It's easier to estimate a category of expenditures because we have a natural tendency to divide our spending into what behavioral economists call \"mental accounts\". In other words, we naturally split purchases into categories, such as the mortgage and the groceries, and the result is that it's much easier to estimate what we spent on each one. When it comes to tracking your spending, take advantage of your natural tendency to categorize. Think about your major expense categories for a few moments. The list probably includes things like housing, household bills, insurance, groceries, eating out, etc. How much do you spend in each one? The best advice I can give you is to take a look at this Bradford Pine Wealth Group Expense Analysis Worksheet, which I am confident will help you in the process of tracking and understanding your spending. It allows you to put in your monthly expenditures in the appropriate categories and automatically calculates your annual totals, which gives you a detailed picture of where your money is going. Gathering Data Now, some of the categories you put together might be difficult to estimate, and the amounts in others might include a bit of wishful thinking. So I also recommend that you take the time to track your actual expenses. There are as many ways to track spending as there are people. Some prefer to regularly look back through their check registry and credit card statements, others collect receipts, and some may prefer to keep a running list of their expenses on a Smartphone or piece of paper. You can also use online tools like Mint or software like Quicken, which link to your bank accounts and automatically track your expenditures for you. Many of my clients find our Expense Analysis Worksheet to be very helpful. Once you've filled it out once, it's easy to update it regularly and keep track of your spending habits over time. Whatever your strategy, I encourage you to try this out for a month, then compare the results to your estimates. While you're at it, take a look at your debt and savings habits. What are you spending money on? Are you setting money aside? Do you carry a balance on your credit cards? Your future self will thank you for asking these questions and getting your spending under control. Making a Plan Once you have all the data together, it's time to make a plan. Start with the big picture. What are your goals? What do you love to do? These might sound unrelated to budgeting, but, in the end, money is supposed to help you do the things that you want, so it's an important place to start. For example, if you're looking to start a business, you might want to think about saving more while you can to ensure a smoother ride during your start-up phase. If you're carrying credit card debt, consider how it might be holding you back from tackling that home renovation or going on that dream vacation. It's also important to communicate with your spouse. Are you both fully aware of your financial situation? Is your spouse oblivious to your debts? Having a heart to heart about what's going on and what you dream about is a critical starting point to making a new spending plan. From here, you can get down to the basics. What categories are out of whack? Are you spending more than you're earning? Should you be contributing more to your 401(k) or IRA? Have you started a 529 plan for your newborn? While it seems daunting at first, you might be surprised that there are places you can cut that are not all that painful. And by re-organizing your finances so that you can meet your big goals, whatever they may be, you might find yourself much happier overall! Adjusting for the Long Run Once you've made some decisions, it might be time to readjust to a new spending pattern. I find that putting bills and savings on automatic pilot is an amazingly useful tool when you make these kinds of changes. Not only does automation free up your mental energy for managing your discretionary spending, but it can help make it easier to achieve your goals and better manage your finances. Of course, it can be difficult to adjust to a new system, so throughout it all try to remember that the benefits of reaching your end goal, whether it's having more fun, carrying less debt, or ensuring a more secure future, are immeasurable. Taking control of your spending will not only put you at ease in the short term, but it can set you up for more fulfillment and happiness in the long run. And isn't that what life is all about? Please let me know if you find my Expense Analysis Worksheet to be helpful or if you have feedback about any enhancements you'd like to see on it! Written by Bradford Pine with Anna Wroblewska.

      "text": "Huffington Post Reader Question Dear Steve, I searched and didn't find quite what I was looking for, so I was wondering if you'd do an article on it.  My husband accrued a lot of debt to for-profit \"colleges\" before I met him. They strung him along, taking his loan money, and he was never able to graduate because they never offered him the required classes at days/times available to him as an adult learner.  So he took gen-ed after gen-ed at three different institutions, and never managed to graduate with a degree.  Student loan forgiveness programs are for GRADUATES. The Obama administration has recently spoken about steps they want to take to protect students from predatory for-profit colleges who offer no hope of graduation, but nothing about helping previous victims.  My husband is doing the best he can, but his federal student loan $$ is maxed out and he is close to $60K in debt with no degree to show for it.  He was too young and naive to know that those for -profit colleges were stringing him along at the time. He works hard at an unskilled job and is diabetic; when we last calculated, the amount of time it will take him to pay off his debt is longer than his life expectancy, so he has chosen to default - it's like throwing money into a black hole.  Would love to see your thoughts on relief for victims of for-profit colleges and your predictions for whether those people might see bankruptcy relief in the next couple of years. V Don't miss my free my weekday email newsletter with the latest tips and advice on how to beat debt and do better financially. Subscribe now. - Click Here Dear V, Thank you so much for contacting me. I think I can get you headed in the right direction, quickly. Let's knock this idea out of the way your husband was victimized by for-profit colleges. I completely agree some colleges sell classes and degree programs that are way overpriced for the field of study. I also agree that people who enroll in these programs never give any consideration to the cost of the degree, graduation rates, and what it will cost them down the line. Rather than being a victim, your husband was another cog in a dysfunctional educational system that continues to ratchet up the cost of education and trap people into massive debt. Students need to research and think about the cost of attendance before committing to student loans. Parents need to do a cost-benefit analysis of what their kids are getting into before pushing them into lifelong debt. Schools need to stop selling butts in seats to fill classrooms while passing out imaginary aid like crack. Tuition needs to stop rising faster than inflation. As you can see there are many broken parts here. You made one statement that concerned me when you said loan forgiveness is only available for graduates. That's actually not true. Federal student loan forgiveness is available for anyone with federal student loans. Graduation is absolutely not a requirement. In fact it is said that 75 percent of people with student loans never graduate or receive a degree. Your husband does not sound as if he is permanently disabled so one of the total and permanent disability forgiveness programs does not sound like a good fit. But there are other loan forgiveness programs he does sound eligible for. Let me assure you defaulting on a federal student loan is never a good strategy. Especially when some good income based repayment options exist. You should absolutely try those first and let's reserve other options to Plan B. We don't even need to consider bankruptcy or wait for bankruptcy to deal with his loans. There are things we can do right now, today. I would suggest you read this guide about all the plans and options that are available.  The most likely approach at this point would be the Income Based Repayment (IBR) program that would give him a payment as low as $0 per month and completely forgive his loans after 25 years. The IBR program requires people to re-certify each year but it is the least expensive and easiest program to enroll in right now. He sounds eligible and it would provide relief. The toughest part of his situation would be to look at his total financial situation and than use that context to fit the right program to provide the relief he needs.

      "text": "Today, you can cover your rent, mortgage payments or college education with a credit card -- but should you use plastic to pay the IRS on April 15?  There are two different reasons to pay your taxes with a credit card. First, you want to \"make money\" on your e-filing by using a card with a high cash back offer or reward points. Or second, you can't pay your taxes in full, so you'd like to spread your payments out over a longer period at zero percent interest.  These two tricks carry more risk than paying via direct deposit or a check. In fact, I would only consider these strategies if you have a strong credit rating and meticulous record of paying your credit card bills on time. Otherwise, paying with plastic will produce more problems than dividends. Here's to how navigate the choice, choose the right cards and gain an edge this tax season: Go for Points, Not Cash Back According to the IRS, there are six payment processors that can accept your credit card on behalf of Uncle Sam, and their fees range from 1.87 percent to 2.35 percent. Naturally, you would choose a 1.87 percent option, but will it pay off? Let's say you owe the IRS $10,000. For general purchases, the highest cash back rate you can get is two percent from the Fidelity Investments Rewards American Express card. If you swipe $10,000 on the card, accrue the $187 in processing fee and get $200 back, you're up $13.  In my opinion, you're much better off using a rewards card with a bonus spending incentive. For instance, the Chase Sapphire Preferred Card offers 40,000 bonus points if you spend $3,000 within the first three months of opening the card.  So, $10,000 in taxes would provide a total of 50,000 rewards points. Right now, a round trip flight from New York to San Francisco (May 15 to 22) costs $412 dollars on United Airlines, or 32,960 points. Subtract $187 from $412, and you're up $225 plus your remaining points.  You could even sign up for two travel rewards cards and split your tax payment to double up. The United Mileage Plus Explorer Card pays 30,000 miles if you spend $1,000 in the first three months. You would have 40,000 points from the Sapphire Preferred, 30,000 miles from United and 10,000 additional points between the two cards. You're a few purchases shy of a flight from New York to London for 80,760 points -- a value of $1009.50. An international flight on the IRS beats the pulp out of $13. And one little kicker: You can write off the credit card processing fee on next year's tax return.  Spread Your Payments Out with a Zero Percent APR Card Now, what if actually paying your taxes is much more of concern than getting a flight to London? The IRS offers an installment plan, but they set a quarterly interest rate at three percentage points over the federal short-term rate, which is currently at 0.28 percent. You'll pay $120 to set up a standard agreement, $52 for direct debit agreement or $43 if your income is below a certain level. In order to avoid penalties, you'll also have to make a minimum monthly payment.  Instead, you can sign up for a credit card that offers zero percent interest for at least one year and avoid paying interest as long as you pay off your balance fast enough. Credit cards only offer zero percent interest for an introductory period. For instance, the Citi Simplicity Visa Card provides a zero percent APR for the first 18 months. The Chase Freedom and Blue Sky from American Express both offer a zero percent APR for 15 months.  If you pay on time and clear your balance before the introductory rate ends, you will avoid paying any interest on your taxes. Before You Swipe...  Remember, if you use a credit card, you always run the risk of missing payments, accruing interest and damaging your credit rating.  Read the fine print -- some credit card providers can drop the promotional zero percent APR if you miss a payment. If that's the case, make sure you use auto payments and maintain a cushy balance in your checking account. Also, pay attention to your credit card utilization rate. If you have a $10,000 line of credit distributed across your cards and use $9,000, you hit a 90 percent utilization rate, which will hurt your credit score. If you miss your IRS installment payments, you get into legal trouble but not credit trouble. If you struggle to pay off your credit cards in a timely manner, swiping for taxes probably isn't for you. However, if you want a free flight to London or a breather from IRS interest rates, consider using a credit card and choose it carefully. "

      "text": "Paying for college is costly. But there are some tax benefits that can help parents who are footing the bill, or students who are independent. The time to understand those special deals is now -- before you file your 2013 tax return. According to H & R Block, these complex credits and deductions are often overlooked, or misused, costing taxpayers money.  While you may qualify for several of these benefits, you can only claim one on your return. So you'll have to do some figuring to decide which offers the best deal. If you go online to the IRS website, you can read Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Education to find details and charts of the eligibility rules. Here is a summary of the most significant deals. For each of the tax benefits discussed below, tuition must be paid to an accredited higher educational institution, which may be a college, university, or commercial certificate program. American Opportunity Credit (AOC) This credit can be claimed on the first $4,000 of qualified education expenses. It is 100 percent of the first $2,000 and 25 percent of the next $2,000, with a maximum credit of $2,500. The credit is up to 40 percent ($1,000) refundable. It can be claimed for each eligible student, assuming there is more than one in a family. This is a particularly attractive benefit because a credit is a dollar for dollar reduction of the taxes you owe. And up to $1,000 of this particular tax credit can be refunded -- paid out -- to the taxpayer if no taxes are owed! With a maximum credit of $2,500, this should be the starting place if the student qualifies. But there are some significant restrictions. The student must not have completed the first four years of post-secondary education as of the beginning of the taxable year. Also, this credit can only be claimed four times -- generally once for each undergrad year. The student must be enrolled in a degree or certificate program, be enrolled at least half time, and have no felony drug conviction. There is an income restriction for claiming the American Opportunity Credit. The benefit starts phasing out if a single filer has income over $80,000, and disappears completely at income over $90,000. For joint returns, the income limit for the full credit is $160,000, ending at $180,000. Either a parent or child can claim the credit on their return, however if the parents claim the child as a dependent, then the credit must be claimed on their return. Eligible expenses include tuition, fees, and any required course materials, such as textbooks or lab fees. Computers are qualified as expenses only when required as a condition of enrollment. But room, board, and other personal expenses are < Lifetime Learning Credit This credit is available for 20 percent of qualified expenses up to $10,000 with a maximum credit of $2,000. This can only be claimed once per return, no matter how many students are listed as dependents. And it cannot be claimed on the same return as the AOC, described above, although you could claim the lifetime learning credit for one student and the AOC for another student on the same return.  The maximum Lifetime Learning credit is smaller than the AOC at $2,000 per year. But there is no requirement that the student be working toward a degree. Like the AOC, it can be claimed by either parent or child -- but the child may not take the credit on his or her return if claimed as a dependent by a parent. The income limits for this credit are lower than the AOC -- $53,000 to $63,000 on a single return; $107,000 to $127,000 on a joint return. And similar educational expenses qualify for the credit as those listed above for the AOC, however only payments made directly to the institution are qualified. Tuition and fees deduction This is the last year for claiming up to $4,000 in deductions for tuition and fees. This benefit expired at the end of 2013, and has not been extended. A deduction is less valuable than a tax credit, which is why this is listed third. As with the two credits, there is an income limit of $65,000 (phasing out at $80,000) on a single return, and $130,000 (phasing out at $160,000) on a joint return. But there are complex rules pertaining to who may claim the deduction. If a parent taxpayer has paid the expenses and claimed the exemption for the student as a dependent, then the parent can take the credit. But if the dependent paid the expenses, then no one can claim the deduction! And if the taxpayer pays the expenses and does not claim the eligible student as a dependent, but could have done so, then no deduction is allowed. This is a murky area where the services of a tax provider or good tax software are essential. H&R Block has one more word of warning. If you received Form 1098-T from your school, detailing educational expenses paid, it likely will not reflect the total \"qualified\" expenses, because it will include scholarships paid to the educational institution. In fact, some portion of the scholarship money may be considered taxable scholarship income on Form 1040, Line 7. Or this income might be required to be reported on the parent's return under the Kiddie Tax provisions.  Deciding whether to claim a child as a dependent, or let the child file as an independent is far more complex than just the tax provisions. Emancipation may impact eligibility for other financial aid programs or even residency requirements. So there's a lot more to these decisions than just filling in a few lines on a tax form. Lindsey Buchholz is a principal tax research analyst at H&R Block's Tax Institute, who provided much of this analysis. She points out that all of these tax decisions have far reaching impact. If you want answers online to questions about college tax deductions (and almost every other topic), go to the H&R Block Tax Institute website Q&A service at www.hrblock.com/get-answers.  It seems you'll need that college education to make the right decisions about educational tax benefits. And that's The Savage Truth. "

      "text": "Huffington Post Reader Question Dear Steve, I have a ton of Parent Plus Loans to repay.  I am 62 years-old, still working but will be looking at retiring fairly soon.  My loan payments will be approximately $1,000 a month which will be more than half of my social security income.  Is there not any help for parents who \"had\" to take parent plus loans due to their income status which kept their student from getting more student loans? This is already creating a great deal of anxiety and depression for me. B.J. Don't miss my free my weekday email newsletter with the latest tips and advice on how to beat debt and do better financially. Subscribe now. - Click Here Dear B.J., Let's not allow the perceived hopelessness of your situation fester and lead to more debilitating anxiety and deep depression. There are some good options here. Since you are retiring \"fairly soon\" I would suggest you consider waiting till you retire, when your income will be lower, and then consolidate your Parent PLUS loans into a Direct Loan which would then be eligible for the lowest payment in the Income Contingent Repayment (ICR) program. If \"fairly soon\" is more than a year from now then you should consider consolidating them now and enrolling them in the ICR payment. You need to re-certify your income each year and a lower income in retirement will result in a lower payment. By enrolling now you can start to get credit for \"time served\" in the ICR. Sure, you'll probably never be able to fully repay the debt, although any remaining balance would be forgiven in 25 years. But in the meantime you'll get the lowest possible payment and any balance of your loans due will terminate when you naturally pass after a long and happy retirement. You can use the calculator on the bottom of this guide and learn more about all the plans and options that are available.

      "text": "Are you keeping money secrets from your spouse? Whether it's credit card spending or the secret cash stash, it's not healthy for a marriage to have secrets -- financial or otherwise. Broken trust and hurt feelings from financial secrets will put a wedge between a marriage. Often the damage is irreversible. Back in February, I wrote about five marital money mistakes couples make. The very first mistake was keeping financial secrets. I've wanted to expand on the five mistakes ever since. How do I admit I have a dark financial secret I've been keeping from my spouse? I'm no psychologist, but I've talked with hundreds of couples about money. Some are good and some are bad scenarios. But here's my advice on coming clean: Tell the Truth... the Whole Truth Start with just coming clean. That's half the battle! Admit that you have a financial secret. It really doesn't matter if it's secret offshore money or a simple debt on a department store credit card. Remember, don't leave out the details or try to sugar coat it. It's a mistake and we all make them. Remember this is not gender biased; I've seen both men and women do this. After your confession, sincerely apologize and ask for forgiveness. Be prepared for shock and anger. This will be a surprise to your spouse. If you are on the receiving end of the confession, try to react with understanding and compassion. Dig Deeper. What's it Really About? I've seen many people keep money secrets. Often there is a deeper issue going on. Addiction, compulsion and avoidance are habits that go with unhealthy financial decisions. If it's debt, then perhaps your spouse is compensating for being unhappy. Maybe you have been enabling or ignoring this behavior for some time. Really discuss why this started. Is it to fulfill something that is missing, or is it a legitimate addiction. Work As a Team Ask your spouse to work with you to tackle the debt. If it's an addiction, then agree to get help or counseling. Whatever it is, work together. If it is debt, then get another job to pay it off, or sell some junk. I don't want to get all corny and mushy, but remember why you became a team in the first place? To support each other through good and bad times. Continue to Communicate Once the crisis has passed, continue to talk and seek advice from your spouse. I see too many couples making financial decisions without talking through it first. Make a pledge that if a financial decision is over a certain amount, that you will consult each other first. By having these types of conversations, you'll continue to build trust. Stay On Track Stay positive and focused on being a financial team. You've come a long way from hiding and being ashamed. Continue to work together to eliminate the underlying causes of deceptive behavior. Money secrets will stress marriages. Keeping financial secrets, especially catastrophic ones, can lead to divorce. If you do discover a money secret from your spouse, avoid emotional reactions and try not to jump to conclusions. Remember that no matter how difficult finances get, working them out together is part of your marriage. It will make your relationship rich beyond your bank balance.

      "text": "If you are in your 20s and in debt it can seem like a gargantuan task to throw that monkey off your back. Do not despair my young friend. It may seem impossible to clear that debt, but it's actually much easier than you think. In fact, there are five steps you can take to turn your debt nightmare into a sweet dream before you know it. 1. Stop Digging If you want to hit a debt-free home run, you have to get to first base first. You do that when you stop making the problem worse. In other words, you first task is to discover what created your debt problem and put all your energy toward turning that around. For some people, this means earning more money. For others the solution is to track spending and cut back. Some people find they have to do a little (or a lot) of both. Whatever your circumstances, you are in debt because your income/spending ratio is out of whack. It's as simple as that. You may have acquired that debt as a result of bad spending habits you've since corrected or some major event (such as student loans). If the cause of the problem is in the past you are one step ahead of the game. That's great. But the bottom line is that you shouldn't do anything until you understand exactly why you are in debt and what you have to do to stop creating more. 2. Refinance Once you've stopped your financial ship from taking on more water, it's time to bail out that debt. Make a list of all your debt and include the amount, the payments you are making and the interest rate. Keep in mind that when you make your payments, most of the money goes towards interest and the remainder towards the principal debt. You create magic when you reduce the interest rate on your debt. That's because more of your payment will go towards reducing the principal and that means you'll be debt free much faster. Refinancing debt is a process. First, try to get your lenders to reduce the rate they are charging you. That may not be too successful, but it's worth a try. If one lender won't budge, you may be able to roll your credit card debt (for example) to another vendor. Once you've done all you can in that department, try to get your family to refinance your debt. If you decide to approach your kin make sure you have a rock-solid payment plan and show them what it is. Then, you need to stick to that plan to the letter. The last thing you want to do is burn those family bridges. Last, there is always the idea of peer-to-peer funding to reduce your interest costs. If you are stuck with a very high interest charge for credit card debt you may be able to roll that debt over to a private lender and reduce your rate big time. That can add up to some juicy savings too. 3. Do the Math At this point you've done all you can to slash your cost of debt. Notice, all this work hasn't cost you a dollar or involved any work. You've simply rearranged your debt to make it more manageable. Now it's time to roll up your sleeves and slay that debt dragon. My suggestion is to make minimum payments on all your debts except the one with the highest interest rate. Use every penny you can spare to wipe that highest cost debt off the map. This way you'll get rid of your most expensive problem first. Once the highest cost debt is gone, apply every penny you can towards the next highest cost debt. Continue this process until you are completely debt free. This isn't easy, but it is simple. It requires time, focus and action. But if you use this process and make it a priority in your life you'll be out of debt much faster than you would otherwise. Once you take care of the debt, you can turn your attention to the future. My experience is that people in their 20's have many unique opportunities to really accelerate their financial success once they get out of debt. What other steps do you recommend in order to get out of debt? "

      "text": " It's no secret that debt is a big problem. For the last few decades, we've become more and more comfortable using credit and putting off the pain of paying for things until later. The meltdown of the sub-prime mortgage market and the ensuing global financial crisis made a lot of us wake up and realize how much trouble we were in.  Yet today, it's still all too easy to get ensnared in a nasty debt trap that could derail your finances and prevent you from accomplishing your dreams. Here's a look at some of the most dangerous \"debt traps\" and how to avoid them: The \"Credit Card Rewards\" Trap It's true that rewards cards can be a powerful way to earn free trips and cash back, among other perks. But a significant number of people who sign up for those credit cards with the best of intentions end up going into debt. Why? Because it's just so easy to use good ol' credit card to make an extra purchase here and there. Before you know it, the rewards card has turned into a \"Get Into Debt Free\" card.  In order to avoid this trap, be realistic with yourself when thinking about applying for a rewards credit card. Ask yourself: will I be able to use this card responsibly and pay off the balance every month? If you have any doubt, skip the rewards card and focus on being debt free while you pursue your long-term financial goals. The \"Brand New Car\" Trap Do we deserve a brand new car? The people in those ubiquitous car commercials on TV certainly seem to think so: while we watch a sleek car drive along a picturesque mountain road, a voice tells us how easy it is to afford this year's model. \"It's just 36 monthly payments of $400!\" The problem is, financing a car with monthly payments puts you in the position of paying interest -- not to mention taking a huge chunk out of your income.  Rather than automatically looking to buy a brand new car (and take on the $20,000 of debt that goes with it), sidestep the hustlers and look for a good deal on a used vehicle. Oftentimes, cars that are 3, 5, or even 7 years old can still be quite reliable. And they cost far less. Use the money you've saved to balance your budget, start funding your retirement account, or save up for a house.  The \"Student Loans\" Trap The number of people taking out student loans to pay for college has skyrocketed in the last 30 years. There are several reasons for this, but one of the biggest is that the price of a college education has risen faster than the price of just about anything else. While some student loan debt may be necessary to achieve your education goals, today too many high school students are being told by their parents and teachers that student loans are a part of the college experience. Four years later, with a degree and $40,000 of debt, the students aren't so sure. If you're currently thinking of taking out student loans, proceed with caution. It may be that student loans will help you get a fantastic education and start you on a fulfilling and lucrative career path. But don't take anything for granted. Do plenty of research on alternatives to taking out student loans and talk to others to find out what it's like to pay off their loans after college. Making an informed decision will help you avoid regret later on. The \"Traveling the World\" Trap Travel is such a common desire among people of all ages that it's safe to say there's something human about wanting to explore the globe. However, traveling can be costly, and if you're putting off the travel expenses until later then you're going to wind up with a lot of debt as a result of your trip(s).  No one should get crushed by debt just because they want to travel. So how to avoid it? First of all, if you're planning a trip make sure you learn how to travel on a budget - before you leave the house. And even more important, save up the money for the trip beforehand so you know exactly how much you can spend - without any debt. The \"Looking My Best\" Trap It's amazing how easy it is to spend lots of money on clothing and other items whose purpose is to make you look good. While it's important to have clothes that fit well and make you feel your best, a lot of us take it too far. We think that wearing the latest trends is a must, and so we rack up tons of credit card debt on new shirts, jeans, shoes, and coats that we don't need.  To avoid getting buried in \"shopping\" debt, take a hard line with yourself. First, make a budget that includes a specific amount for clothing and other apparel. Then hold yourself accountable and stay away from the mall (and department stores) once you've reached your limit for the month. With a little planning and a little \"tough love\" you can keep yourself out of debt. Just remember to avoid the five debt traps above, and if you start thinking about making a purchase that will result in debt ask yourself what you can do instead. Your future financial picture will look a lot brighter as a result.

      "text": "There are less than two weeks left to sign up for health insurance before the Affordable Care Act's open enrollment March 31st deadline. If you are required to have health insurance and haven't purchased health care coverage by that date, you generally can't enroll in health coverage through the Health Insurance Marketplace after open enrollment, may face a tax penalty on your 2014 taxes filed in 2015, and must wait until the next open enrollment period unless you have a qualifying life event. If you already have insurance through your employer, Medicaid, Medicare or a private provider, you're covered and will not receive a penalty as long as your insurance meets minimum standards under the Affordable Care Act. If you're uninsured and have not yet enrolled in a health insurance plan, here are five things you should know and do before the deadline and penalty:  Find out if you're required to purchase health insurance. Under the Affordable Care Act, everyone is required to have health insurance or is subject to pay a tax penalty (in 2015 when 2014 taxes are filed) unless you meet a qualifying exemption. These exemptions include:  Additionally, if you are under the age of 26, you can stay on or be added to your parents' health insurance plan, even if you don't live with them. If you just had a birthday and turned 26, you will now be required to purchase health insurance by the March 31st deadline, unless you qualify for one of the exemptions mentioned above.  Find out if you're eligible for a subsidy. To help pay for the cost of health insurance, you may be eligible for financial assistance from the government, in the form of a subsidy. Your eligibility is generally determined by your household income and family size. You can quickly and easily find out if you qualify for a tax subsidy by using this health care calculator from TurboTax. If you qualify, the subsidy can go directly to your health insurance provider when you purchase insurance. This will lower your monthly health insurance payments or premium amounts. Know what you'll pay in penalties for not having health insurance. If you don't purchase health insurance by the March 31st deadline, you may face a penalty on your 2014 taxes (the return you'll file in 2015). The tax penalty is based on family size and income; however, there is no penalty for a gap in coverage less than three months within a single year. For 2014, the annual one-time penalty will be $95 per adult, or one percent of your total income depending on your income. For uninsured children in your household, the penalty is $47.50 per child with a maximum family penalty of $285. TurboTax has a penalty calculator that will estimate your tax penalty if you choose not to get health insurance. In tax years 2015 and 2016, the penalty increases quite a bit. The amount you owe will be pro-rated to the number of months you didn't have insurance.  Find out more about the March 31 deadline and the Affordable Care Act. You can find out more about the March 31 deadline and how the new law impacts you by visiting TurboTax Health, where you can find out if you're eligible for a subsidy, get an estimate of the subsidy, your out of pocket costs, and your tax penalty if you don't purchase insurance. You can use HealthCare.gov to apply for health insurance, compare plans, and enroll online. You can also apply by phone or get in-person help with your application.  Learn about your options if you miss the March 31st deadline. Unless you have a life changing event, like getting married or having a child, you have to wait until the next open enrollment period, which begins again on November 15, 2014 through February 15, 2015. If you do have a life changing event, you get a special enrollment period outside of the regular enrollment period, but must enroll in a health plan within 60 days of the life event. Do you have other questions about how to sign up for health insurance or how you might be impacted? Let us know in the comments. "

Chances are you'll probably end up spending it on something you don't really need. Why not make your money work harder for you? Here are four guilt-free ways to spend your tax money -- and get more in return. Watch the video. 1. Reduce your debt or increase your savings. It might not be the most fun way to spend your tax refund, but it is one of the smartest. Not only will you decrease the interest you're paying on your debt, which saves you money, you will also be lowering the period of time on which you are repaying your debt. If you don't have debt, put all or part of your refund into your savings account, 401(k), or investment accounts to make your money work harder. 2. Make improvements to your assets. If you own a home or car, you probably have some routine maintenance you've been putting aside. Put your refund money into fixing these problem areas and increase the value of your asset. 3. Invest in your health: Join a gym, get a trainer or buy new exercise equipment. Not only will you feel better mentally and physically, you will also avoid rising healthcare costs and might be eligible for other money-saving benefits. 4. Learn something new. Invest in yourself for long-term payoffs. Learning a new skill or trade that is useful to your industry can help boost your career trajectory and have long-term payoffs.

      "text": "By AJ Smith, Credit.com Taking the leap into home ownership is a big deal. Long considered the American Dream, it signals an entry into adulthood that some people crave. Millennials are joining the party -- the average first-time homebuyer in the U.S. is 31 years old. Before you join the ranks, here are some things to do. 1. Assess Your Need You don't want to be buying a home just because you turned 31 or because your friends have started doing it. Determine whether it's better for you to buy or rent at this time in your life. Think about your family and whether you have plans to marry or have children in the near future. Factor in your job and if it's stable, whether you plan to stay long term or if you are itching to try something new. Make sure you are buying a home because you want to and you are ready at this time. 2. Do the Math Many people focus on the down payment when they think about buying a home. Yes, the down payment is usually a large chunk of money. But there are other upfront costs you need to think about -- taxes, property insurance and closing costs for example. Insurance rates and property taxes will vary by state so you'll want to check on what it would be. Closing costs encompass many fees including origination, underwriting, appraisal and title insurance. It can add up to a surprisingly large number so it's good to know it ahead of time. 3. Be Ready You'll want to have all your documents ready to make the process go smoothly. In most cases, you will need government issued ID, a credit report (you can get free copies every year), a verification form from your employer, W-2 forms, federal tax returns and bank and asset statements. Some of these documents would also have helped you to figure out how financially ready you are to buy a home. For example, you want to make sure your credit is in great shape before you try to get a mortgage and pulling your credit reports can help you see where you stand. You can also check your credit scores for free using the Credit Report Card, a free tool that gives you grades on the major credit scoring factors so you know where you can improve your scores. 4. Check Out the Inventory A house is likely the largest purchase you'll ever make, so treat it like other large purchases. That means you want to shop around as you would for a car, TV or couch. It may be time consuming but it's important to look at comparable homes in the area. You could work with a licensed real estate agent or start your search online. You want to look at a variety of options to not only find the right one for you but to get a feel for the pricing in the area. 5. It's OK to Walk Away If you are not comfortable with the purchase, you may have to leave a near-perfect house for someone else to buy. Before you make this large of a purchase, you want to be sure you feel OK committing to a monthly mortgage payment. This post originally appeared on Credit.com.

      "text": "The director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) wants banks, particularly credit card lenders, to provide consumers with their free credit score on every one of their bills or statements as part of normal billing. Some people think it's a great idea and will help consumers, but others -- like some of the companies which charge for the information -- might not think it's such a great idea. Richard Cordray heads the CFPB, an agency that was put in place after the financial meltdown of the late 2000s. The mission statement of the agency is to \"make markets for consumer financial products and services work for Americans -- whether they are applying for a mortgage, choosing among credit cards, or using any number of other consumer financial products.\" Recently, the CFPB issued a report stating that common complaints from consumers are regarding errors in their credit reports. Following that release, Cordray sent a letter to the top brass at some of the biggest credit card companies, asking them to provide their customers with a free credit score -- but not the entire report -- on their monthly statements. \"At the Consumer Bureau, we are committed to helping consumers make sound financial choices. We are doing all we can to protect people by ensuring that consumer financial markets work better for them - are transparent, reliable, and fair. But we also recognize that the best form of consumer protection is self-protection, which means helping people avoid problems in the first place and knowing how to address problems when they do occur,\" Cordray said to the President's Advisory Council in February. This month, Cordray took a similar message to credit card company executives, stating that consumers may not know about errors on their credit reports or be prompted to attempt to fix them if they aren't aware of the problems. The thinking behind the idea is that regularly viewing one's credit score may help consumers become aware of problems more quickly. \"Every consumer who seeks to make use of credit to help manage his or her financial affairs is affected by this industry. For whether they are aware of it or not, people's ability to access credit, and how much they pay for credit, is typically governed by what is contained in their credit profiles,\" Cordray told the Consumer Advisory Board at a recent meeting. \"Assuring that such personal financial information is updated timely and accurately, and that it is maintained securely, is a critical responsibility.\" The issue becomes more complicated, though, because there are three major credit reporting agencies, and not all of them have access to the same information. Those three companies are Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. If that isn't confusing enough, there are other agencies out there that will calculate a credit score based on all three of those ratings. The most well-known of those is the FICO score, but it isn't alone in the game. Currently, some credit card companies offer a customer's credit score to them or access to it under certain programs. Discover cards were among the first to offer this service as a perk, and like most other companies doing this, offer the FICO score. Other companies who are in the business of calculating scores to provide to consumers and would-be lenders may not welcome a market which bolsters an already dominant brand, but if providing this information to consumers becomes standard on monthly statements, new opportunities may arise, especially for nimble, entrepreneurial companies. Smaller providers of credit information could conceivably prove to be creative and partner with the lenders to offer enhancements -- at a price -- to consumers. The big question now is whether or not it will actually happen. Shirley Pulawski is a freelance journalist who frequently contributes to MyBankTracker.com.  "

      "text": "I do love the art of minimalism. Minimalism is an approach that assumes less is more, or to simplify. Sometimes it can be really hard to implement in different areas of our lives. Especially with our finances. I think we all envision a world where money is simplified. Where our bills are paid, savings is applied automatically and financial perks are generously applied; however, there are endless options for credit cards, bank accounts, saving, organizing and yes, investments. It can be really overwhelming. Many of us have more than one option when it comes to these financial services. Making it less than minimal and simple. How then do you simplify your finances in a world that gives you so many choices? I'm glad you asked. I'll give you my financial minimalist approach. 1. Cash. Yep, cash is king. Using cash to make purchases is really simple. You don't have anything to sign at the register. Plus, you don't get a statement every month. If you pay with cash, there's no worries about overdraft, pin numbers or interest. What could be simpler? 2. Use only two credit cards. If you like using credit cards, then consider cutting those down to just two. One for everyday purchases and a second that has low interest when you have to carry a balance. You really don't need all those gas and department store cards. They all take these major cards. I love my American Express card because I pay the balance in full every month. 3. Automate. Let's start with direct deposit. I love this. My check is there on payday. No lines, no deposit and no bank holds. It's just there. You can also set up auto payment of your bills. This works great with recurring bills like your mortgage or car payment. You can automate your savings, too. Online banking allows you to transfer a set amount to transfer to savings every month. Voila! You are living a more simplified financial life. 4. Batch bill pay. Aside from a few bills that come in later in the month, I pay all my bills once per month. Why? I never really have to worry about due dates and it's much simpler. You get it over with. You also don't feel as though you are constantly paying bills. 5. Choose one financial institution. I've always had a hard time with this one too. I love my local credit union. I also love USAA, too. I've found a way to use both over the years for different things. If you really want to simplify your finances then just use one financial institution. There are added benefits other than simplicity too. When you consolidate these accounts you might be able to get better deals with credit and loans. 6. Go paperless. I resisted the whole paperless thing for a long time. I always worried that I would need that one piece of paper that I didn't keep! With tools like Evernote and Filethis, going paperless is really easy and efficient. Now I can search for any statement without going to a dozen different websites. Another couple of benefits of paperless is that it takes up less space and it's better for the environment. 7. Consolidate debt. If you have debt then try to have as few accounts as possible. Don't use the high interest debt consolidation loans! Try to use a reasonable zero interest credit card offer to consolidate. Just make after the offer expires that you aren't paying loan shark rates! 8. Consolidate investments and investment accounts.

I phoned clients and composed emails at my computer all day as sunshine lurked -- just feet away -- on the other side of my window. After work, I took a break to sit outside and eat my dinner. Just as I left my office, a slight drizzle began. Determined to get my taste of this welcome warmer weather, I pulled a chair under an awning and ate, taking in the gentle sound of raindrops, the occasional flecks of water hitting my skin and the colors of the sky and greenery around me. A friend had recently described feeling as though a piece of her soul was dying as she pursued a boring task at a lucrative job. Sitting there in my cocooned pocket of fresh air, I had the opposite sense. My soul felt rejuvenated. When I moved outside, my office-bound perspective gave way to a much broader perspective. It occurred to me that there was a world beyond my brain, my fingertips, my phone and my computer screen. The concerns that had recently filled my horizons became smaller and shifted into their rightful place in the larger context of the world. When I think of the third metric, I think of moments like this. And I also wonder: What are the metrics we use to measure how well we're incorporating the third metric values of well-being, wisdom, wonder, compassion and giving into our lives? It's quite clear how to measure money. We can count income, assets and the size of savings or investment accounts. Power is readily apparent by assessing our position in an organization or the extent of our sphere of influence. But we don't seem to have the same clear language or commonly-accepted means to describe and measure third metric excellence. Think of holiday newsletters, alumni updates or Facebook posts. We write about the big ups and downs, but we flat out ignore the daily practices that form the fabric upon which we create the tapestry of our lives. Have you ever seen anyone mention the number of minutes they meditated in a year in an alumni update? Or the quantity of friendly, kind gestures they made? Who talks about the number of times they paused to eat outside and appreciate the first glimpse of a changing season? It's these third metric activities that keep us well and whole. As Arianna Huffington puts it, they are the third leg that forms a stool that keeps the legs of money and power from toppling over.  It's high time we incorporated our accomplishments with third metric ideals into our daily vernacular. In addition to knowing things like how many hours we billed or the size of our paycheck, we might also know a number like 2,920. That's how many hours you would sleep in a year if you got eight hours of slumber each night. Read more about growing into a life and career you love at www.alisonelissa.com "

      "text": "As a consumer debt expert it is exceedingly frustrating hearing from people all around the country on a daily basis who are seeking good help for their student loan troubles, only to get really bad advice, or worse, ripped off. The scammers are ahead of the experts on selling student loan solutions. It's not unusual at all for me hear from people who were charged $20,000-$37,000 for student loan help that's available for free. I've got a couple of those client agreements sitting right here on my desk as I write this. Quite frankly the reason the scammers do this is because unaware consumers are easy pickings. Even student loan servicers are giving horrible advice. Call me cynical but one reason might be the servicers and collectors earn more by not telling you how to reduce or eliminate your loans for free. In fairness, I have observed some employees at some loan servicers trying to give best advice. To make the situation worse, people who you would think have a really good grasp on how to deal with student loans, like attorneys, don't. Not yet at least. For most this is new training and skills they were never taught in law school. One debt relief person just told me he tried to refer a consumer to an attorney for specific help and out of the 50 he tried to refer the consumer too, only three even had a clue what he was talking about. \"I'd love to tell you that most lawyers know how to deal with student loan problems but the reality is they don't. It's not that they are intentionally giving incorrect advice. The problem is they don't know what they don't know,\" said Joshua Cohen, a lawyer who spends a great deal of time training attorneys on how to deal with student loans. Another major contributor to the errant student loan advice given or sold to consumers by scammers is assumptions. People have heard for so long that there are no options or special relationships are required, that they believe that. My favorite line by scammers is, \"We can help because we have special relationships at the Department of Education.\" No they don't. And besides, you don't need one. People incorrectly believe they can't discharge their student loans in bankruptcy. That's not true because you can. While it might take specialized knowledge and some loans might be tough to discharge, others are simple and easy. Maybe you were given private student loans for more than the published cost of attendance at your school or university. Did you know the amount of the loans above the published cost is dischargeable in bankruptcy right now because that part of the loan is not a \"student loan\" as defined in bankruptcy.  Maybe you filed bankruptcy but were told your loans were not dischargeable. It's probably not to late to go back and fix that with a separate procedure.  If you need to find an attorney or someone who can deal with your loans for you, try here. Both private and federal student loans can be dealt with in bankruptcy. Look at these real world examples here and here. And let's say you get your wages or Social Security benefits garnished because of a student loan debt, or you are getting your tax refunds intercepted. That's not the end of the world either. In fact that's often easy to stop or reduce based on your circumstances. Even being sued by the Department of Justice is an opportunity to have to have your student loans reduced or eliminated. Read this. I fully admit there is a problem out there when it comes to dealing with problem student loans but from my point of view the problem is not that there are not good options available right now. The problem is most people just don't have a clue on what options are available to reduce or eliminate their unaffordable student loans so they fall for anything. And as crazy as this sounds, the reality is the higher the balances which are owed, the better the dollar reductions available. You don't need to be disabled, have a health problem, or dead broke to be eligible for real and meaningful help. Although if you are, getting reductions or eliminations is much easier. You also don't need to pay tens of thousands of dollars. You just need to be educated about what options are available.  Teachers, police officers, firefighters, military, education, public interest lawyers, and others are already eligible for a full and total federal student loan forgiveness for free if they just knew who and how to ask for it. Government programs even exist to reduce your regular student loan payments way down based on your current income. This is yet another free solution available from the Department of Education. Out of frustration or desperation I wrote this comprehensive free guide that will give you the information you need to begin to make smart and educated decisions and it shows you what programs are available.  Some might say I'm advocating just walking away from problem student loans. I'm not. What I am advocating is that legitimate help is already available for people who are buried in student loans, can't make the payments, have loans sitting on deferment or forbearance and getting bigger, desperate for real help, or don't have the ability to save for retirement. In a perfect world everyone would be able to repay their student loans without a problem. But then again we don't live in a perfect world, do we?

      "text": "Huffington Post Reader Question Dear Steve, Currently I an roughly $80k in student debt that I have been paying on for almost 4 years. 48k is in private Sallie Mae loans, 19k in Federal Loans, and about 7.5k in a Parent Plus loan I pay on. I initially went on the graduated repayment plan, and now the payments collectively have ballooned back to roughly $875 per month, which right now is well over half of my my monthly net income. I also face the daunting task over the variable monthly interest of my private loans which vary from 8-10.25% interest variable monthly. Having this much debt has crippled me in my professional life. I cannot get a loan for a car, home, or business despite a good credit rating of over 730. Of the almost $900 per month paid on the loans, almost 80-90% is going to interest. I want to do the responsible thing and pay off what I owe, but I cannot figure out a way to start getting ahead of it since I am already pouring almost all that I can into them per month. At this point I can never even imagine a reality of owning a home or business until these loans are paid off, which is still at least 10 years away. Is there anything I can do to make a solid impact on my debt, and start reversing the cycle? Beau Don't miss my free my weekday email newsletter with the latest tips and advice on how to beat debt and do better financially. Subscribe now. - Click Here Dear Beau, I hear you. Your situation is life-crushing but common among the people who contact me for help. When student loan debt begins to crush your life and rob you of the ability to save for retirement, action needs to be taken. What strikes me in general about your situation is the federal loans should be wisely consolidated in an Income Based Repayment program and an Income Contingent Repayment program for the PLUS loan. Those will give you the lowest payments available right now.  The Sallie Mae loans need to be looked at by someone who specializes in this sort of thing, like these folks. Sallie Mae loans are odd beasts. Some are eligible for federal programs, others are not, and some others can be easily discharged in bankruptcy. As an example, check this article. I would suggest you click here for more info on how to identify if your loans might be eligible. What I see is Sallie Mae typically tries to sell a $150 deferment or forbearance option which seems like it rarely resolves the problem. It just helps to grow the balance and magnify the problem.  The final option to consider if you can't pay truly private Sallie Mae loans is to stop. In some situations that makes sense even though there are consequences like getting sued. But more and more people seems to be settling this debt as well. The hardest part of your situation is going to be making sure you connect with a knowledgeable professional and not one of the many scam student loan assistance companies.

      "text": "I better come clean here. Yes -- I am a guy in finance, and \"dare\" to rent our home rather than own it. There is a philosophical aspect to this truth, but more importantly, also a deeply felt divide with most market observers over mathematical outcomes. Yes (again), I have seen, studied, and understood all the classic examples regarding purchase affordability, and yet my verdict goes to \"renting space\" as opposed to \"renting money\" (aka a mortgage). Part of my reasoning is simple: An investment that is illiquid, with little (or no) return possibility, and commonly levered 1:5 (80 percent of each dollar is financed at a cost) does not strike me to be attractive -- not even considering the opportunistic gain of other investments to be had. The common counterargument is twofold: 1) it is a home and not an investment (the little voice inside our heads: \"you gotta' live somewhere\"), and 2) the financing cost can be partially deducted from income for tax purposes. Both are bonkers! First, a home can be rented as well, and the thought that a fulfilled life can only be achieved through ownership (an integral part of the American Dream) is simply inaccurate. Second, a purchasing decision based on tax considerations may be worthwhile, but this should not lead the decision-making process. With this in mind, many tax systems outside the U.S. promote real estate ownership by way of deductions related to investment properties only, but not linked to primary residences. Our neighbors in Canada \"suffer\" from this very tax structure, and yet average homeownership is higher across our northern border at 69 percent, compared to the U.S. at 65 percent. Philosophically, my family likes the flexibility to be able to \"pick up\" whenever opportune, for personal or professional reasons. In fact, research has concluded that an increase in the rate of homeownership will lead to an increase in unemployment, mainly due to lower flexibility in labor mobility. Then there is the personal aspect: My common joke is that on the day when you encounter all the Wall Street bankers in their weekend skinny jeans, you may want to remove the \"cool\" from your neighborhood description, as the local real estate, likely, is no longer affordable for aspiring young artists and the like. If you are in New York, think of Chelsea, TriBeCa, and especially Brooklyn -- all of this has played out already. In \"Why I Rent and Would Never Buy,\" architect and urban designer Ben Pentreath describes the appealing socioeconomic diversity of a small council estate village in West England, which is purely based on the fact that houses can only be rented. This aspect allows for more traditional neighborhood structures, with furniture makers, writers, mechanics, and young families living door to door.  Of course, what remains is noise, for example, \"Why 2014 is a good year to buy a home\" or the double-digit year-over-year rise of real estate prices. When applying one of the many buy vs. rent calculators, it becomes clear that large metropolitan areas (e.g., NYC, LA, SF) remain very expensive, and that buying trumps renting only if one is in for the very long run (or when discounting property taxes).  There is opportunity in all of this. Policymakers can make real estate more affordable, and one viable option may be to improve the outdated U.S. transportation system. Think, for example, of a high-speed train connecting Philadelphia to New York City, and what it would do to the prices of \"commutable\" real estate. Further, it is important to recognize that an independent(?) Federal Reserve Bank, with an objective to maintain artificially low credit cost, may trigger poor buying decisions and artificially inflate the value of real estate. We need to be reminded that affordability is not simply a function of cash flow, but a price and expected value consideration, after all. "

      "text": "By AJ Smith, Credit.com When it comes to buying a house, you have to make lots of decisions. You have to figure out which neighborhood you want, which school district, how much of a down payment to make, etc. One of these decisions is whether you will take out a fixed-rate or adjustable-rate mortgage. The Difference A fixed-rate mortgage is the most common kind of mortgage. The interest rate and monthly payment (principal and interest, excluding tax and insurance) with this kind of mortgage remains the same throughout the life of the loan. Adjustable-rate mortgages will start off with lower interest rate than comparable fixed-rate mortgages. But the interest rate of an ARM can change. When it does, the payment will go up if market rates are going up, and down if rates are dropping. There are caps that limit how much your payment can change, but some people experience \"payment shock\" when mortgage payments rise. If you choose an ARM, make sure you understand how high your payments could go. Hybrid Mortgages Hybrid mortgages, as the name suggests, give you a mix of both types of mortgages. Specifically, you'll start with a fixed rate for a set time (often five, seven or 10 years). For that initial period, you will know for certain what your principal and interest payments will be. When that time is up, your mortgage rate can change, generally adjusting annually. If a mortgage is called a \"5/1 ARM,\" that means it has a fixed rate for five years, and that it adjusts once a year after that. Which Mortgage to Choose As with so many personal finance questions, the type of mortgage that's right for you depends very much on your situation. The standard advice is if you plan on living in your home for only a few years, you might want to think about an ARM or hybrid. You would save money because the interest rate for the ARM would be lower during those initial years than the fixed rate mortgage. Of course, as the recent recession and housing crisis taught us, you can't always sell a house when you want to. So if you choose an ARM, you need to be prepared to pay the maximum allowable interest rate. Fixed-rate mortgages offer the security of knowing your principal and interest payments will be the same for the life of the loan. If rates increase, you don't need to worry about it; if they decrease, you can consider refinancing. You can also refinance from an ARM to a fixed-rate mortgage to lock in a lower interest rate for the longer term. Should You Refinance? So let's say you are in that very position -- with an adjustable-rate mortgage, thinking about refinancing to lock in a lower interest rate. Interest rates aren't as low as they were a short time ago, but they are still in historically low territory. But there are some things to consider -- the rate (and limits) of your current loan, the value of your home, your equity in the home and the current interest rate. There are significant upfront costs when it comes to refinancing (you'll pay closing costs), so if you plan to sell your house soon, it might not be the best decision. Ultimately, you have to look at your individual situation and financial goals to determine if refinancing to switch from an ARM to a fixed-rate mortgage makes sense for you.

Now, though, this conflict can hit home the way global tensions so often do: It could cost you money. There is nothing wrong with a little enlightened self-interest guiding foreign policy views, especially when the rights and wrongs of a situation are as muddled as they are in this case. It is easy to condemn Putin's heavy-handed actions, but here are some important facts to keep in mind: None of this excuses Putin's actions, but it does help explain them. This background is worth considering before the U.S. has a knee-jerk reaction that only raises the stakes. Plus, there is one more thing to consider: If the U.S. is to have a role in this dispute, it might be best for the nation's economy for that role to be to broker a solution rather than to escalate tensions by taking sides. Global wild cards This is not the only geopolitical situation that could boil over at any minute. China, having simmered for decades over its territorial disputes with Japan and Taiwan, could take a cue from the Russians and try to force the action. Plus, of course, conflict in the Middle East is a constant, and always seems to find a new front on which to break out. Here are four reasons global disputes matter to American household economics: Come election time, they say that Americans traditionally vote pocketbook issues over foreign policy. In today's global economy, though, it is getting harder to distinguish the two. "

      "text": "This article was written by Simon Moore, CFA, MBA, of FutureAdvisor for Manilla.com The investment choices for 401(k) retirement plans are menus with some great options, like low-cost diversified index funds, some mediocre ones, like most mutual funds, and one choice that makes little sense at all. That's buying stock in your employer. It's like a vegetarian restaurant decided that right under its soups and salads, it would offer health-conscious clientele a solid slab of butter at a cut-rate price. Too much butter will give you heart disease, and too much employer stock will give you a bad retirement. People hold too much employer stock in their 401(k)s In plans that allow it, almost one in five of all of 401(k) dollars is invested in employer stock, according to 2013 data from the Investment Company Institute (ICI) and the Employee Benefits Research Institute (EBRI). Seasoned financial advisers would caution against large exposure to any single stock, let alone one's employer. After all, your entire salary is already a bet on that one company -- there's no need to increase your exposure. Even worse, some people hold lots of employer stock. The same EBRI report found that 7 percent of retirement savers held more than 80 percent of their 401(k) in employer stock. Now that's loyalty. But it's doing savers little good. For these people, betting most of their retirement investments on a single company is extremely risky. Even though the S&P 500 gained more than 20 percent over the past 12 months, about 70 stocks on the NYSE and NASDAQ have fallen by more than half in that period, according to Financial Exchange Protocol data. This is sort of stock decline is a terrible outcome for employees who were backing these companies with their 401(k)s. They just downsized their golden years. These companies show how engaging in stock picking with your 401(k) can be extremely risky. A few examples of employer-stock risks According to Google Finance, Journalists at the New York Times, many of whom were heavily invested in the premier American newspaper, saw its stock dive from more than $51 in 2002 to less than $5 in 2009. An order of magnitude decline that ruined many plans made for retirement. The poster child for this type of mistake is Enron, an energy trader once based in Houston, which declared bankruptcy in 2001. Some married couples who worked together at the company lost nearly a million dollars from their retirement savings. Diversification would have saved them a lot of grief. Enron is not an isolated example. Lehman Brothers, WorldCom, Chrysler, Washington Mutual and General Motors all show that large bankruptcies, often of companies that are household names, happen frequently. The nature of the free market means your employer is also free to fail. Make sure you don't go down with them, no matter how promising they seem now. It's tempting, but risky Some argue that if their employer does well, the stock will rise in value. That's true, but if your employer does well, you will benefit in many other ways. You career prospects may improve and your pay is more likely to increase. You are already invested in your employer more than you think. It's also tempting to think that you should invest in what you know, and so hold your employer's stock. In fact, a low-cost stock fund offers a much less risky way to track the growth of America's best companies without being over exposed to any single one. What to pick instead Look for a low-cost broad stock fund for most of your retirement savings. Balance out the risks of holding stocks, which do well in the long term but can fall sharply and unexpectedly in the short. Expose your savings to bonds, real estate assets and inflation-protected securities. So as you approach retirement, gradually reduce your stock exposure in favor of bonds and inflation protected securities. Just because there's junk food for sale at the supermarket doesn't mean you should buy it. And just because employer stock is a 401(k) option doesn't mean you should choose it. You probably have more financial exposure to your employer than you realize, and investing more in that one stock could put your retirement at risk.

      "text": "Many consumers can relate to the frustration of having to pay an additional fee when using a credit card. The precious cash back or rewards that you'll earn are negated by that extra cost. Some merchants charge such a convenience fee, while others do not, which leads consumers to wonder what justifies such a practice. Q: There is a local nail salon that I frequently visit, and I usually have cash on hand. But, this one time, I had to use a credit card and I discovered that the salon added a $1 convenience fee to the $15 charge. Can they do that? I don't see my local drugstore do something like this for a small amount. - Bonnie S. A: Technically, convenience fees are applied when a consumer uses an alternative payment channel. For instance, a college student or parent may face a convenience fee when using a debit or credit card to pay a tuition bill online or by telephone (as opposed to mailing in a check). A convenience fee is different from a surcharge, which is an added charge for the privilege of using a credit card, instead of a debit card or cash. When a small mom-and-pop shop slaps on a small \"convenience fee\" for an in-store purchase with a credit card, it is likely confusing the term for a surcharge. Under a 2012 ruling, merchants cannot impose a credit card surcharge of more than 4 percent of the transaction. A flat $1 surcharge would be illegal on a $15 purchase since it exceeds the maximum surcharge limit of 4 percent. Also, credit card surcharges are prohibited in California, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Kansas, Maine, Massachusetts, New York, Oklahoma and Texas. However, merchants are allowed to provide discounts for payments in cash, which is commonly seen at gas stations. The rule is that they must display prices for both credit card and cash payments together. If the salon has presented a price list for the two different payment methods, it followed the rules. If it didn't, that \"convenience fee\" should not be allowed. Credit card networks tell consumers to report businesses that impose illegal surcharges to their state's attorney general.

      "text": "In our Money Mic series, we hand over the podium to people with controversial views about money. These are their views, not ours, but we welcome your responses. Today, one man shares how he's tackling one of the biggest debts many of us will ever take on: a mortgage.  August 1, 2012, will forever be a day etched in my memory. It was the day my lifelong dream of being a homeowner finally came true, and I moved into a beautifully renovated three-bedroom bungalow in the suburbs of Toronto, Ontario. I purchased my home for $425,000, and through all my years of hard work and financial discipline, I was able to make a sizable down payment of $170,000, which left me with a five-year fixed rate mortgage of $255,000 at 3.04 percent. Six digits of debt are intimidating, especially when you're a single homeowner. But at 29 years old and just 15 months after buying my house, I've already paid $100,000 off my mortgage.. and I plan to pay the other $155,000 off before I turn 31. How did I do it? Let me explain. A House Starts With a Dream Ever since I was 10 years old, I've dreamed of being a homeowner. That's when I was sitting at the dining room table at my mother's house and heard that my aunt, who had lived paycheck to paycheck and rented an apartment her whole life, had been laid off from her job after 20 years and would have to move in with my grandmother. There was no way I ever wanted to find myself in that situation, middle-aged and unemployed with no savings in the bank. So I started saving toward my first home even before I graduated from university. While in school, I worked three part-time jobs (meat department clerk at a supermarket, administrative assistant at my university's MBA office and freelance writer), earning over $10,000 annually. Instead of taking summers off, I worked full time as an administrative assistant in a government office, earning another $10,000 per summer, enough to cover the next year's tuition. After a 60-hour workweek I was exhausted, but I knew I wanted to graduate debt-free. RELATED: 7 Federal Student Loan Repayment Options: What You Need to Know I've always been a saver, so frugality was second nature to me. I purchased my textbooks secondhand, cycled and rode public transit. I limited myself to coffee once a week with friends and only went out when it benefited my career. Food is a major expense for students, so packing my lunch was a no-brainer -- I estimate that saved me at least $5,000 a year. I graduated university debt-free, with a net worth of $70,000. (I should mention here that while universities are similar to those found in the U.S., post-secondary education is a lot more affordable here in Canada -- while a private university could cost $200,000 in the U.S., the cost of a similar four-year degree in Canada would be more like $80,000.) RELATED: How I Did It: Applied for 100 Scholarships After eight months of working in a supermarket post-graduation, I was fortunate to land a full-time job in the financial industry, earning $32,000. I opened an investment account and started contributing $250 weekly toward investing in mutual funds to save for my home. I was a disciplined saver -- even after graduation I continued to live like a student in the basement of my mother's home, paying $600 a month in rent. Through my full-time and part-time jobs and my freelance work, I was able to save an additional $110,000, bringing my net worth to $180,000, in only two and a half years. First-Time Homebuyer.. and First-Time Landlord The most difficult part of becoming a homeowner wasn't saving toward my down payment -- it was purchasing a home in a seller's market. After nearly two years of house hunting and the same number of failed offers, I started to wonder if I should put my dreams of homeownership on hold. I was in danger of being priced out of the market as home prices climbed faster than my savings. RELATED: What's Happening in Real Estate in 2014 In the September after graduation, even before I landed my salaried job, I was sitting on the couch at my parents' house, watching HGTV's Income Property with my mom like I did every Thursday night, when I had an idea: To achieve my dream of owning a home and paying down the mortgage as soon as possible, I would follow in the footsteps of host Scott McGillivray -- who lived in the basement of his first house for eight years to get financially ahead -- and rent out the main floor of my future home. Now I just needed to find that home! After three years of house hunting, I finally found it in June 2012. It was love at first sight: a newly renovated, one-story bungalow with a basement apartment in a great location near Lake Ontario, only 15 minutes from my parents. I was fortunate to avoid what I dreaded most, a bidding war, as the seller was moving to Alberta and wanted to sell quickly. The seller accepted my offer of $425,000, and two months later, I rented a moving truck and moved in my worldly possessions. After a grueling day of moving and unpacking, I stood in the living room, admiring my new house and staring out the bay window. The journey of becoming a homeowner was tough, but at that moment, it was well worth it. RELATED: So You Say You Want to Be a Landlord I hadn't abandoned my original plan: I would live in the basement and rent the main floor in order to pay off my mortgage. My real estate agent was nice enough to help show my property to prospective tenants in July 2012, before I even moved in, and soon I had rented out the house. I've been very lucky: My tenants, first a young couple around my age and now a family, have been great. Paying Down My Mortgage -- at All Costs I currently work as a pension analyst at a pension consulting firm, earning $48,825 a year. On the weekends I work part time at a supermarket, earning $10,000 a year. I also have a freelance writing business, and 2013 was my most successful year ever -- I earned over $20,000. I currently rent the main floor of my house for $1,550 per month. My family and friends often wonder why I am so determined to pay off my mortgage so quickly, since it's technically \"good debt.\" Besides my mortgage, I'm debt-free. Paying down my mortgage provides me with a guaranteed rate of return (unlike the stock market), and as a single homeowner, if I ever lose my job, I won't have to worry about my mortgage -- and the rent from upstairs will be more than enough to cover my household expenses. I've taken full advantage of mortgage prepayment privileges (many closed mortgages allow you to pay an annual, penalty-free percentage ahead of time, to cut down on interest). I've doubled up my mortgage payments, paying $850 weekly, made lump sum payments whenever I received checks for freelance writing income and increased my mortgage payments 15 percent each year. Last year I managed to max out my mortgage prepayment privileges in only four months. When it comes to spending money, I've continued to be frugal. By cycling and taking public transit to work, I've been able to save over $6,000 a year, which is the real cost of owning a car, according to personal finance columnist Rob Carrick. I don't have a mobile phone (I use MagicJack Plus, an internet-based telephone service, instead) or cable (I stream TV shows via online Canadian websites like www.cbc.ca and www.ctv.ca), which saves me about $1,800 annually. Today, I have a net worth of $450,000, which includes my house, investments, emergency fund and retirement savings. If all goes according to plan, I will be mortgage-free by age 31. For me, that means the weight of the world will be lifted off my shoulders, and I'll have the freedom to pursue my other passions -- like freelance writing full time, or penning a personal finance book to share my experiences with others -- and be able to start saving toward my next goal: retiring early at age 55.

      "text": "This might be a shocking title coming from a guy who is in the financial planning business, yet I'm sticking with it because it's true. How can you have a plan specific to your finances? Can you really separate your financial plan from your life plan? When the question in the title is asked like this, our brain goes from our life to our finances, immediately narrowing the scope of our thoughts and vision. For example, you could be walking down the street minding your own business, thinking about the great and wonderful things you have planned for your life, your career and your family, and then some jackass comes along and asks you about your financial plan. Your answer may sound something like this: I actually don't know. I have a bunch of things going on right now. I have bills to pay and debt to manage. My retirement account is out there somewhere and your guess is as good as mine as to whether I'm contributing enough or investing correctly. My job takes up a lot of my time and I don't make as much as I think I should. Fortunately, we save enough for short-term family vacations to release some of the stress, but other than that, I really don't have much of a financial plan. It's amazing how the word \"finances\" immediately throws us head-on into our current circumstances. From this standpoint you may not see many options for what to do from a personal financial perspective. Guess what? That's completely natural. When it comes to planning for your future, finances are only a part of the process, albeit, an important one. If you step back and take into account everything that comes into play when planning for your future, you can view your finances as simply a tool in the toolbox that you can use to help you along the way. Centering the conversation on this one tool does not work. It's like heading out on the golf course with nothing but a 7 iron (I actually had a friend who played 18 holes with this one club... and it wasn't pretty). I've created a process for you to use for this big picture planning. It's called Dare to D-R-E-A-M: Discover... the life you love, Recognize... the obstacles in your way, Evaluate... your current financial circumstances, Architect... a roadmap for your future, and Mobilize... and get into action. From this standpoint, you can look beyond your current circumstance and envision a life that you truly want to live. By brainstorming different choices, your mind will naturally expand and you may start to think about what you really want, and not simply what your current circumstances will allow you to have. That's a big difference! Once you have established what you want, the next step is to identify the obstacles that are in your way. What are the physical, emotional, financial circumstances and beliefs that keep you where you are today? These are like the monster under the bed. Once a child takes a look and sees that the monster doesn't look so scary, she can go to sleep soundly. This is no different for you. It's often the fear of the unknown that stops you in your tracks. Shine a light on that unknown and suddenly it's not so bad. From here you can actually check your current financial circumstances, taking a look at cash flow (income and expenses), assets (home, car, investment accounts, etc.), liabilities (typically this is debt: credit cards, mortgage, car loan, etc.) credit score, benefits through work... and the list goes on. At this point you have identified where it is that you want to go (a life plan if you will) and pinpointed where you are today. Establishing these two points is of utmost importance, because it allows you to start the fourth step which is to architect the roadmap for your future. This is the easy part as it's simply a game of connect the dots, simply asking yourself the question, \"How do I get from point A to point B?\" Finally, and most importantly, once your roadmap has been drawn up, it's time to take action! The best plan in the world is nothing more than a bunch of well-constructed thoughts unless you execute it. Taking small actions often will have you move forward and that's the key to achieving any goals. It's this type of planning that makes what I do worthwhile. Simply focusing on the financial circumstances of your life makes it hard to get out of your own way. Take a stab at working through the D-R-E-A-M process and let me know how it goes by commenting below. I think you'll see things for what they are, and from there, the power is in your hands. It's no longer your financial plan... it's your life plan. Sign up for the Views From Your Hammock e-newsletter to receive more thought provoking information. Video Powered by Bank of America: "

      "text": "Chris Walters, PolicyGenius Contributor Although the March 31 deadline to buy personal health insurance and avoid a tax penalty is only a few weeks away, a couple of new reports show that the two groups that stand to benefit the most -- the poor and the uninsured -- are barely participating. The incredibly low participation rates from the poor and uninsured are even more surprising considering the onslaught of media coverage and promotional campaigns that have been running for months now. Despite everything, there's clearly still a large information gap. So maybe it's time to take a more personal approach. If you know people in your family or circle of friends who still haven't shopped for health insurance on one of the marketplaces, either because they're worried about the cost or because they have no idea how it all works, feel free to use the information below to help clear things up. It matters because after March 31st most Americans won't be able to buy a policy through the health insurance marketplace again until November 14th, and that means they could possibly face a tax penalty (a small one, but still) when filing their 2014 taxes next year. Excuse #1: \"I haven't bought health insurance because I can't afford it\" For some this is sadly true even with the new cheaper plans, but at least those people are unlikely to face a tax penalty next year for not buying a policy. For everyone else who says this -- including all those people identified in the McKinsey survey who are eligible for health insurance subsidies but don't know it -- now is a good time to spend the 2 to 3 minutes it takes to find out your subsidy status. (Yes, it happens that fast.) If you can go online, here's a chart that shows qualifying income ranges for the health insurance subsidy. If your income falls within the eligibility range, then you have your choice of two free interactive tools to help you find out exactly how much money you can get. Option A (more streamlined): Kaiser Family Foundation's Subsidy Calculator (English) Option B (more educational, better for absolute newbies): Health Tax Credit Tool (English) Cr\u00e9dito Fiscal de Salud (Spanish) If you need an offline tool, Consumers Union (the organization that publishes Consumer Reports) offers free downloadable brochures in English and Spanish for every state. They're very clear and explain how the subsidy works and how to determine your eligibility. (Be sure to choose the version in the first column, because it's the one that includes a phone number you can call for further help.) Any subsidy you qualify for is applied directly to the monthly premium of the plan you purchase. For example, if you qualify for a $100/month subsidy and buy a plan that's normally $200/month, you'll only have to pay $100/month ($200 minus the $100 subsidy). Excuse #2: \"I don't know what information I'll have to provide\" When you shop on the marketplace, you'll need to provide enough personal information to prove your identity. If for some reason the marketplace can't confirm you're who you say you are, you might be asked to provide other types of proof. In addition to personal information you'll be asked to give your estimated income for 2014, and any subsidy you receive will be based on that number. Next year when you file your 2014 taxes, the amount on your tax return will be compared to what you submitted to the marketplace to make sure they match. If you should have received a larger subsidy, you'll get that difference paid to you in a refund. If you should have received a smaller subsidy, you'll have to pay back the difference. If you want to know more about the verification process, Consumer Reports has a brief but detailed overview. If you want to know what the actual shopping experience is like, we published a detailed account titled, \"What no one tells you about shopping the ACA health insurance exchanges.\" Excuse #3: \"I can't access the website\" Not everyone can go online and spend the hour or two it can take from start to finish, but fortunately you can do it all over the phone. Here's a list of every state's marketplace help line. You can also find your state's phone number printed on the brochures we mentioned above, so if you're planning on explaining all of this to someone offline, be sure to print that out to bring with you. So what do you do next? If you're looking to take the next step we've put together a handy checklist detailing how to go about shopping on the exchanges. PolicyGenius is an independent site that offers unbiased advice and easy shopping for all lines of consumer insurance "

      "text": "The top three tax scams in the IRS \"Dirty Dozen Tax Scams for 2014\" are Identity Theft, Telephone Scams, and Phishing. Each of these relate to stealing a taxpayer's identity information, personal information, and financial account information through various means including dumpster diving and pretending to be an IRS employee through threatening emails or telephone calls.  Prevention: IRS employees do not call and threaten to take your license, put you in jail, or deport you for not making a tax payment. They also do not send emails requesting payment information via your financial account or credit card. If you do receive one of these calls, make sure you get the contact information including name, phone number and badge number of the caller. Then contact the IRS at 800-829-1040. The IRS employees at the main IRS Help Line can help you determine if the call or email you receive is legitimate, and they can help you with any payment issues you may have with the IRS. If you know you do not owe any taxes, and you get a call or email saying that you do, once you and your tax professional determine the request is fake, consider contacting the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) at 800-366-4484. I can't stress enough, do NOT provide your personal information to an email request or phone request from the IRS especially if you did not initiate the contact. The IRS will not contact you by email and rarely by phone to request your personal information. If there is an issue, or a payment due, you will receive a paper letter in the mail.  Take action: If you suspect your personal information has been stolen or compromised, call the IRS Identity Protection Specialized Unit at 1-800-908-4490 or complete IRS Form 14039, Identity Theft Affidavit, and report the theft to the IRS. You will be required to provide information concerning when and how you realized you were a victim of identity theft or describe an event involving your personal information, such as a data breach, that my affect your federal tax records in the future. You will be asked to provide a copy of either: your passport, driver's license, Social Security Card, or other valid U.S. federal or state government issued Identification, in order to prove your are the real you and establish your identity for next steps. The IRS recommends you file a police report to further protect yourself. They will share information about the ID Theft with the appropriate law enforcement agencies. The IRS has an identity theft assistance system that helps people who have been victimized. In particular they have a program that issues an additional secure identification number, the Individual Protection Personal Identification Number (IPPIN), to secure your tax records and ensure the processing of your tax return is not held up during the processing cycle while a tax return with a duplicate Social Security number is investigated. The IPPIN is a six-digit number issued annually by the IRS to all taxpayer's who have had their identity compromised and have completed Form 14039 reporting the compromise. The number is an additional layer of security and must be included on your tax return when you file. To get your IPPIN go online to www.irs.gov/getanippin or contact the IRS Help Line. You will be asked to answer some personal questions to verify your identity. If you use the IRS Help Line, your IPPIN request will be delayed. Once your ID Theft case is processed by the IRS, you will have an internal IRS identification flag on your file and you must have a new and unique IPPIN issued to you each year. This system keeps other individuals from being able to file a tax return with your name and Social Security number as only you have the IPPIN information. Computer software vendors allow the entry of the IPPIN in their software, however if you are mailing a paper tax return, make sure you enter the IPPIN in the appropriate box next to your signature on any of the Form 1040 series tax forms. The IPPIN may be used to file only one tax return per year and you must get a new IPPIN each year.  Beginning this year, spouses of taxpayers who use an IPPIN must have their own IPPIN. Also new for this year, the IRS is testing a pilot program for taxpayers from Florida, Georgia, and the District of Columbia who have NOT been a victim of ID Theft or a victim of a data breach potentially leading to ID Theft. At the taxpayers option they may apply for acceptance into the IPPIN program by using the online IPPIN application process before filing their return this year. In other words, the IRS is testing out optional participation in the IPPIN program for taxpayers. If you chose to join the IPPIN Program, you must get a new IPPIN each year. This program is a safe and secure way to further protect your tax return and personal and financial information associated with a tax return. There will be more information to come on this trial program after the IRS has a chance to review how it went this year.  At the end of the day there is certainly more risk today for identity theft and personal information misuse and abuse. However there is also increased help out there, but to start you need to invest the time and focus to protect yourself. Do not provide your personal and/or bank account information, or make a payment when contacted by phone or email without first verifying the request independently. Be mindful of where you use your credit/debit cards, and keep track of everything in your wallet, so you can report it right away if lost or stolen. And remember, protecting your tax information is just as important as protecting your wallet and perhaps even more so. "

      "text": "As I write this, today is the day for me to go file my annual taxes. For me, it's an event that always has a certain degree of anxiety and frustration. Getting all the docs together, then having to hear the bad news. Not if, but how much, I owe. I'm self-employed so I'm always making tax payments. Have I told you how much I hate taxes?  The average tax refund is around $3,000. If you are lucky enough to get a refund. That may not sound like a lot, but there are some interesting ways to leverage that return.  How do you leverage, give or take $3,000, into something more? Take a look: 1. Do a financial plan. You know I never resist to tell you about the benefits of financial planning. According to NAPFA (National Association of Personal Financial Advisors) the average financial plan runs about $2,000 to $5,000. So your refund is right in the wheelhouse! By spending those dollars to have a plan prepared, it will make you much more knowledgeable about your complete financial picture. It will show you where you have some shortfalls or even save you money. This would be an excellent way to spend this year's refund. 2. Pay off debt. Need I even say this? If you have some nagging bills like we all do, why not get rid of them? That left over medical bill or even some holiday bills. Pay off any debt or apply the money to a larger debt that is charging you interest. Your best bet would be to apply this to the highest interest debt that you have. Typically a credit card. This will save you thousands of dollars over time, and is a great way to leverage your tax refund. 3. Contribute to a Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is an IRA that the contributions are not taxed once they are removed. As long as you meet a few criteria, like keeping the Roth for five years. So with a Roth you'll get tax free growth and tax free withdrawals. So your tax refund could be leveraged to achieve tax free money for retirement. Depending on how long it's investing, this could be a nice little nest egg. Leverage! 4. Buy a Long-Term Care policy. The average refund I mentioned will probably only buy one long-term care policy. However, having a policy on yourself or even your elderly parents could be very beneficial. The average long term care stay is about $60,000 in Kentucky...per year! So the policy you select could not only take care of you or a parent, but also protect financial assets from the devastation of a long term care stay.  5. Take a course on personal finance. Most of your local colleges and community colleges offer courses on various personal finance topics. An investment in knowledge always pays dividends. What better way to leverage your tax refund that making yourself smarter about your money? Some of these classes could be offered at a local community center or a public library for free! 6. Start an emergency fund. Your tax refund probably won't fund this account completely. However, if you don't have one, or a very small one, it could really benefit you. Having an emergency fund will keep you from tapping credit every time the car breaks down, or there is a badly needed fix at your home. Potentially saving you loads of greenbacks from not going into debt. Another way to leverage your refund. 7. Start your own charitable foundation. It really doesn't require that much money to start your own charitable foundation. You literally can do it for any person or cause that is important to you. You can use your refund to benefit the needs of others. Spend a little of it to advertise your foundation and get additional donations. Who knows you could be a great philanthropist like Warren Buffet or Bill Gates! This is not a complete list, but a creative one. Each suggestion can really leverage the tax refund dollars substantially. If you liked my article, why not subscribe for free right here!

      "text": "When a married couple purchases a house with the help of a mortgage, they become subject to a wide range of legal rules and custom-based practices at every stage of the process. This article will summarize some of the major issues that arise.  Qualifying For a Standard Mortgage: If both of the parties have incomes, these can be combined in meeting underwriting rules that set ceilings on the ratio of housing expense to income. This means that they can afford a larger mortgage together than either can afford separately, and can therefore purchase a more costly home together.  But this is subject to an important proviso: Both parties must have acceptable credit scores. When incomes are combined, lenders use the lower of the two credit scores. If the lower score is too low to qualify, only the income of the partner with an acceptable score can be used. Moral: Before you pop the question, check his (her) credit score as well as her (his) income. Signing Requirements of Lenders at Origination: There are two documents of concern to a mortgage lender: the note, which defines the borrower's payment obligations, and either a mortgage or deed of trust, depending on state law, which gives the lender the right to acquire the property through a foreclosure process if the borrower defaults on the payment obligation. In community property states, a house purchased by a married couple becomes the joint property of both, no matter who put up the money to buy it. For this reason, lenders require that both names be on the deed or the mortgage. They do not require that both names be on the note because a single name does not prevent them from foreclosing in the event of a failure to pay. There are nine community property states, all in the south and west except for Wisconsin.  The remaining states use common law, under which the obligation to repay is that of whoever has signed the note, and assets are owned by the party whose name or names are on the mortgage or deed of trust. As a result, mortgage lenders will accept a single name or joint names on the note, and on the mortgage or deed of trust.  Unilateral Actions by One Spouse: I get a surprising number of emails from people who have discovered that their spouses have taken out a second mortgage, or refinanced their first mortgage, without their knowing about it. In community property states, this cannot happen if the lender knows that the borrower is married. Lenders in such case will always require both spouses to sign the new mortgage or deed of trust. It can happen if the house was purchased before marriage and the borrower deceives the lender by pretending to still be single. It is relatively easy, however, for a lender to determine an applicant's true marital status. Unilateral action by one spouse is more likely to happen in common law states under circumstances where the original loan was taken out by one party as sole owner. The contracting spouse merely does it again in the same way, even though he is now married. It won't work, however, if the second spouse is on the mortgage or deed of trust, because in that case the lender will require that spouse to sign the document.  Moral: If you move into your spouse's house after marriage, you can prevent unilateral action by the spouse afterwards by getting your name placed on the mortgage or deed of trust. You may not want to do this, however, if you have some unpaid bills that could result in a judgment or lien against the property. Note that some lenders use the same rules in common law states that they apply in community property states, and always check the marital status of applicants. It then becomes impossible for one spouse to borrow without the other spouse knowing about it.  Marriage Dissolution: When a couple divorce or separate, they may remain connected if they had children together, and also if there is a mortgage or deed of trust still outstanding. If the house is sold, then the loan is paid off, but in many cases (and especially when there are children involved), one of the parties elects to remain in the house, which means that the mortgage or deed of trust remains in force. The departing spouse who is a co-borrower, as most are, will continue to be legally responsible for the debt, and as a result may be unable to qualify for a new mortgage loan on his or her own. While the remaining spouse may agree, as part of the separation agreement, to assume full responsibility for the loan, that does not take the departing spouse off the hook unless it is agreed to by the lender, which is unlikely. The very same problem arises when a house is purchased by an unmarried couple who subsequently split. The difference is that the unmarried couple can and should anticipate that they will split, and agree at the outset on the procedure to follow when it happens. I will be discussing this next week. "

      "text": "On Friday, President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama visited Miami-Dade's Coral Reef Senior High School to emphasize the importance of education and to urge students to apply to college federal student financial aid programs. \"We want every young person to have the kinds of teachers, and the kind of classes, and the kind of learning experiences, that are available to you here at Coral Reef,\" Obama said to a jam-packed, enthusiastic crowd in the gym. \"Because that's the best investment we can make in America's future.\" FAFSA Help The president announced the start of a new effort to help students fill in the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) the essential first step to apply to almost $150 billion in federal aid programs like the William D. Ford Federal Direct Loan Program or Pell Grants. FAFSA is also used by states and universities to provide students with financial assistance. The FAFSA initiative was implemented by executive order, and is aimed at the fact that many students are not taking advantage of these programs. According to the U.S. Department of Education, each year more than a million high school seniors do not file a FAFSA. Obama said this fall, the Department of Education would let states know which students did not fill out a FAFSA so that local school districts, could offer help to students in filling out their forms. The president urged all Coral Reef students to fill out FAFSAs, even if they thought they wouldn't qualify for aid. Since it was introduced, FAFSA has been simplified. In 2009 it took as much as an hour and half to fill out. Today, intuitive, online software lets parents and students skip irrelevant questions and load financial info directly from the Internal Revenue Service website. \"It takes about half an hour to fill out and it could change the rest of your life,\" Obama said. The International Baccalaureate Academy student who introduced the president, Anyssa Chebbi, made her mark as a student leader, but had doubts about being able to afford further education. \"Thanks to FAFSA, attending college has gone from a distant dream to being a very real, affordable possibility,\" Chebbi said, noting that she had applied to both Harvard and Yale. In Florida, just over half of all graduating seniors fill out the FAFSA. Coral Reef has raised its completion rate to 71 percent. The president also credited the entire Miami-Dade School district with sending a high percentage of low income students to college. Coral Reef High School Coral Reef High School is a mega-magnet school in southwest Miami-Dade County. Built in 1997 for $32.3 million, it sits on 59 landscaped acres and included a public park, 4 outdoor basketball courts, 6 tennis courts, a baseball / softball field and practice fields for football and soccer. The school is an example of the job-driven workforce training that Obama backs. The high school has an active agricultural science laboratory with a shade house and animal husbandry area. The school is divided into multiple academies, with curricula tailored to student interests: Students must apply to the high school and are chosen by lottery. The school also employs a tool that the president is backing -- a campus-wide WiFi. In 2012 Miami-Dade voters approved a $1.2 billion bond issue to improve its schools with upgrades including Wi-Fi for students. While at Coral Reef, the president and first lady watched students fill out their FAFSAs using the campus Wi-Fi. During his visit to Miami, the president urged congress to pass his more that $750 billion educational initiative that would help high schools restructure themselves into the college and workplace-themed academies exemplified by Coral Reel. His program would also help adopting more digital technology. While in town, Obama also urged further funding for his Race to the Top competition, which Miami-Dade has adopted. Paul M.J.

      "text": "How do you get passionate about ANY part of job search? Getting panicked is easy. Depressed, confused, or angry comes naturally. Especially when words like \"passion\" get tossed into the conversation by experts clamoring for you to buy their 10 Easy Steps To Passion! The way people find work is a broken system with countless moving parts, creaking and moaning and stomping on souls, leaving hard working people dazed and wondering, 'What just happened?'  So it's hard to find passion in a broken system. And the notion that there is a recipe, a series of steps that anyone could pick up and use to find passion in the job search, in the same way you'd use a recipe to whip up a Denver omelet, only makes it worse. Because everyone's search, just like every one's passion, is different. There IS no one right recipe. No matter how many followers on Twitter, how slick the web site or Facebook page or how alluring the cover of the book. There is no one right recipe. What does exist though, and what I hear back from readers of Finding Work When there Are No Jobs, in increasing numbers each week, are real stories of people using the principles in the book to make passionate moments of their own become real. These unique moments don't come from a 'Passion Handbook.' They come when a person makes a principle their own. What does that mean? It means breathing life into an idea. In your very own way. It's like walking into a dark room and flicking on a light. The light is the principle. It does not tell you want to do. It helps you see.  Then, prompted by stories of the principle in action, or prompted by anything that gets you thinking differently-- maybe a song, a walk down the street or a conversation with an old friend--you turn thinking about the search into doing something different. And almost without warning, comes the moment of passion. Even BEFORE someone says to you: \"You're hired.\" Listen to how Samantha came to say \"passion\" and mean it. Samantha's Story She just had her first job interview in almost 30 years. And she flat out nailed it. She simply could not have been more impressive. Sam is in the grocery business. She's been in it since she was a teenager. What she knows about the grocery business goes deeper and wider than any silly corporate rule about customer service, or any closing or control procedure. And as the interview at the job fair started turning into more of a conversation than an interview because of the way Sam told her story, the interviewers started to realize that this woman stood apart from the hundreds lined up for the jobs in the new chain of stores expanding into a large metropolitan market. Sam, the interviews actually began to see, could literally sense the rhythm of a store, just by walking in the door. She could feel the harmony if a store staff is working together, singing the same song. The second principle in Finding Work, 'Adding Music' resonated instantly with her. Spend your life in a business you come to love and of course you can feel the music of the business. A business school grad, or even a corporate exec might look at the principle of 'Adding Music' and say, 'Huh?' or 'Too soft. Show me numbers!' But Sam was aware, on a very gut level, of the difference between the scorecard and the game. She knew the usually unspoken ways a store was more than its numbers. And that's where the interviewers picked up on the incredibly great \"fit\" Sam would be in their stores. Her mastery of the scorecard, the numbers, was the easy part. Because she had the years that made it the easy part.  Where she stepped out from the crowd was in knowing what happened between the lines of numbers. The \"music\" of the operation. The stuff you only see if you really know where to look. In fact, she had the rhythm and feel of the grocery business down so well that the conversation, as it went on, turned more and more towards Sam's questions about the operation. The kinds of questions that only a seasoned pro would know to ask. In fact, as she started asking more and more questions, the front line interviewers had to go get the VP of Operations to answer Sam's questions. Before long, any thoughts of job interviews were long gone. There were only two people, both long time residents of a common community--the grocery business--talking about their community. A second principle was now in play. Sam and the VP were \"communitizing.\" Sam is as street smart tough as they come. Nothing gets by her. And she would be the last person on earth to let fuzzy management clich\u00e9s like \"find your passion,\" guide anything she did. So when she talked about the stories in the 'Adding Music' section, her voice showed a trace of wonder, or a slight surprise. That kind of surprise when you realize something about yourself that's always been there. But you never thought about it all that much. Never said it out loud, till she told her sister on the phone that night, \"I really do have a passion for the grocery business.\" Passion in job search. It's rare. Sometimes flashes by in a second. But when you start making principles like 'adding music' your own, it can happen. "

      "text": "\"Save your money for a rainy day\" may be an old clich\u00e9. But in an era of declining retirement security, you ignore the old adage at your peril. Unfortunately, most people find it difficult to save enough -- if anything at all -- and society is missing out on great opportunities to help them save more. This matters. Unless we change course, millions of families can say goodbye to dreams of a carefree retirement. Instead, old age will be a time of financial struggle and falling standards of living. We know why retirement looks increasingly risky. About half of U.S. workers lack access to workplace plans that build up long-term savings. While other employees are able to sign up for 401(k) and similar plans, many do not. And 401(k)s have serious limitations. Beyond that, the economy remains weak, job growth is tepid, and average wages have been stuck in a ditch for years.  Remember when people talked about retirement as the \"golden years?\" Consider this scary statistic: In 2010, four out of 10 families headed by someone age 45 to 64 had nothing set aside for old age.  So our challenge is clear: We need to save a lot more, and we need to make saving much, much easier. It should be almost automatic. Of course, people should take responsibility for their future. More people need to recognize how their own efforts to build a nest egg will have a major impact on their lives.  But it is only common sense to put good decisions in easy reach. And we know a lot of ways to make it easier to save.  Automatically enrolling workers in savings plans, deducting savings right out of their paychecks, and gradually increasing the portion to be saved over time are proven and popular strategies. They are simple measures that have a big impact. And they enjoy bipartisan support. Employers should be strongly encouraged to offer retirement savings plans with these features, and individuals should take advantage of them if at all possible.  Elected officials on both sides of the aisle should work together to promote saving for people of all income levels, and to increase incentives to set money aside for the future. Sooner or later, most of us will face that rainy day. As a society, we should be taking steps to plan for it - now. "

      "text": "If you've been following retirement trends in the news recently, then you know that the situation looks grim for a lot of Americans. For instance, a study by the global bank HSBC (released in September 2013) found that 18 percent of U.S. workers will never have enough money to retire. In other words, they'll keep working until they get sick or drop dead. For most of us, that's not a very appealing way to spend our twilight years. What can you do to avoid that fate? To begin with, we need to discard the traditional notion of retirement and replace it with the idea of financial independence. Financial independence is the ability to support yourself without relying on a wage (or government assistance). Retirement tends to occur at a particular age -- maybe 55 or 65 -- whereas financial independence can happen at any age, once you've accumulated the resources. Reaching financial independence requires some effort, sacrifice, and learning on your part. Many people shy away from planning their finances because they lack an understanding of economics and financial markets. In my own practice as a financial planner, however, I've found that managing finances wisely depends on some basic principles that anyone can understand. Whether you're 55 or 25, you need to follow these six principles to reach financial independence: 1. Know how much you own and how much you owe. This principle of financial planning requires that you know your net worth -- your assets and liabilities. It also requires that you know the rate of return on your investments and the fees and commissions you pay on those investments. Just as importantly, it requires that you know the interest rates and annual fees on your mortgages, credit cards, auto loans and other debts. How long will it take you to pay off those debts? Is it possible for you to pay them off at a faster rate or transfer balances for a better rate? 2. Spend less than you make. You probably could have figured this one out on your own. It's pretty obvious, yet so many people ignore this cardinal rule. Quite often the problem arises from housing and transportation costs, since these are the expenses that cause most people to fall into debt. Before locking yourself into a long and costly mortgage or auto loan, think about how much of your income will go into those categories, and what else you could do with that income. 3. Acquire appreciating assets, not depreciating ones. Speaking of auto loans... cars are a good example of depreciating assets. The minute you drive a new car off the dealership lot, it loses thousands of dollars of its original value. As the car continues to age, its value slowly trickles away as the parts gradually wear out. Real estate or stocks, by contrast, are assets that usually appreciate in value; their values rise with time. This means that they're resources for helping you increase your wealth in the long term. 4. Utilize the value of your greatest asset: Time. The earlier you start investing, the more time your money has to grow, and the more risk you can tolerate in your investments. Investing at age 25 gives you a huge advantage over someone who started investing at age 35. Because investments in stocks and bonds grow at an exponential rate, a difference of a few years can add up to staggering amounts. As some anonymous sage once said, \"The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is today.\" 5. Guard your assets against risk. A life-threatening illness or a debilitating injury can wipe out your finances in a hurry. It takes most people months or years to save $10,000, but that money doesn't last long when you're in the hospital. We can't prevent ourselves from ever getting sick or injured. We can, however, get adequate medical and disability insurance to minimize the damage of health-related misfortunes. In the investment realm, you can mitigate risk by diversifying your investments -- that is by divvying them up among different companies and types of assets (bonds, stocks, currencies, real estate and more). Diversification acts as a buffer that insulates you from the shockwaves of market disasters. 6. Improve your knowledge of finance each day. Several academic studies have found that Americans with higher levels of financial literacy, on average, have lower debts and greater savings. The more your knowledge grows, the closer you'll come to reaching financial independence. Some Americans are lucky enough to have jobs they enjoy. They find fulfillment in work and delay retirement for as long as their health allows them. As we saw earlier, though, not everybody is so lucky. Don't let yourself become one of the millions of workers who can't retire. If you channel your current income toward achieving financial independence, you always have the option of continuing to work if you like your job. Then your financial future will be determined by one thing alone: your personal choice. "

      "text": "If life were completely predictable or safe, the insurance industry probably wouldn't exist. But you never know what's around the corner, especially when you're actually driving a car. That's why a minimum amount of car insurance is required in every state. I don't know about you, but there are many ways I'd rather spend money than on a lackluster car insurance policy. You can't eat it, wear it, surf the web on it, or sleep under it -- although having it can certainly help you worry less and sleep better at night.  Since no one wants to overpay, you should know some surprising reasons why your car insurance rates could climb. Even if you don't get a traffic ticket, cause a car accident, or have a teenage boy in the household, you could end up paying more for insurance for these five lesser-known reasons.  Lisa S. / Shutterstock.com Reason #1: Insurers change rates frequently  Insurers attempt to forecast how expensive future claims will be, but they can't predict the future. For instance, they analyze the number of claims and payouts made due to events such as natural disasters, crime, and crashes in your neighborhood.  If the rate of car claims goes up, you might see a spike in your rate -- even if you've been the world's safest driver. And if claims drop or get less expensive for your insurer, they might lower your rate when your policy renews. Wouldn't that be nice? An insurance company might also increase rates to offset economic conditions such as inflation or lower than expected investment returns. Additionally, carriers may boost rates when they need to juice profits or maintain higher cash reserves. To see real-time data about what's happening with car insurance rates where you live, use the Rate Trend Tool at insuranceQuotes.com, a leading insurance data aggregator owned by Bankrate.com.  Reason #2: You relocate Insurance is regulated almost exclusively by individual state governments. Each has its own set of laws that insurers must follow in order to write policies for its residents.  Your state's department of insurance may approve a new rate plan for all drivers. It could pass a regulation that excludes insurers from using certain types of consumer information when setting rates. Or it could raise the state's minimum insurance requirements.  Even if you relocate in-state, you might move to an area with higher accident risk or more crime, which could cause your rate to skyrocket. For instance, a 2013 study of California car insurance premiums found that rates for Los Angeles residents could vary by as much as 33 percent as a result of moving to a different ZIP code within the same city. Reason #3: Your credit report changes Most consumers don't realize that credit affects much more than whether you can get approved for a jumbo mortgage. The majority of carriers in most states use data from your credit reports to set home and car insurance rates. Having negative information in your credit history -- like late payments, having an account in collections, maxing out a credit card, or taking on too much debt -- may cost you. A 2013 study on how credit affects car insurance premiums found that drivers with poor credit pay as much as 91 percent more than those with excellent credit. Even having a middle-of-the-road credit score means you'll pay up to 24 percent more. However, not all carriers use your credit information the same way. To learn more, read Credit and Your Insurance Score: What Every Consumer Should Know (a PDF download). The bottom line is that if you're having financial trouble that shows up on your credit reports, it can cause your insurance rates to rise at a time when you can least afford it. Reason #4: You buy a new car When it's time to buy a new car, don't forget that the make and model you select affects how much you have to pay for insurance. A racy sports car costs more to insure than a kid-hauling minivan. Not only does it attract a different type of driver, but it's typically more expensive to repair or replace. Your rate could go up if your new ride is a fan favorite among car thieves. Some of the most-stolen cars include mid-90s Honda Accords, Honda Civics, and Toyota Camrys. Why? Their parts are in high demand.  Choosing a car that doesn't ace safety tests could also cause you to pay more for insurance. Safety technology such as side air bags, rear-view cameras, and crash-resistant designs can earn you money-saving discounts.  Reason #5: You lose a discount And speaking of discounts, your car insurance rate could go up if you lose a discount that you didn't even know about or that no longer applies, such as:  \u2022 Bundling car insurance with other coverage, such as home \u2022 Insuring more than one vehicle with a carriers \u2022 Not having a lapse in coverage \u2022 Paying your policy in full, instead of in installments \u2022 Being claims-free \u2022 Having a clean driving record \u2022 Receiving a promotional discount for switching carriers \u2022 Driving low annual miles The good news is that since car insurance rates aren't fixed from carrier to carrier or even from month to month, you can always shop around for a better rate. It's easy to get free quotes online using an insurance aggregator such as NetQuote.com or insuranceQuotes.com.  In fact, if you're not shopping car insurance at least once a year, you're probably leaving money on the table.

      "text": "We all know that the Millennial generation got a bad break out of the gate: many of us graduated college and attempted to enter the workforce during the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. But now we're six years out from when the market crashed in 2008. The economy is recovering and more employers are hiring.  And yet Generation Y is likely going to continue struggling financially for decades to come. We've got two major factors working against us: a massive load of (mostly) student loan debt and jobs that offered us low starting salaries, if we managed to get a job at all. At first, a low starting salary doesn't sound like it would equate to a lifetime of financial difficulty. But here's the problem: when the economy is struggling and the job market is tight, salaries and wages drop. Any employers who are hiring suddenly have a vast pool of talent to pull from, and they can secure great workers at less cost to the company. When you have hundreds of candidates vying for one administrative assistant job, you're bound to find one competent person desperate enough to work for $10 an hour and no benefits. Why offer a $40,000 annual salary when there are recent grads begging for work and will accept $28,000?  When the economy recovers, those starting salaries might recover, too. But that's no help to members of Generation Y who started low. It's hard to make up those initial losses, and the result is that Millennials continue to struggle financially.  Oddly enough, however, there is a large corp of Gen Yers who seem to have embraced these troubles. They are romanticizing the idea of just getting by in your twenties and thirties, and instead of fighting to become more financially stable and secure, they're accepting as a fact that you're not supposed to stop living like a broke college student until you're like, I dunno, 40 or something, bro. These are the Millennials who claim money is the root of all evil. They are the ones who excessively use #YOLO as an excuse to live without worrying about the future, because who knows? Tomorrow is promised to no one, guys! Better to live it up now and come within pennies of overdrawing your checking account every month on the off chance that you'll keel over dead in the next week. These twenty- and thirty-somethings say those who are worried about making money are fools. That those seeking to build wealth are mindless slaves, destined to die without having really lived life.  The YOLO Generation is the one that fails to see it is they who are slowly selling themselves into that slavery they claim the rest of us are victims of currently. They fail to see that the shackles of working yourself to death for a paycheck that they so fear are the only possible future life for them. They are happy to spend every last cent they have because their fiscal irresponsibility is justified by the fact that you only live once -- which is true, but that logic starts failing when people end up living a long, healthy life with no form of retirement savings. The YOLO Generation has been fooled into thinking just getting by is a romantic notion and the only way to be truly free. They feel enlightened by their belief that money is evil. They do not understand that money is neither good nor evil, but rather a tool that can be leveraged to secure true freedom: financial independence.  The YOLO Generation will continue to be complacent with just getting by instead of seeing that while Millennials have struggled with a unique set of problems, we've also been gifted with brand-new opportunities. With the rise of online businesses and the digital economy, there has never been a better time than now to become an independent freelancer or entrepreneur. But for the twenty-somethings who have bought into this twisted idea that making money for yourself is somehow bad are missing out on these incredible opportunities.  The YOLO Generation will be happy to ignore the future reality they are facing: that without any form of savings, without any ability to make money for themselves, their only option is to continue working. Their only option is to continue slaving away for The Man, because when they are old and gray they will desperately need what they so earnestly reject now: money. Yes, you only live once. That is an inescapable truth that applies to us all. What is not true is that you have to \"just get by\" financially in order to really live. You can really live right this very moment and save for your future. You can really live while working toward financial independence, which offers you the freedom to do what you want since it releases you from the obligation of working for a paycheck. You can really live and have enough money left over to invest and build wealth with if you prioritize your spending and value your experiences and relationships over material possessions. You can really live by taking charge of your career and starting your own side hustle or business instead of being complacent with the bare minimum salary that some employer will try to get away with offering.  What the YOLO Generation got wrong is that there is nothing wrong about wanting to earn money and build wealth. In fact, that's a rather smart move -- and the sooner you start, the easier it is thanks to the power of compound interest. Wanting to increase your net worth does not make you greedy or imply that you're somehow failing to live while you're young. What it does mean is that you're establishing the ability to choose your own way in life instead of being shackled to working for someone else because you need a paycheck every week to continue \"just getting by.\" "

      "text": "The media is hyping it up all over the place. The economy is improving, Real Estate is coming back in many areas and the sun is shining bright today. With all this media hoopla popping up, many folks are starting to look at that stack of credit cards in their wallet and wondering what to do with them. They know they need to do something about their sagging credit score. Those extra credit cards sure look like a great place to start. Should you hold on to them and even break 'em out every now and then to boost your credit score? Or would you be better off just saying Good Bye and Good Riddance?  First up, make sure you understand your credit card is not like a hot potato. You don't have to drop it today. In other words, be careful about impulse decisions that may come back to haunt you later. Conflicting Advice from the pros? Unfortunately, if you take the time to Google dropping your credit card you will get all sorts of results. You will find pundits that warn against dropping your credit cards. On the exact same search results page you find another so-called eggspurt spouting the exact opposite advice. Worse still, some of these suggestions are (to put it nicely) just plain wrong. Lets look at the realities of those credit cards in your wallet.  There is NO EASY BUTTON here.  Sorry, but the fact is that holding on to or dropping a credit card is not a simple yes or no. Yes, of course, if your spending is completely out of control, and if dropping gets you back your financial life sure. But for most people, the reality is somewhere in between. In that case, let's take a look at some facts about credit cards and your credit score. Look at a quick rundown of your credit score and where and how your credit cards matter The single biggest factor with your credit score (FICO score) turns out to be your payment history. A whopping 35 percent of your FICO score. That's huge. But get this. Closing a credit card account won't affect that number for up to 10 years down the road. Why? It's all due to how your credit score is calculated. Suffice it to say the bad stuff, say late payments to your credit card company, stay with you for 7 full years. Ouch! But wait, it works the other way too. The good stuff, like consistently paying your credit card bill, stays with you for 10 years. Bottom line? Dropping that credit card will not affect this piece of your credit score for quite some time. The next big piece of your credit score pie comes from what those credit reporting agencies refer to as your utilization ratio. In everyday talk, that simply means how much you owe compared to how much you can borrow. For example, suppose you have you have a $5,000 personal line of credit at your neighborhood bank. If you borrowed $4,000 from that personal line, now your utilization ratio is 80 percent. (In other words, 4,000 divided by 8,000 gives you 80 percent utilization ratio.) For the record, lenders don't want to see this number much more than 30 percent for all of your credit combined. How does this work with your credit cards?  Now this is the point you want to scooch up real close and pay close attention. The details may at first seem arcane and out of this world. Yet, its really easy to understand once you read through it one time. Here goes: closing or canceling a credit card starts a snowball effect that will give your credit score a wallop it may not be able to stand. It works like this. Suppose, like most Americans you carry at least 2 credit cards in your wallet. Furthermore, assume that each credit card has a generous $5,000 credit limit. On one card, you carry a $4,800 balance. The other card only has a $297 balance. If you had not first read this article you might be sorely tempted to go ahead and pay off the credit card with the $297.00 balance and then cancel it thinking you will be rewarded for your good deed. Ooops, not so fast. Watch what happens next. If you ignore all your other credit for a moment, with those 2 credit cards you had a total credit of $10,000 and a credit utilization ratio of 50 percent. Not so good, but then again, not terribly bad. But, now you cancel the second card. All of a sudden, you have a total credit available of $5,000. Yet, your credit utilization ratio is more than 90 percent (4,800 divided by 5,000 equal 96 percent).  Kapow!  Now your credit score takes a dive and you are left wondering what just hit. It gets worse. Since your credit score just nosedived, you are most likely not going to be able to replace that card anytime soon.  So where does that leave you?  Are you starting to feel like you are (insert your own expletive right here) if you do or (insert your own expletive right here)if you don't? Look, you want to walk away from this article armed with the facts. Yes, of course there situations when it makes cents (pun intended) to cancel a credit card. But before you do so, make sure you understand the possible negative effects on your credit score. Now that you are armed with the facts, a better choice might be to know the ins and outs of your credit as found here at http://www.yourfinancessimplified.com/secrets-revealed-your-insiders-guide-to-personal-credit-repair/ Video Powered by Bank of America: "

      "text": "This post is co-authored by Diego Matamoros Of Cash, Coupons and Groupons. The cash we hold in our wallet is just paper -- but it is backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. Absent an impressive amount of folly in Washington it never will become worthless. The gift cards and vouchers we buy around town and on the Internet, however, are much different. Mainly they are backed by the partial faith and imperfect credit of private companies whose foundation is sometimes shakier than consumers imagine.  Groupon, the market leader in daily deal voucher sales, is a case in point.  We may not realize it, but just like any loan, the money we load on a gift card or voucher is actually at risk. We're betting that when it comes time to spend the card, the merchant will still be around, and able to repay what they owe. With gift cards from profitable corporate giants like BestBuy, WalMart, or Starbucks, that's a pretty safe bet.  Groupon vouchers are very different from the gift cards sold by giant retailers. Consumers make their initial purchase on Groupon's polished website, but to redeem their vouchers, they deal directly with Groupon's network of small, often struggling merchant partners.  Not every voucher is redeemed right away. In just the few years since Groupon's birth, the value of unused vouchers has apparently swelled to as much as $725 million. If the merchant responsible for a voucher goes under, Groupon promises to refund the consumer; but Groupon itself has financial difficulties, and so that back-stop holds questionable value.  In short, the company's balance sheet has the elements of a ticking time bomb which could explode at any moment -- leaving consumers and investors with little or nothing to show for their spending and investing. The story of this precarious state of affairs begins in April 2012, when Groupon settled a class-action lawsuit over its voucher expiration dates. Most Groupon vouchers previously had expired within 12-18 months after purchase. Dissatisfied consumers sued the company, claiming that the lifespan of vouchers should be not less than the lifespan of gift cards -- under Federal law, not less than 5 years. No Need to Act Now, This Offer Will Never Expire.  In an effort to combat adverse publicity, Groupon promised to go further than the law required. Groupon declared that all groupons would never expire and continue always to be honored by the merchant. And it made this a retroactive promise: All unused vouchers the company has ever issued are to remain valid forever. Groupon further promised consumers that their original outlay for the cost of a Groupon voucher would be refunded by Groupon if a merchant partner failed.   These messages helped rebuild confidence in Groupon vouchers, but they were misapplied by consumers in ways that Groupon should have anticipated. Groupon effectively encouraged millions of consumers to delay their redemptions -- and many of those who delayed have since ended up holding vouchers for goods and services that no longer exist.  While there is some financial satisfaction for consumers who do keep Groupon to its promise to reimburse the consumer's original outlay when a business has failed, this does not provide the economic or intangible benefit that the consumer was expecting. Consumers inevitably are inconvenienced and lose the time-value of the money they have spent. And so, even while Groupon is around to provide reimbursements, consumer expectations are continually being disappointed.  Merchant Failure Rates.  This situation would be difficult for consumers even if Groupon's partners only failed at business at a normal rate: The Small Business Administration reports that 10 percent of small business fail each year, and that in excess of 2,500,000 small businesses disappeared between 2007 and 2010 alone. But the Groupon failure rate is almost certainly much higher than normal, because -- as we discuss further below -- Groupon attracts many partners who are already in trouble and then, often, exacerbates their woe.  Groupon broke through during the 2008 financial crisis, just as banks were cutting off credit to small businesses at an alarming rate. Merchants were desperate for cash to pay their bills, and Groupon seems to have reached for many partners who had difficulty affording available credit and were looking for a quick infusion of cash. Groupon's bargain with these marginal operators has been a very hard one -- it keeps for itself a large percentage of revenue that it takes in from vouchers, and it insists that its merchant partners offer a discount of at least 50 percent off to voucher holders.  For merchants, taking up with Groupon can thus be a fatal attraction.  While Groupon touts itself as \"the most effective local advertising [tool] available,\" it tends to be expensive, risky, and ineffective. Expensive, because merchants must offer discounts of 50 percent or more, and then split that reduced revenue 50/50 with Groupon. Risky, because the ultimate cost of providing those discounts can rise out of control if too many vouchers are sold. Ineffective, because Groupon usually connects merchants with coupon hunters, and not, generally speaking, with people who will become loyal repeat customers. Disguised Lending by Consumers.   Consumers don't, by and large, realize that they are actually making a type of loan to the voucher merchants: that is, by exchanging cash now for vouchers to be redeemed in the future, which cash the merchants are using to pay their suppliers and employees, they are essentially purchase money lenders.  It is true that in many cases, consumers profit when they redeem the vouchers for a 'good deal.' Still, if they get to the merchant's door too late, the consumer must seek a reimbursement from Groupon -- in which case the consumer from the vantage point of hindsight has made an interest-free loan to a borrower who nevertheless paid an approximation of interest and brokerage fees -- but to Groupon.  For merchants, the loans are expensive. A consumer might pay $50 for a voucher said to be worth $100, but the merchant might only get $25 after Groupon's cut. Unless the merchant has extraordinarily high profit margins, this works out to a very high borrowing cost. Creditworthy businesses today often can borrow on better terms, leaving Groupon to feed on the businesses that are not healthy enough to look elsewhere.  Merchants basically get it -- to many of them, Groupon looks less like an innovative advertising mechanism than a loan broker, arranging bundles of small loans from consumers, and taking a substantial cut before the money reaches the merchant.  Consumers, as indicated, don't often see this side of the equation; they think about buying a Groupon voucher as an exercise in frugal shopping.  Tragic Ending?  Groupon seems likely to attract increasingly marginal merchants. And when they go under, responsibility for outstanding vouchers will fall squarely on Groupon. The Groupon Promise states: \"We will always honor your refund requests if a business closes permanently.\"   Just how large a sum is Groupon promising to cover? Since its IPO, Groupon has sold over $7.25 billion dollars of vouchers in North America alone. Even presuming that 90 percent of these are redeemed conventionally -- a very high rate in the gift card business -- consumers are holding at least $725 million in unused vouchers. Groupon could end up on the hook for much of this staggering figure. Groupon's 2012 results show that the company again sold extraordinary numbers of vouchers to consumers, beating revenue estimates by nearly $44 million. At the same time, it again failed to turn a profit, posting an $95 million loss for the year.  These continued losses, combined with other balance sheet difficulties, leave it in no position to back up the hundreds of millions of dollars of refunds it continues to promise consumers. Investors in Groupon's Initial Public Offering have already sued, alleging that Groupon improperly understated this risk on its financial disclosures. In response, Groupon increased the amount of its refund reserves, but the increase seems inadequate given Groupon's rapidly growing revenue.  What is to be Done?  Enforcing Groupon's refund guarantee on a large scale could be very difficult. Class action suits would face many obstacles, not least because Groupon leaves it to each individual merchant to track voucher redemptions, making it difficult to identify which consumers are entitled to refunds.  State attorneys general could try to prosecute Groupon under their existing consumer protection statutes, but they would face a high bar to prove that Groupon's practices were deceptive rather than just shortsighted. And if these enforcement techniques are successful they might bankrupt the company. Given the huge size of the overall risk and its disguised nature, consumers deserve to be protected from the risks created by Groupon and Groupon-like schemes of the future. Because consumers are being drawn into disguised forms of lending, the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ought to assert better regulatory control over voucher sales, and issue regulations requiring adequate refund reserves.  If Groupon reduces costs and attracts healthier merchants it could set aside enough cash to cover its refund obligations, to the benefit of consumers and investors alike. Until it does, however, both consumers and investors should think twice before betting hard-earned money on an uncertain future. Update (5:23EST 3/7/2014): Groupon has been in touch since this blog post appeared. In its response it does not critique our assertion that consumers can wind up in a position analogous to lenders when they buy a voucher; nor, while saying that our conclusions are \"wrong\" and in \"error,\" does the Groupon response deny the specific financial facts we present.  It refuses to comment on the value of its unredeemed vouchers or to disclose what percent of vouchers are actually redeemed. Instead it highlights much of the positive news contained in its latest financial report, to which we linked in our story. It observes that it has $1.2 billion in cash, but does not choose to remind us that it also has $1.187 billion in current liabilities; and that it reported losses for the quarter and the year; and that its substantial revenue increases necessarily entail increases in potential refund liabilities. We are heartened to learn that redemptions have increased relatively, but we are unable to learn what the absolute rates and amounts are. We are told that payments to merchants are staggered to help protect merchants, but not that that is the approach merchants would prefer, or how merchants are better off.  We are told that merchants can set up some aspects of their own deals to suit themselves, but we are not told that Groupon never insists on minimum discounts; or that merchants can ever terminate their responsibility to honor a voucher. See F in merchant terms and conditions. It is our understanding that a key GROUPON merchandising advantage comes from its branding which seeks to attract consumers with offers such as \"Subscribe Now to Save 50-90% in Your Neighborhood!\".  We take no issue with Groupon's assertion that it has worked with many national brands or that Groupon is more popular than ever with consumers and merchants--if by \"popular with merchants\" is meant helpful in allowing merchants to receive cash infusions.  We also appreciate that Groupon makes efforts to encourage immediate redemptions--this is consistent with our thesis that unredeemed vouchers endanger Groupon's long-term health. We stated that Groupon's messages \"were misapplied by consumers.\" We had no intention to imply that Groupon intentionally incentivized delays.  Whether we are \"just plain wrong\" about the sustainability of Groupon's business model and its future, as Groupon asserts, remains to be seen. "

      "text": "If you make a huge amount of money, you don't need a retirement plan, right? Once you become rich, you can buy what you want without worrying about the future. Just get your hands on a big pile of cash and you're set for life. The money will take care of itself. Unfortunately, many Americans hold that viewpoint, even though they wouldn't put it that bluntly. In my own practice as a financial planner, I've seen clients get into financial trouble in spite of making high salaries. Some are doctors, lawyers, or engineers -- educated professionals who earn six-figure incomes. Strangely enough, though, education doesn't necessarily lead to sound financial decisions. Here's a case in point: I once had a doctor as client. He was 42 years old and had run his own private practice for a decade, earning a six-figure income. Nevertheless, he accumulated $500,000 in debt -- not even counting his home mortgage! The debt consisted of credit card bills, an auto loan, and unpaid student loans from medical school. Amid all this financial turmoil, he hadn't saved anything for retirement. How did such a high-earning professional mismanage his finances so completely? On a superficial level, the reason is simple: The doctor spent more money than he took in. Yet if we look more deeply, we can see some psychological factors at work. My doctor client became accustomed to living a doctor's lifestyle, a lifestyle involving luxury cars, country club memberships, and European vacations. He fell into the trap of \"keeping up with the Joneses,\" and in this case, the Joneses were eminent physicians. Here's the moral: A high salary won't automatically protect you from financial problems. The doctor eventually realized that his finances were imploding and that he faced two choices: either scale back his spending, or drastically reduce his standard of living in retirement. Fortunately, he was young enough to correct course. Not everybody has that advantage. In October 2013, a Wells Fargo survey of 1,000 working adults found that 34 percent plan to keep working until age 80 because they don't have enough money to retire comfortably. The same survey found that another 37 percent plan to keep working until they get sick or drop dead. Clearly, a lot of Americans haven't put much thought into retirement planning.  This problem is solvable. You can get a handle on your debts and develop a feasible retirement strategy. Sure, retirement planning is complicated -- you have to sift through mounds of information about IRAs, 401(k)s, and the myriad of retirement plans available in the U.S. But the main idea of retirement planning is pretty basic. I call it the \"magic number.\" The magic number is simply the amount of money that you need to get from the 1st to the 30th of the month. Ask yourself: What number do you need in your bank account every month to get by? By \"get by,\" I mean several things: meet basic living expenses, save for emergencies, and maintain a little bit of money for entertainment. Whether you make $30,000 or $300,000 a year, the principle is the same. When you cut through all the jargon, retirement planning involves two steps: First, finding your magic number. Second, devising a strategy to replace that number every year for the rest of your life. Once you take those two steps, the rest of your strategy falls into place. Finding your magic number makes other things possible: 1. Knowing the magic number guards against \"lifestyle inflation.\" As we've seen, that disease afflicted our doctor friend. Like many people, he told himself, \"My wages are rising, so my lifestyle should, too.\" In medical school, he ate Top Ramen noodles and survived; as a doctor he dined on steak and premium wines. If your desires rise as fast as your income, you won't attain financial security. 2. It gives you a roadmap towards a sustainable retirement income. In my own financial planning practice, I've seen clients obsess over the right percentage of their paychecks to contribute to their retirement accounts -- five percent, ten percent, or what? Knowing your magic number, you have a specific amount to save for, and distractions fall out of sight. 3. The magic number redefines retirement. Instead of asking, \"How many more years should I work,\" you'll ask, \"how much money do I need to reach my magic number?\" Retirement then becomes a question of ability, not age. Retirement planning is difficult for many Americans because they simply don't know where to begin. But once you define a problem, solutions become possible. It's the same with retirement; many of us are lost in a sea of uncertainty, far from land. The magic number will act as your lighthouse, guiding you to financial security.

      "text": "By Jennifer Fitzgerald, PolicyGenius contributor If you Google the question, \"How do I choose the right health insurance plan?\" you'll find a lot of general information. But what you won't find is tactical advice. You won't find a simple \"hack\" for health insurance for the person who doesn't want to spend days researching and creating detailed spreadsheets.  If that's what you're looking for, you've found it. I've boiled everything down into an easy checklist, but read on for an explanation of the shortcuts you can take in this process.  Before the Affordable Care Act (ACA), there was no easy way to shop for a health insurance plan. But the ACA has standardized health insurance marketing, which makes it easier to compare plans \"apples-to-apples.\" So now you can get right to it in just two steps: 1) Decide what level of plan you want The ACA has neatly categorized all health insurance plans into four metal tiers: bronze, silver, gold and platinum. Every plan across all tiers covers all the essential health benefits; what differs is the cost-sharing between you and the insurance company. So how much should you spend? If you make less than $40,000 per year and don't have health insurance through your employer, you may qualify for a subsidy. See if you qualify. If you do, make sure you apply for the subsidy when you create an account on your state's ACA marketplace site. If you don't qualify for a subsidy, aim to spend around 5 percent of your annual gross income on health insurance premiums. That's how much consumers spend, on average, on health insurance according to the government's Consumer Expenditure Survey. It's also short enough of the government's \"unaffordability threshold\" of 9.5 percent (which is a good benchmark for this exercise) to give you room to cover your share of the non-premium expenses under any health plan (deductibles, co-payments and co-insurance). In most states, spending 5 percent of your income on health insurance premiums will also land you squarely within range for a silver plan. We looked at the range of costs for a silver health plan for a 35 year-old making $60,000 per year and calculated the percentage of income that would represent:  For most people, a silver plan is a good choice. We've steered most of the consumers we've helped into a silver plan. By design, silver plans will have a higher deductible (which is what keeps premiums lower). Silver plan deductibles will typically run between $1,000 and $3,000 per year (although there might be silver plans available with a higher deductible). Remember that a deductible is the amount of health care expenses you're responsible for, per year, before your health insurance kicks in. Make sure you have enough in savings set aside to cover the deductible -- which could come at you in one lump sum, if, for example, you end up in the emergency room with appendicitis.  If you have a health condition that requires you to use more health care services, then consider a gold or platinum plan. These plans cost more in terms of premium, but pay for more of the costs when you actually use care (i.e., with lower deductibles, co-payments and co-insurance). And in most states, a platinum plan (the highest level) may not cost significantly more than a silver plan. For the same 35 year-old making $60,000 per year, we looked at the range of costs for a platinum health plan and calculated the percentage of income that would represent:  2) Decide which insurance company you want to go with Once you've narrowed down your decision to a metal level and price point, now you have to pick among different insurance companies. This is where we've seen anxious and super detail-oriented consumers go down a rabbit hole. Here's a better way: come up with your 5 \"deal-breaker\" questions and do a bit of research among the insurance companies. You can learn how to do that online and over the phone in this article. Expect to spend about a half hour researching per insurance company. Here are some common deal-breaker questions: This invites the question: is there an easy way to compare the quality of different insurers? Short answer: no. The National Committee for Quality Assurance does evaluation and accreditation of health plans. But, these aren't comprehensive. And lack of accreditation isn't necessarily a bad thing: it could just mean the insurer hasn't applied and paid for the accreditation process (which is opt-in, not mandatory). And if two plans you're considering are both accredited, then it's not helpful for deciding between the two.  You might also see starred ratings of insurance companies on your state's marketplace. You should confirm how the ratings are developed. Are they objectively applied by an independent or government agency, or just aggregated customer reviews (like you'd see on Amazon)? A good rule of thumb when it comes to customers' starred ratings is that they're indicative, not definitive. Unless there's some calibration of the ratings, they're probably apples and oranges. What might get 5 stars in my book might only get 3 stars in your book. So don't go by the starred ratings alone.  If you don't have any deal-breaker questions, or can't be bothered with homework, then you, my friend, are a low-maintenance health consumer. Just pick a plan in the price range and metal tier you've selected. If you're not satisfied, you're only locked in until next January when open enrollment starts again. And remember that the ACA has eliminated most of the blind spots that got folks into trouble. The important thing is to pick a plan and get covered. As I've previously written about, not having any health insurance is a huge gamble with your health and your finances. There you have it. For your reference, we've boiled down this information into an easy checklist.  Do you have any tips or shortcuts for health insurance shopping? If so, we'd love to read about them in the comments! "

      "text": "Our pets have lives we can only envy. They've got daily meal service and a personal cleanup crew. And when we leave for work, they can go back to sleep ... for the entire day. And they never, ever have to worry about money. But despite their freedom from financial concerns, they can actually teach us some useful lessons about what to do--and what not to do--with money. So in homage to Love Your Pet Day, we've rounded up eight critters who have some truly sage advice to impart on us mere mortals. What Dogs Can Teach Us: Look Out for Number One Dogs may show unconditional love for people, but when it comes to other canines, they've got quite a different attitude. Whether it's a nice chew bone or the best bed in the house, the concept of \"share\" just isn't in their vocabulary. Bottom line: Dogs are always looking out for number one. Sure, as a human, you don't want to take this trait too far. So when there's a surplus, go ahead and be generous. But remember that, in some cases, you do need to put yourself first--like in the case of retirement. Making retirement a priority when you have college-bound kids can be hard because they depend on you, but money should go into your retirement fund before their college savings. Why, you ask? Because no one will give you a loan or scholarship for retirement--and you don't want to be a burden on your children when you run out of funds in your eighties. It's better to do both if you can, of course, but when there isn't enough to go around, take a lesson from your canine and think of yourself first. RELATED: Retirement, Savings or Debt? How to Prioritize Your Financial Goals What Rabbits Can Teach Us: Multiplication Is Magic There's a reason why we say that things \"multiply like rabbits.\" One bunny can have up to 14 babies per litter, the pregnancy only lasts a month--and they can get pregnant immediately after giving birth. (Gulp.) So if an average litter of six rabbits has three females, by the end of just one mama's seven-year lifespan, she could be responsible for nearly 95 billion rabbits. Of course, in the wild, not all of those offspring will survive and breed. But there's similar magic at play when it comes to compound interest--except that no one is going to eat your cash. If you deposit money into the bank and leave it alone, you'll earn interest on the interest in much the same way that rabbits multiply. The same goes for retirement accounts: So if you have $2,000 in a retirement fund that earns 7% interest annually, your money will double in about 10 years--and you don't even have to do a thing once you've made the deposit. Of course, multiplication can be black magic too. Compound interest can also be your enemy if you carry a high credit card balance because you'll be charged interest next month on the interest you were charged this month ... ad infinitum. RELATED: Compound Interest 101: How It Works What Hamsters Can Teach Us: Stop Running on That Wheel to Nowhere Don't throw good money after bad. Cut your losses. We've got all of the aphorisms we need to tell us that sometimes we should stop following that same old path. But even if, like the proverbial hamster on the wheel, we're clearly getting nowhere, it can be tough to quit. We've run so far already, so surely we're about to get somewhere. And if we give up now, doesn't all that time/money/effort go to waste? Experts say that you need to learn how to recognize what they call a \"sunk cost,\" which is the economic principle that what you have spent is already gone. To identify a sunk cost, you need to ask yourself two key questions: Are you sticking with the program simply because you've been doing it for so long? Would you still make the same commitment if you weren't in this deep? If you answered \"no,\" it may be time to finally make the break. And remember that when you persist with something that's not working out--be it a job, a relationship or an expensive purchase, like that gym membership you never use--you may be missing out on other opportunities. So sticking with the plan doesn't come for free either. RELATED: Sunk Costs: The Science of Cutting Your Losses What Goldfish Can Teach Us: Don't Overindulge Your Kids That terrible thing people say about goldfish? Well, it's a myth. \"A fish will stop eating before it gets sick or explodes,\" explains Jon Sander, operations manager at the Lilypons Water Gardens. That said, being overgenerous with food is still a big problem with pet fish--but it's for a different reason. The leftovers left floating around in the tank can create a toxic environment, which has nothing to do with goldfish gluttony. It's the owner's fault for providing more than the fish need. The lesson here? Beware of the dangers of showering your kids with everything they want--and then some. Even giving them an allowance can be a mistake if you don't do it right. Children need to learn how to make hard choices about actual needs versus wants, as well as understand the importance of delayed gratification. It may be hard to hold back, but it can be for the best. Case in point: One study found that kids who have to pay part of their way through college take their education more seriously--and tend to have higher GPAs--because they understand the value of what they're getting. RELATED: One Mom's True Story: How I Stopped Spoiling My Kids What Gerbils Can Teach Us: Diversify! Gerbils hail from the desert, where food can be hard to come by. So you really can't blame them for being hoarders--even when you're there to feed them every day, they can't let go of that instinct to save for hard times. They also know that it's risky to put all of your eggs in one basket--or, rather, all of your seeds in one burrow. So it's not uncommon to find little food stashes in every nook of their cages, a behavior that they exhibit in the wild. This way, if another critter stumbles across one of their stashes and has a feast, the family won't go hungry. The same principle is at play when you diversify your investments: If one stock tanks, you're not completely wiped out because you haven't put all of your money in one place. This lesson can also be applied to banking: It's generally a good idea to keep your checking and savings accounts at different banks. You want different benefits for each account--for checking, it's low fees and lots of ATMs; for savings, it's the best interest rates--but those perks aren't always offered at the same bank. And if you're lucky enough to have more than $250,000 saved up, remember that the FDIC only insures bank deposits up to that amount per person, so it's wise to diversify and have more than one account. RELATED: Investing 101 What Frogs Can Teach Us: Know When to Jump There's a right time and a wrong time for almost everything. Jump too soon or jump too late and you might miss the opportunity or pay a higher price. With stocks, everyone knows that you're supposed to buy low and sell high, and if you've ever bought or sold a home, you also know how important timing can be. But you can also save on more everyday purchases by buying at just the right time. You probably know that clothes go on sale at the end of each season, but did you know that appliances and home furnishings and floors are heavily discounted in January? It's also a good time to buy a camera, around the time new models come out. But with vacuum cleaners, new models come out in June, so look for deals in the spring. April is also a good time to look for Japanese-made electronics, which go on sale at the end of the Japanese fiscal year in March. Who knew? RELATED: House Hunting? Why Winter Is a Great Time to Buy Real Estate What Snakes Can Teach Us: Sometimes You Have to Shed Your Old Skin Snakes know how to start over: On a regular basis, they shed their entire skin. They also know that the process isn't easy--it's itchy and uncomfortable, and they're at more risk from predators. But it's worth it to emerge sleek and ready to move on. You can start over, too, even when it may seem like it's too late or you're in too deep. If you're in debt, you can make a plan to get out of it. If your job is dragging you down, you can change careers at any age--people do it successfully in their forties and beyond. And if you really need a clean slate, sometimes declaring bankruptcy is the right thing to do. None of it's easy, but it's worth it to get a fresh start. And, finally, one critter with the most welcome advice of all ...

They don't need to graze all day. Plus, it's a lot of work to chase down prey, so when they're not looking for something to eat, they're saving energy for the hunt ... even if their next meal is coming out of a can. No, we're not suggesting that you sleep away the day--but there are financial situations when doing nothing is best.
